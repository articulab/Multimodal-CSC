00:38:12.941,00:38:13.739,,,,"pause filler yeah",
00:38:16.300,00:38:17.461,,,"that's probably right",,
00:38:17.461,00:38:18.090,,,"who cares",,
00:38:19.147,00:38:21.881,,,,"pause filler okay what do you do first",
00:38:22.031,00:38:24.156,,,"well let's see here",,
00:38:25.523,00:38:30.970,,,"okay so I would add thirty-nine because I don't know it makes sense",,
00:38:37.600,00:38:37.605,,,"seventeen over x equals twelve over x",,
00:38:37.605,00:38:37.805,,,"seventeen over x equals twelve over x","yeah",
00:38:37.805,00:38:44.500,,,"seventeen over x equals twelve over x",,
00:38:44.773,00:38:46.160,,,"and then it be plus",,
00:38:47.074,00:38:48.550,,,,"eighteen I'm pretty sure",
00:38:49.748,00:38:50.845,,,"yeah eighteen",,
00:38:50.845,00:38:51.234,,,"you're right",,
00:38:51.234,00:38:52.072,,,"you're right",,
00:38:52.072,00:38:56.453,,,"and then you multiply by x multiply by x",,
00:38:56.847,00:39:04.253,,,"and x times x is x squared equals twelve over x squared plus eighteen",,
00:39:04.260,00:39:07.457,,,"and then you got to multiply by x squared again to cancel out",,
00:39:07.707,00:39:10.012,,,"okay I did this in my homework the other day",,
00:39:10.989,00:39:14.801,,,"x squared equals twelve plus eighteen",,
00:39:15.280,00:39:18.003,,,"yup that's about the start you forget on this one right",,
00:39:18.223,00:39:22.154,,,,"yeah yeah yeah yeah",
00:39:22.154,00:39:24.349,,,,"I mean I'm not really sure",
00:39:25.127,00:39:26.513,,,"I'm bad at math",,
00:39:26.744,00:39:27.622,,,,"most kids maybe",
00:39:29.607,00:39:30.555,,,"I'm drawing a bow",,
00:39:30.567,00:39:32.767,,,"you know what I'm drawing bow",,
00:39:33.000,00:39:34.567,,,,"mm-hmm",
00:39:34.567,00:39:34.606,,,"okay plus ninety-two because we got to get rid of that negative right","mm-hmm",
00:39:34.606,00:39:39.813,,,"okay plus ninety-two because we got to get rid of that negative right",,
00:39:41.191,00:39:43.027,,,"so then you get one zero three",,
00:39:45.351,00:39:50.859,,,"one zero three plus twelve x",,
00:39:50.859,00:39:56.396,,,"(inaudible) negative nine x equals one of three",,
00:39:56.865,00:39:59.709,,,"and negative (inaudible)",,
00:39:59.709,00:40:04.807,,,"I don't know it's like eleven and four ninths",,
00:40:06.324,00:40:08.030,,,,"oh I'm seeing just like a bunch of random ys",
00:40:08.030,00:40:08.658,,,,"so I can't really (laugther)",
00:40:09.113,00:40:10.747,,,"yeah I know it's not writing",,
00:40:11.033,00:40:13.437,,,,"aside from what it says",
00:40:14.276,00:40:15.104,,,"it's not writing",,
00:40:15.104,00:40:17.129,,,"I don't know why I'm so annoyed",,
00:40:18.286,00:40:23.960,,,"awesome track what is it pause filler",,
00:40:34.887,00:40:36.016,,,"oh I'm going to play everything",,
00:40:36.016,00:40:36.695,,,"don't write yet",,
00:40:36.944,00:40:37.453,,,,"okay",
00:40:38.291,00:40:41.913,,,"so you would subtract twenty-five",,
00:40:43.749,00:40:46.203,,,"subtract twenty-five",,
00:40:46.203,00:40:52.800,,,"so you got one over x plus forty-five equals that",,
00:40:52.847,00:40:53.947,,,,"no it should be thirty-five",
00:40:54.763,00:40:56.001,,,"oh yup you're right",,
00:40:56.001,00:40:56.520,,,"you're right",,
00:40:56.520,00:40:56.929,,,"you're right",,
00:40:56.929,00:40:59.573,,,"thank you tutor for math",,
00:41:00.650,00:41:07.235,,,"so I guess you could just really subtract one over x minus one over thirty-five equals eight over x",,
00:41:07.235,00:41:11.326,,,"then you get thirty-five x equals eight",,
00:41:11.326,00:41:12.553,,,"and then you get",,
00:41:13.052,00:41:16.175,,,,"x equals eight",
00:41:16.175,00:41:18.579,,,"eight thirty fifth",,
00:41:19.886,00:41:20.196,,,,"yeah",
00:41:21.124,00:41:24.227,,,"that's right because I don't even know",,
00:41:24.805,00:41:27.669,,,,"okay and then what do you do first",
00:41:27.669,00:41:31.530,,,"you add one ninety-two both sides",,
00:41:31.530,00:41:39.442,,,"this is the x equals scruples",,
00:41:40.320,00:41:40.879,,,,"wow",
00:41:40.879,00:41:42.106,,,,"pause filler that's really nice",
00:41:44.467,00:41:47.973,,,"I think that should be qualified as a legitimate answer",,
00:41:52.607,00:41:55.545,,,"all right and this is what happens when I'm tired",,
00:41:56.134,00:41:57.980,,,,"okay you add the one ninety",
00:41:57.980,00:42:05.423,,,,"and that equals like three hundred forty if you plan on doing that first yeah",
00:42:06.710,00:42:11.307,,,"and then negative fix x plus six x is x equals one x",,
00:42:11.700,00:42:13.554,,,"(inaudible) I don't even know (inaudible)",,
00:42:14.353,00:42:21.676,,,"so then you get oh wait no you have to subtract this you get negative eleven x to this equals three hundred and forty",,
00:42:21.676,00:42:25.627,,,"and then you get negative eleven equals three hundred and forty x",,
00:42:25.687,00:42:28.441,,,"and you get eleven three hundred and forty x",,
00:42:28.441,00:42:29.548,,,"but it's negative",,
00:42:29.817,00:42:30.366,,,"there you go",,
00:42:31.294,00:42:31.853,,,,"beauty",

00:42:35.385,00:42:36.502,,,,"they just skip ahead",
00:42:36.502,00:42:38.067,,,,"so I think we can just keep on going",
00:42:38.527,00:42:41.307,,,"okay let me see how much time we have left",,
00:42:42.440,00:42:45.153,,,"for nineteen minutes until we get to finish",,
00:42:45.378,00:42:47.337,,,"well let's draw I'm drawing (sfx)",,
00:42:59.702,00:43:02.054,,,"let's see who can fill up the page first",,
00:43:07.459,00:43:09.892,,,"I can't see any of your writing",,
00:43:16.002,00:43:16.142,,,,"okay",
00:43:25.591,00:43:25.810,,,,"yeah",
00:43:26.635,00:43:28.446,,,"at five thirty-two",,
00:43:28.843,00:43:29.991,,,,"at five thirty-two",
00:43:30.759,00:43:31.986,,,,"okay so wait",
00:43:33.121,00:43:35.729,,,"we have like nineteen minutes-ish",,
00:43:36.237,00:43:39.818,,,,"okay like I say give us twenty-five minutes to do pause filler",
00:43:42.333,00:43:47.042,,,,"so I like five fifty-seven they should come and get us",
00:43:47.042,00:43:50.953,,,,"so that's how much longer we have",
00:43:52.968,00:43:55.343,,,,"boom let's go",
00:43:57.029,00:43:57.119,,,,"math (sfx)",
00:43:57.432,00:44:00.554,,,"I'm so (inaudible)",,
00:44:01.486,00:44:03.283,,,"they say I'm sewing a lot",,

00:44:06.697,00:44:07.835,,,,"you just drive twenty",
00:44:07.835,00:44:08.513,,,,"woo yeah",
00:44:15.513,00:44:17.513,,,"no that's a good handwriting",,
00:44:17.702,00:44:18.141,,,,"yeah (laughter)",
00:44:19.378,00:44:23.432,,,"I'm just moving on because the answer is negative eight over three x",,
00:44:23.432,00:44:25.604,,,"and I can tell you that just from looking at it",,
00:44:26.632,00:44:27.171,,,,"one",
00:44:28.175,00:44:29.365,,,"oh wait I want to skip one",,
00:44:30.662,00:44:34.094,,,"x plus thirty-eight how do you",,
00:44:34.567,00:44:37.756,,,"so first of all you got to multiply it by x plus thirty",,
00:44:37.756,00:44:38.770,,,"cancel it out",,
00:44:39.034,00:44:39.293,,,,"yeah",
00:44:40.716,00:44:44.810,,,"so that would be negative two equals seventy-three",,
00:44:45.260,00:44:48.473,,,"you could distribute with that some kind of boring",,
00:44:53.648,00:44:59.837,,,"negative forty equals seventy-three x I'm going to do it on seventy-three",,
00:44:59.837,00:45:01.000,,,"and here is your answer",,
00:45:08.636,00:45:10.800,,,"all right let's go to the next problem",,
00:45:11.866,00:45:12.297,,,,"okay ",
00:45:17.902,00:45:18.528,,,,"so I guess ",
00:45:22.420,00:45:27.644,,,,"you multiply it by negative x minus one to cancel out ",
00:45:31.000,00:45:34.040,,,,"hmm",
00:45:34.040,00:45:37.405,,,"this is also my first week back at school so I'm kinda dead","hmm",

00:46:34.950,00:46:49.008,,,"so we get ten over x equals two hundred and ninety-five plus one hundred is three hundred and ninety-five equals seventy is four hundred and sixty five plus seven is four hundred and seventy-two",,
00:46:51.824,00:46:52.865,,,"over x",,
00:46:53.119,00:46:57.689,,,"so then you just got to like yeah that's the answer",,

00:48:30.000,00:48:38.310,,,"so a lot of the students did them all exactly because they also because we put two thirteen years olds who wouldn't do work in a group",,
