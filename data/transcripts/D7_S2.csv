00:09:28.400,00:09:31.200,00:00:02.800,,,,"it is a division problem do you see how it's like",
00:09:32.500,00:09:35.100,00:00:02.600,,,,"this is like a division problem",
00:09:35.600,00:09:37.700,00:00:02.100,,,,"so if I read it another way",
00:09:37.700,00:09:39.300,00:00:01.600,,,,"I can write it one",
00:09:39.500,00:09:42.800,00:00:03.300,,,,,"how did you get to one hundred twenty divided by four"
00:09:42.800,00:09:48.600,00:00:05.800,,,,"I pause filler multiplied forty over one which is pretty much forty pause filler",
00:09:50.000,00:09:51.400,00:00:01.400,,,,,"but why did you do that"
00:09:51.800,00:09:54.400,00:00:02.600,,,,"because it equals the whole number forty",
00:09:55.600,00:09:59.200,00:00:03.600,,,,"if it was one over forty that would be a fraction a different kind of number",
00:10:02.175,00:10:04.900,00:00:02.725,,,,"but since it's not it's a whole number",
00:10:06.000,00:10:09.378,00:00:03.378,,,,"so that's how I learned it so yeah",
00:10:09.000,00:10:12.200,00:00:03.200,,,,,"okay do you want to like erase this to make more room"

00:10:49.600,00:10:52.900,00:00:03.300,,,,"mine would be mint green okay",
00:10:52.900,00:10:57.100,00:00:04.200,,,,"so we were at one twenty",
00:10:57.300,00:10:59.500,00:00:02.200,,,,,"yeah here look at the equation in the cheat sheet again"
00:11:00.000,00:11:00.900,00:00:00.900,,,,,"I mean we were like okay"
00:11:00.900,00:11:08.080,00:00:07.180,,,,,"let's go through the steps so (laughter) just to show it to me okay"

00:11:26.700,00:11:30.600,00:00:03.900,,,,"pause filler what was the fraction again seven",
00:11:31.700,00:11:32.834,00:00:01.134,,,,"that is the answer",
00:11:38.500,00:11:39.300,00:00:00.800,,,,,"aw"

00:12:08.000,00:12:13.118,00:00:05.118,,,,"but well a fraction is easier when you do",
00:12:12.400,00:12:15.800,00:00:03.400,,,,,"oh you just do it over one to make it easier yeah okay"
00:12:16.600,00:12:18.400,00:00:01.800,,,,"so yeah okay next problem",
00:12:19.700,00:12:23.900,00:00:04.200,,,,,"okay fourteen equals three okay (inaudible)"

00:12:25.100,00:12:29.800,00:00:04.700,,,,,"you have to do three eight pause filler on each side times three eight on each side"
00:12:30.100,00:12:31.400,00:00:01.300,,,,"yes you got it",
00:12:32.590,00:12:34.000,00:00:01.410,,,,,"oh okay"

00:12:35.600,00:12:37.600,00:00:02.000,,,,,"can we just do some mental math okay"
00:12:37.600,00:12:40.200,00:00:02.600,,,,,"that would be nine over sixty-four"
00:12:42.000,00:12:42.500,00:00:00.500,,,,,"I think"
00:12:42.500,00:12:50.400,00:00:07.900,,,,,"yeah nine over sixty oh my gosh nine over sixty-four k"
00:12:50.400,00:12:51.800,00:00:01.400,,,,"why don't you just use this",
00:12:52.700,00:12:53.500,00:00:00.800,,,,,"what"
00:12:53.500,00:12:55.370,00:00:01.870,,,,"this it's neither",

00:13:05.500,00:13:08.600,00:00:03.100,,,,"so it's neither and you can actually understand it",
00:13:09.400,00:13:10.200,00:00:00.800,,,,,"what do you mean"
00:13:11.700,00:13:13.760,00:00:02.060,,,,"pause filler hold up",
00:13:14.600,00:13:17.700,00:00:03.100,,,,,"here maybe if I just like write bigger"
00:13:18.200,00:13:19.600,00:00:01.400,,,,"that just takes up more room",
00:13:20.100,00:13:21.800,00:00:01.700,,,,"I can write for you",

00:13:24.100,00:13:26.100,00:00:02.000,,,,,"see that works that works"
00:13:27.000,00:13:31.900,00:00:04.900,,,,,"so nine over sixty-four k equals"
00:13:31.900,00:13:36.900,00:00:05.000,,,,,"and then we have to do fourteen times three over eight right"
00:13:38.700,00:13:40.700,00:00:02.000,,,,"multiply by both sides",
00:13:40.700,00:13:46.160,00:00:05.460,,,,"so you want to multiply three over eight by fourteen and times that by itself",
00:13:46.500,00:13:47.600,00:00:01.100,,,,,"okay let's do it"
00:13:47.600,00:13:49.200,00:00:01.600,,,,,"okay so you already have it written down"
00:13:49.200,00:13:51.200,00:00:02.000,,,,,"fourteen so fourteen time three"
00:13:51.900,00:13:53.217,00:00:01.317,,,,,"I'm just going to use a calculator"
00:13:53.217,00:13:59.000,00:00:05.783,,,,,"okay so fourteen times three would be"
00:14:00.700,00:14:02.100,00:00:01.400,,,,,"I'll just do it up here"
00:14:02.800,00:14:04.016,00:00:01.216,,,,"forty-two",
00:14:05.400,00:14:06.337,00:00:00.937,,,,,"oh you did it"
00:14:08.100,00:14:10.400,00:00:02.300,,,,,"okay oh yeah yeah okay"
00:14:10.400,00:14:16.000,00:00:05.600,,,,,"so forty-two over eight so forty-two over eight equals that"
00:14:18.800,00:14:21.900,00:00:03.100,,,,"oh I'm so stupid",
00:14:22.200,00:14:22.800,00:00:00.600,,,,,"what"

00:18:07.000,00:18:08.300,00:00:01.300,,,,"you can just use this",
00:18:09.300,00:18:11.500,00:00:02.200,,,,,"what (laughter)"
00:18:13.600,00:18:15.300,00:00:01.700,,,,"what's this times that",
00:18:17.700,00:18:18.400,00:00:00.700,,,,,"okay"
00:18:18.400,00:18:20.700,00:00:02.300,,,,,"what's fourteen time wait"
00:18:20.700,00:18:21.700,00:00:01.000,,,,,"why are you switching it though"
00:18:22.600,00:18:24.200,00:00:01.600,,,,"it says it tells me to do that",
00:18:24.200,00:18:25.770,00:00:01.570,,,,"I have no idea",
00:18:31.400,00:18:36.100,00:00:04.700,,,,,"pause filler the last time didn't we do three over pause filler didn't we multiply each side by three over eight"
00:18:41.100,00:18:45.480,00:00:04.380,,,,"okay so let's go back to the first problem",
00:18:47.000,00:18:49.000,00:00:02.000,,,,"okay so we did this wrong sorry",
00:18:49.800,00:18:52.500,00:00:02.700,,,,"we're supposed to do seven over three",
00:18:53.300,00:18:53.900,00:00:00.600,,,,,"really"
00:18:54.800,00:19:04.500,00:00:09.700,,,,"so this is three and seven time forty is two eighty",
00:19:05.500,00:19:10.900,00:00:05.400,,,,,"yeah so two eighty over three equals"
00:19:12.000,00:19:12.300,00:00:00.300,,,,,"pause filler wait"
00:19:15.200,00:19:18.320,00:00:03.120,,,,,"wait is it pause filler"
00:19:16.700,00:19:18.200,00:00:01.500,,,,"wait no that's the answer",
00:19:19.000,00:19:29.070,00:00:10.070,,,,,"is it not a thing when you like switch it around the no"
00:19:29.600,00:19:30.800,00:00:01.200,,,,"it's an improper fraction",
00:19:31.100,00:19:34.400,00:00:03.300,,,,,"no like when you do three over seven times seven over three"
00:19:34.400,00:19:37.300,00:00:02.900,,,,,"isn't that like a don't be like cancel out"
00:19:40.000,00:19:40.700,00:00:00.700,,,,,"(laughter)"
00:19:43.900,00:19:44.900,00:00:01.000,,,,,"what's it called"
00:19:44.000,00:19:45.600,00:00:01.600,,,,"oh yeah you do cancel out",
00:19:44.900,00:19:48.450,00:00:03.550,,,,,"reciprocals is that what it's called"
00:19:49.250,00:19:49.700,00:00:00.450,,,,,"I don't know"
00:19:49.700,00:19:54.280,00:00:04.580,,,,,"but do they cancel this three when you do over three over seven time seven over three"
00:19:53.200,00:19:54.600,00:00:01.400,,,,"this is no more",
00:19:55.300,00:19:56.000,00:00:00.700,,,,,"bye"
00:19:57.300,00:19:58.100,00:00:00.800,,,,"see you later",
00:19:58.300,00:20:03.200,00:00:04.900,,,,,"wait okay so then so then we have to do two eighty divide"
00:20:03.200,00:20:05.000,00:00:01.800,,,,,"or should we just keep the fraction"
00:20:05.400,00:20:07.020,00:00:01.620,,,,,"or do we have to divide it"
00:20:08.200,00:20:09.800,00:00:01.600,,,,"we leave that because it's done",
00:20:10.800,00:20:17.010,00:00:06.210,,,,,"so it's s equals two hundred eighty over three all right"
00:20:16.400,00:20:17.000,00:00:00.600,,,,"that's it",
00:20:18.000,00:20:19.900,00:00:01.900,,,,,"okay now let's redo the next one"
00:20:21.000,00:20:23.100,00:00:02.100,,,,,"last time was so much easier than this"
00:20:24.300,00:20:25.000,00:00:00.700,,,,,"do you remember"
00:20:25.800,00:20:30.700,00:00:04.900,,,,"okay so I have in my ears pierced",
00:20:30.700,00:20:32.700,00:00:02.000,,,,"but I never put any earrings",
00:20:32.700,00:20:37.000,00:00:04.300,,,,,"oh like it feels weird when you put on headphones"
00:20:37.000,00:20:38.500,00:00:01.500,,,,,"and like you have earrings"
00:20:38.500,00:20:39.900,00:00:01.400,,,,,"and like I only wear like studs"
00:20:39.900,00:20:44.700,00:00:04.800,,,,,"but okay fourteen over one times eight over three"
00:20:44.700,00:20:50.200,00:00:05.500,,,,,"and then three over times eight over three would cancel out right"
00:20:50.200,00:20:51.200,00:00:01.000,,,,"one twenty over three",
00:20:51.600,00:20:57.200,00:00:05.600,,,,"wait one eleven what one one two one hundred twelve sorry",
00:20:57.400,00:21:00.300,00:00:02.900,,,,,"one one oh (inaudible)"
00:21:02.500,00:21:04.700,00:00:02.200,,,,"okay and over three",
00:21:05.500,00:21:06.700,00:00:01.200,,,,"ooh that's a nice three",
00:21:08.000,00:21:09.800,00:00:01.800,,,,,"I don't even know what this is down here"
00:21:11.000,00:21:11.400,00:00:00.400,,,,,"what did I do"
00:21:11.400,00:21:16.800,00:00:05.400,,,,,"it's like a heart by looking at it"
00:21:17.000,00:21:19.200,00:00:02.200,,,,"I don't no idea okay",
00:21:20.900,00:21:21.100,00:00:00.200,,,,,"okay"
00:21:21.500,00:21:22.600,00:00:01.100,,,,"that's the answer",
00:21:23.600,00:21:26.520,00:00:02.920,,,,,"one hundred twelve over three equals k"
00:21:28.080,00:21:29.300,00:00:01.220,,,,"but we have to do this wait",
00:21:31.600,00:21:32.000,00:00:00.400,,,,,"what"
00:21:36.200,00:21:37.400,00:00:01.200,,,,"what are you doing",
00:21:37.400,00:21:39.500,00:00:02.100,,,,,"(laughter) it's a fancy k"
00:21:44.400,00:21:45.800,00:00:01.400,,,,"this is slow today",
00:21:46.700,00:21:51.000,00:00:04.300,,,,,"oh yeah like how like a second later it kind of like yeah"
00:21:53.200,00:21:54.300,00:00:01.100,,,,,"oh my gosh okay"
00:21:54.500,00:21:55.900,00:00:01.400,,,,,"so should we go to the next one"
00:21:56.300,00:21:57.830,00:00:01.530,,,,"that's a fancy k",
00:21:58.570,00:22:01.470,00:00:02.900,,,,"I have no idea what it is I actually",
00:22:01.000,00:22:05.600,00:00:04.600,,,,,"oh (laughter) is this the next one"
00:22:05.700,00:22:07.000,00:00:01.300,,,,,"oh gosh this one looks harder"
00:22:07.200,00:22:08.500,00:00:01.300,,,,,"wait I know what we do"
00:22:08.500,00:22:09.200,00:00:00.700,,,,,"I know what we do"
00:22:09.000,00:22:09.970,00:00:00.970,,,,"are you sure",
00:22:09.200,00:22:09.700,00:00:00.500,,,,,"you add eighteen"
00:22:10.400,00:22:11.900,00:00:01.500,,,,,"you add eighteen to each side"
00:22:12.500,00:22:12.900,00:00:00.400,,,,"wait",
00:22:13.400,00:22:17.700,00:00:04.300,,,,,"mm-hmm because then you cancel out eighteen on this side"
00:22:18.300,00:22:19.900,00:00:01.600,,,,,"and you just make the other side bigger"
00:22:21.800,00:22:26.200,00:00:04.400,,,,,"okay I'm just going to like okay what's fifty-two plus eighteen"
00:22:26.200,00:22:29.100,00:00:02.900,,,,,"it is seventy right"
00:22:30.500,00:22:39.380,00:00:08.880,,,,,"yeah seventy it's seventy equals ew equals (laughter)"
00:22:39.380,00:22:43.000,00:00:03.620,,,,,"and then since you added eighteen to the negative eighteen"
00:22:43.300,00:22:45.500,00:00:02.200,,,,,"it's then just negative two y"
00:22:45.500,00:22:49.860,00:00:04.360,,,,,"it's negative two over three y (laughter)"
00:22:54.100,00:22:55.810,00:00:01.710,,,,,"you have a big question mark (laughter)"
00:22:57.720,00:22:59.200,00:00:01.480,,,,,"so you got that"
00:22:59.900,00:23:02.900,00:00:03.000,,,,"yes but that's not all the answers though",
00:23:03.000,00:23:03.900,00:00:00.900,,,,,"well I know that"
00:23:03.900,00:23:05.000,00:00:01.100,,,,,"I know that's not the answer"
00:23:05.100,00:23:10.500,00:00:05.400,,,,,"but then do we do three over negative pause filler"
00:23:10.360,00:23:13.000,00:00:02.640,,,,"oh I know the I don't know the answer",
00:23:13.000,00:23:14.200,00:00:01.200,,,,"but I know what to do next",
00:23:14.200,00:23:17.400,00:00:03.200,,,,"okay do you want the next pause filler thing",
00:23:18.700,00:23:21.000,00:00:02.300,,,,,"should we just like finish this one though"
00:23:23.100,00:23:26.000,00:00:02.900,,,,"so did you add eighteen to both sides",
00:23:27.100,00:23:28.200,00:00:01.100,,,,,"pause filler yeah and"
00:23:28.200,00:23:30.200,00:00:02.000,,,,"eighteen plus fifty-two",
00:23:30.800,00:23:31.600,00:00:00.800,,,,,"is seventy"
00:23:31.600,00:23:32.400,00:00:00.800,,,,,"yeah I got that"
00:23:33.500,00:23:41.200,00:00:07.700,,,,"okay so then you have to take the excuse me pause filler to the fraction",
00:23:41.200,00:23:44.700,00:00:03.500,,,,"and then you have to multiply it on both sides",
00:23:46.500,00:23:48.400,00:00:01.900,,,,,"again like we did the last one"
00:23:48.400,00:23:51.300,00:00:02.900,,,,"but you have to make it inproper so flip it",
00:23:51.900,00:23:56.900,00:00:05.000,,,,,"okay okay so negative three over two"
00:23:56.900,00:23:58.400,00:00:01.500,,,,,"so that would cancel out right"
00:23:58.800,00:23:59.700,00:00:00.900,,,,"wait hold up",
00:24:00.200,00:24:04.000,00:00:03.800,,,,,"if I did negative two over three time three negative three over two"
00:24:04.000,00:24:05.800,00:00:01.800,,,,,"that would cancel out right"
00:24:05.800,00:24:06.900,00:00:01.100,,,,"pause filler",
00:24:06.900,00:24:09.300,00:00:02.400,,,,,"would it I think yeah"
00:24:09.300,00:24:10.500,00:00:01.200,,,,,"because in the last one it did"
00:24:10.900,00:24:13.700,00:00:02.800,,,,"yeah and the one before that",
00:24:14.400,00:24:24.900,00:00:10.500,,,,,"mm-hmm okay I'm never going to just have to do seventy over three over two wait"
00:24:25.000,00:24:27.200,00:00:02.200,,,,,"let me do the other one"
00:24:27.200,00:24:29.400,00:00:02.200,,,,,"is it seventy over three over two or"
00:24:29.400,00:24:30.300,00:00:00.900,,,,"wait hold up",
00:24:30.500,00:24:35.400,00:00:04.900,,,,"seventy times three",
00:24:35.400,00:24:37.300,00:00:01.900,,,,,"pause filler I mean two over three (inaudible)"
00:24:37.300,00:24:39.600,00:00:02.300,,,,"over two equals what",
00:24:40.700,00:24:41.700,00:00:01.000,,,,,"okay let's think"
00:24:41.900,00:24:43.200,00:00:01.300,,,,,"two hundred ten"
00:24:43.500,00:24:49.600,00:00:06.100,,,,,"I'm just like wait no yeah wait no two thousand one hundred"
00:24:47.600,00:24:48.700,00:00:01.100,,,,"no",
00:24:49.700,00:24:58.200,00:00:08.500,,,,,"like now because three time seven is twenty-one yeah two thousand one hundred what pause filler"
00:24:58.500,00:24:59.700,00:00:01.200,,,,"hold up let me see",
00:25:06.600,00:25:07.200,00:00:00.600,,,,"two ten",
00:25:08.300,00:25:09.900,00:00:01.600,,,,,"but that doesn't seem right"
00:25:10.400,00:25:12.350,00:00:01.950,,,,,"like seventy times three"
00:25:13.910,00:25:16.330,00:00:02.420,,,,,"oh yeah actually yeah okay"
00:25:16.330,00:25:19.000,00:00:02.670,,,,,"let's just go with it and then okay so then"
00:25:18.800,00:25:20.400,00:00:01.600,,,,"and then we have to divide it",
00:25:21.700,00:25:23.200,00:00:01.500,,,,,"or can't we just keep it as a fraction"
00:25:24.300,00:25:25.400,00:00:01.100,,,,,"we can't"
00:25:26.300,00:25:26.700,00:00:00.400,,,,,"why"
00:25:28.020,00:25:28.900,00:00:00.880,,,,"I don't know",
00:25:29.500,00:25:33.100,00:00:03.600,,,,,"well okay divide it by two that is a hundred and five"
00:25:34.200,00:25:35.200,00:00:01.000,,,,"no",
00:25:38.000,00:25:40.600,00:00:02.600,,,,"find it's Gs",
00:25:41.900,00:25:43.900,00:00:02.000,,,,,"yup I'll just write a hundred and five"
00:25:47.700,00:25:51.300,00:00:03.600,,,,,"pause filler that's a really bad zero a hundred"
00:25:51.300,00:25:56.300,00:00:05.000,,,,,"that looks like a snail (inaudible) right there"
00:25:56.300,00:25:58.700,00:00:02.400,,,,,"a hundred and five equals y all right"
00:25:58.900,00:26:00.000,00:00:01.100,,,,,"should we do the next one"
00:26:00.900,00:26:02.200,00:00:01.300,,,,"there now it's a snail",
00:26:03.700,00:26:04.400,00:00:00.700,,,,,"oh (laughter)"
00:26:06.800,00:26:08.900,00:00:02.100,,,,,"okay let's just do the next one"
00:26:11.400,00:26:16.600,00:00:05.200,,,,,"okie doke now last one we added eighteen to each side"
00:26:16.600,00:26:20.100,00:00:03.500,,,,,"now we're subtracting eighteen no thirteen right"
00:26:23.000,00:26:23.900,00:00:00.900,,,,"no no no no",
00:26:24.200,00:26:25.100,00:00:00.900,,,,"well yes we are",
00:26:25.200,00:26:28.100,00:00:02.900,,,,,"because then you'll cancel out the thirteen on that side"
00:26:28.100,00:26:29.500,00:00:01.400,,,,,"and then we'll just make the other one bigger"
00:26:29.500,00:26:32.500,00:00:03.000,,,,,"so should we just subtract that"
00:26:33.400,00:26:38.000,00:00:04.600,,,,,"so just yeah just subtract it I think"
00:26:40.100,00:26:40.200,00:00:00.100,,,,,"oh"

00:37:10.100,00:37:11.500,00:00:01.400,,,,"it's going very slow",
00:37:11.800,00:37:13.200,00:00:01.400,,,,,"like I'm moving like is it"
00:37:13.200,00:37:16.400,00:00:03.200,,,,"you move and then it like stops",
00:37:16.400,00:37:19.700,00:00:03.300,,,,,"yeah I don't know okay"
00:37:24.700,00:37:26.100,00:00:01.400,,,,,"it's the sour stuff"
00:37:30.900,00:37:34.400,00:00:03.500,,,,,"okay (laughter) in fact it's actually not that sour"
00:37:34.400,00:37:40.300,00:00:05.900,,,,,"but okay so if we divide each side by twenty-five so because then what will happen to this side"
00:37:40.300,00:37:41.600,00:00:01.300,,,,,"is it will just be x alone"
00:37:41.600,00:37:43.000,00:00:01.400,,,,,"and that will be"
00:37:43.000,00:37:44.100,00:00:01.100,,,,,"what will that be"
00:37:45.700,00:37:46.400,00:00:00.700,,,,"onex",
00:37:46.900,00:37:48.000,00:00:01.100,,,,,"one over twenty-five"
00:37:48.200,00:37:51.300,00:00:03.100,,,,,"because if we're dividing this by twenty-five"
00:37:51.600,00:37:54.400,00:00:02.800,,,,,"then it will be one divided by twenty-five which is that"
00:37:54.400,00:37:56.200,00:00:01.800,,,,,"and then divide that by twenty-five"
00:37:56.400,00:37:58.700,00:00:02.300,,,,,"and then it's just going to be x alone"
00:37:58.700,00:38:00.800,00:00:02.100,,,,,"so whatever twenty-five equals x"
00:38:04.300,00:38:05.200,00:00:00.900,,,,,"I have two left"
00:38:05.700,00:38:06.600,00:00:00.900,,,,,"how many do you have left"
00:38:06.600,00:38:08.300,00:00:01.700,,,,"I have no idea",
00:38:08.300,00:38:12.200,00:00:03.900,,,,,"(laughter) all right let's go to the next one"
00:38:16.900,00:38:20.100,00:00:03.200,,,,,"okay I know what you do for this but"
00:38:20.300,00:38:20.900,00:00:00.600,,,,"I do too",
00:38:21.100,00:38:21.700,00:00:00.600,,,,,"what do you do"
00:38:22.000,00:38:23.900,00:00:01.900,,,,"you have to add them to both sides",
00:38:23.900,00:38:25.200,00:00:01.300,,,,"seventeen to both sides",
00:38:25.600,00:38:27.600,00:00:02.000,,,,,"okay well do that"
00:38:31.600,00:38:32.800,00:00:01.200,,,,"I'm going to be red",
00:38:33.400,00:38:33.800,00:00:00.400,,,,,"red"
00:38:34.900,00:38:36.700,00:00:01.800,,,,,"well I think you're supposed to be black"
00:38:37.200,00:38:37.800,00:00:00.600,,,,"who cares",
00:38:40.700,00:38:43.000,00:00:02.300,,,,,"rebel (laughter)"
00:38:57.400,00:38:58.600,00:00:01.200,,,,,"just try that"
00:38:58.600,00:38:59.900,00:00:01.300,,,,,"no no you don't have to multiply"
00:39:00.000,00:39:01.300,00:00:01.300,,,,,"you just have to add"
00:39:04.000,00:39:05.100,00:00:01.100,,,,,"like yeah let me show you"
00:39:05.100,00:39:08.200,00:00:03.100,,,,,"so you add seventeen to this side"
00:39:08.400,00:39:10.400,00:00:02.000,,,,,"then that will cancel out right"
00:39:10.600,00:39:10.800,00:00:00.200,,,,"yeah",
00:39:11.100,00:39:12.000,00:00:00.900,,,,,"so you can just all right"
00:39:12.500,00:39:15.500,00:00:03.000,,,,,"and then if you add seventeen to this side"
00:39:15.500,00:39:16.800,00:00:01.300,,,,,"what's it get us"
00:39:22.200,00:39:23.000,00:00:00.800,,,,,"eighty"
00:39:24.500,00:39:26.000,00:00:01.500,,,,"what you said eighty",
00:39:26.000,00:39:27.100,00:00:01.100,,,,,"yeah eighty"
00:39:27.100,00:39:35.300,00:00:08.200,,,,,"so right now it's negative negative three over y"
00:39:37.000,00:39:38.100,00:00:01.100,,,,"did you hear that",
00:39:38.700,00:39:39.700,00:00:01.000,,,,,"what was that"
00:39:40.100,00:39:41.000,00:00:00.900,,,,"what",
00:39:41.700,00:39:43.100,00:00:01.400,,,,,"that like like what"
00:39:44.600,00:39:45.200,00:00:00.600,,,,"I just burped",
00:39:45.500,00:39:48.000,00:00:02.500,,,,,"oh I did not hear that okay"
00:39:47.200,00:39:48.600,00:00:01.400,,,,"okay good",
00:39:49.700,00:39:51.500,00:00:01.800,,,,,"so right now negative three"
00:39:51.500,00:39:52.600,00:00:01.100,,,,,"we're not going to write it"
00:39:52.900,00:39:56.700,00:00:03.800,,,,,"negative three over y equals pause filler eight"
00:39:56.700,00:39:59.200,00:00:02.500,,,,"I can write with the back of the pen",
00:39:59.400,00:40:07.100,00:00:07.700,,,,,"so then what we're supposed to do is multiply"
00:40:09.000,00:40:11.064,00:00:02.064,,,,,"I like this stuff on the bottom"
00:40:12.600,00:40:15.500,00:00:02.900,,,,,"it's like try it"
00:40:15.500,00:40:17.300,00:00:01.800,,,,,"it's like sweet but like sour"
00:40:17.800,00:40:19.100,00:00:01.300,,,,"yeah I don't like sour things",
00:40:20.300,00:40:21.000,00:00:00.700,,,,,"you don't"
00:40:22.400,00:40:25.270,00:00:02.870,,,,,"it's actually like really good okay"
00:40:29.400,00:40:34.700,00:00:05.300,,,,,"so if we multiply each side by x then"
00:40:35.800,00:40:37.000,00:00:01.200,,,,,"what's going to happen"
00:40:40.600,00:40:41.500,00:00:00.900,,,,"(sfx)",
00:40:41.500,00:40:45.800,00:00:04.300,,,,,"so if you multiply negative three over y not by x by y"
00:40:46.100,00:40:49.700,00:00:03.600,,,,,"if we do negative three over y times y"
00:40:49.900,00:40:51.000,00:00:01.100,,,,,"what's going to happen"
00:40:53.700,00:40:55.300,00:00:01.600,,,,,"it's going to be gone"
00:40:55.300,00:40:58.400,00:00:03.100,,,,,"the y is going to be gone"
00:40:58.400,00:41:00.000,00:00:01.600,,,,,"it's going to fly away"
00:40:58.400,00:41:01.400,00:00:03.000,,,,"I was kidding there (laughter)",
00:41:01.400,00:41:03.100,00:00:01.700,,,,,"so here write down negative three"
00:41:03.100,00:41:07.300,00:00:04.200,,,,,"because if we so if we do negative y times negative three over y"
00:41:07.500,00:41:09.600,00:00:02.100,,,,,"so just write negative three"
00:41:09.700,00:41:14.000,00:00:04.300,,,,,"and then just write eighty times y"
00:41:14.500,00:41:15.800,00:00:01.300,,,,,"and then that's our thing"
00:41:16.300,00:41:17.300,00:00:01.000,,,,,"wait no it's not"
00:41:17.300,00:41:18.000,00:00:00.700,,,,,"wait yes it is"
00:41:18.000,00:41:18.800,00:00:00.800,,,,,"wait no it's not"
00:41:18.800,00:41:19.700,00:00:00.900,,,,,"no it's not"
00:41:19.800,00:41:20.800,00:00:01.000,,,,,"I got this"
00:41:20.800,00:41:22.500,00:00:01.700,,,,,"okay I was like no it's not"
00:41:22.500,00:41:24.000,00:00:01.500,,,,,"it's going to be so"
00:41:24.000,00:41:28.000,00:00:04.000,,,,,"right now this is not not the mechanical pencil"
00:41:28.000,00:41:35.900,00:00:07.900,,,,,"so right now it's negative three equals"
00:41:36.100,00:41:41.400,00:00:05.300,,,,,"negative three equals eighty eighty x eighty y"
00:41:41.400,00:41:44.700,00:00:03.300,,,,,"and then what we do is we divide"
00:41:45.100,00:41:47.500,00:00:02.400,,,,,"if we want to get y alone what do we do"
00:41:49.900,00:41:52.800,00:00:02.900,,,,"you have to subtract or add",
00:41:53.000,00:41:56.600,00:00:03.600,,,,,"no you have to divide"
00:41:57.200,00:41:58.100,00:00:00.900,,,,"what you said",
00:41:58.700,00:41:59.100,00:00:00.400,,,,,"yeah"
00:41:59.400,00:42:05.200,00:00:05.800,,,,,"so then what we're going to so we have negative three equals eighty pause filler y"
00:42:05.300,00:42:07.700,00:00:02.400,,,,,"so then we're going to divide by eighty on each side"
00:42:08.200,00:42:14.100,00:00:05.900,,,,,"and so it's going to be negative pause filler three over eighty"
00:42:14.200,00:42:16.100,00:00:01.900,,,,,"because if we're dividing that"
00:42:16.100,00:42:19.500,00:00:03.400,,,,,"and then since we divided the other side by eighty"
00:42:20.100,00:42:23.700,00:00:03.600,,,,,"it's going to be pause filler it's just going to be y now"
00:42:24.600,00:42:26.700,00:00:02.100,,,,,"so what's it all equal"
00:42:29.800,00:42:30.700,00:00:00.900,,,,"you stumped me",
00:42:31.500,00:42:32.400,00:00:00.900,,,,,"I stumped you"
00:42:33.300,00:42:34.800,00:00:01.500,,,,"I have no idea where you are",
00:42:35.700,00:42:38.300,00:00:02.600,,,,,"okay let me explain everything we did okay"
00:42:39.300,00:42:41.700,00:00:02.400,,,,,"just like I don't feel like writing the whole thing again"
00:42:41.700,00:42:43.600,00:00:01.900,,,,,"but I'll just explain it so"
00:42:43.700,00:42:45.000,00:00:01.300,,,,"wait hold on are we here",
00:42:46.100,00:42:48.200,00:00:02.100,,,,,"here do you want me to just go from the very beginning"
00:42:49.400,00:42:49.800,00:00:00.400,,,,"no",
00:42:50.500,00:42:52.700,00:00:02.200,,,,,"where did you get lost"
00:42:55.700,00:42:57.580,00:00:01.880,,,,"all of the writing",
00:42:59.300,00:43:00.000,00:00:00.700,,,,"I can't",
00:43:01.000,00:43:06.200,00:00:05.200,,,,,"okay so what we did first is we added eighteen to each side"
00:43:06.800,00:43:07.500,00:00:00.700,,,,,"you know that right"
00:43:08.000,00:43:08.300,00:00:00.300,,,,"uh-huh",
00:43:10.000,00:43:13.700,00:00:03.700,,,,,"so then on the left side we have negative three over y"
00:43:13.700,00:43:16.700,00:00:03.000,,,,,"and then on the other side we had eighty"
00:43:16.700,00:43:21.100,00:00:04.400,,,,,"because we added to the seventeen cancelled out yeah"
00:43:21.100,00:43:29.400,00:00:08.300,,,,,"and then what we did is we divided each side by y yeah"
00:43:29.800,00:43:34.700,00:00:04.900,,,,,"and then what happened is the negative three over y just became negative three"
00:43:34.700,00:43:38.200,00:00:03.500,,,,,"and six and eighty became eighty times y"
00:43:38.800,00:43:42.700,00:00:03.900,,,,,"so at this point it was negative three equals eighty times y"
00:43:43.400,00:43:49.000,00:00:05.600,,,,,"and then what happened was we divided so we had pause filler"
00:43:49.000,00:43:50.500,00:00:01.500,,,,,"let me just write this out"
00:43:51.000,00:43:52.400,00:00:01.400,,,,,"so we had negative three"
00:43:52.400,00:44:00.200,00:00:07.800,,,,,"since pause filler negative three equals eighty times y"
00:44:01.800,00:44:03.300,00:00:01.500,,,,,"oh my gosh"
00:44:04.000,00:44:04.800,00:00:00.800,,,,,"eighty times y"
00:44:04.800,00:44:07.700,00:00:02.900,,,,,"let's just pretend that says eighty times y okay"
00:44:08.200,00:44:13.100,00:00:04.900,,,,,"because we got there because we had multiplied times y on each side"
00:44:13.100,00:44:15.700,00:00:02.600,,,,,"and it became negative three equals eighty y"
00:44:15.800,00:44:16.700,00:00:00.900,,,,,"you get that"
00:44:19.700,00:44:20.200,00:00:00.500,,,,,"you get that"
00:44:20.800,00:44:21.500,00:00:00.700,,,,,"you get that"
00:44:21.700,00:44:22.300,00:00:00.600,,,,,"you get that"
00:44:22.300,00:44:23.200,00:00:00.900,,,,,"you get that"
00:44:22.500,00:44:23.500,00:00:01.000,,,,"hold up",
00:44:24.500,00:44:25.700,00:00:01.200,,,,"go back to eighty times y",
00:44:25.700,00:44:26.900,00:00:01.200,,,,"what does it equal",
00:44:28.500,00:44:30.200,00:00:01.700,,,,,"we don't do eighty times y"
00:44:30.600,00:44:32.400,00:00:01.800,,,,,"what we do next is the fourth like"
00:44:32.800,00:44:34.400,00:00:01.600,,,,,"we want to get y alone"
00:44:34.400,00:44:36.200,00:00:01.800,,,,,"and right now y is with eighty"
00:44:36.200,00:44:37.500,00:00:01.300,,,,,"so you have to divide"
00:44:37.700,00:44:43.500,00:00:05.800,,,,,"if you do eighty if eighty times y if you do eighty times y divided by eight"
00:44:43.500,00:44:45.600,00:00:02.100,,,,,"it just becomes y"
00:44:45.600,00:44:49.500,00:00:03.900,,,,,"because the eighty divided eighty just cancels out and then becomes y"
00:44:49.700,00:44:51.800,00:00:02.100,,,,,"so you get that"
00:44:51.800,00:44:54.340,00:00:02.540,,,,"yeah so now it's just y",
00:44:55.400,00:44:57.200,00:00:01.800,,,,,"yeah so it's just y on the right side"
00:44:57.200,00:45:01.500,00:00:04.300,,,,,"and then we also have to do pause filler divide eighty on the other side"
00:45:01.500,00:45:03.300,00:00:01.800,,,,,"so then it's just negative three divided by eighty"
00:45:03.300,00:45:05.100,00:00:01.800,,,,,"so the final thing do you"
00:45:05.200,00:45:05.900,00:00:00.700,,,,,"what is it"
00:45:08.500,00:45:10.200,00:00:01.700,,,,,"negative three over"
00:45:12.600,00:45:14.600,00:00:02.000,,,,"I can't do math that fast",
00:45:12.710,00:45:13.290,00:00:00.580,,,,,"eighty"
00:45:16.600,00:45:18.300,00:00:01.700,,,,,"no because like what I just said"
00:45:18.300,00:45:21.000,00:00:02.700,,,,,"it's negative three over eighty equals y"
00:45:22.400,00:45:24.700,00:00:02.300,,,,,"oh I've been using the wrong side"
00:45:24.900,00:45:27.300,00:00:02.400,,,,,"I was using the other side"
00:45:27.300,00:45:29.200,00:00:01.900,,,,,"I probably looked like an idiot"
00:45:32.000,00:45:34.000,00:00:02.000,,,,,"okay do you want to go onto the next one"
00:45:41.600,00:45:45.000,00:00:03.400,,,,,"how do you like get that away (laughter)"
00:45:45.000,00:45:48.100,00:00:03.100,,,,,"okay do you know what to do now"
00:45:48.700,00:45:52.400,00:00:03.700,,,,"we have to subtract forty fifty-four sorry pause filler (laughter)",
00:45:53.900,00:45:55.500,00:00:01.600,,,,,"I just like dropped it"
00:45:56.300,00:45:57.600,00:00:01.300,,,,,"why is that scaring me"
00:45:57.600,00:45:58.700,00:00:01.100,,,,,"it's like I'm going to break it"
00:45:58.700,00:45:59.900,00:00:01.200,,,,,"okay I'm not going to do that"
00:45:59.900,00:46:05.500,00:00:05.600,,,,,"yeah so write that down subtract fifty-four from each side"
00:46:16.500,00:46:20.200,00:00:03.700,,,,,"I just moved my little box where like I am"
00:46:20.200,00:46:21.000,00:00:00.800,,,,,"I just moved it"
00:46:22.200,00:46:23.800,00:00:01.600,,,,,"I don't remember like mess up"
00:46:23.800,00:46:25.300,00:00:01.500,,,,,"oh my gosh"
00:46:26.000,00:46:27.000,00:00:01.000,,,,,"there we go okay"
00:46:29.400,00:46:33.800,00:00:04.400,,,,,"so you just subtract fifty-four from each side"
00:46:33.800,00:46:36.700,00:00:02.900,,,,,"because then you'll get rid of the fifty-four on the one side"
00:46:49.700,00:46:53.200,00:00:03.500,,,,,"okay so then it's just yeah four over k equals"
00:46:53.200,00:46:59.300,00:00:06.100,,,,,"and then what is one hundred sixteen minus fifty-four"
00:47:06.000,00:47:07.400,00:00:01.400,,,,,"sixty-two"
00:47:07.000,00:47:08.900,00:00:01.900,,,,"I was about to say that",
00:47:11.000,00:47:17.000,00:00:06.000,,,,,"okay so right now yeah so then what we have to do is"
00:47:21.300,00:47:22.580,00:00:01.280,,,,,"what do you think we have to do"
00:47:26.500,00:47:27.900,00:00:01.400,,,,,"just what we have to do"
00:47:27.900,00:47:29.600,00:00:01.700,,,,,"how do we get the four all alone"
00:47:31.200,00:47:31.800,00:00:00.600,,,,"the what",
00:47:32.500,00:47:32.900,00:00:00.400,,,,,"the four"
00:47:32.900,00:47:34.000,00:00:01.100,,,,,"how do you get the four alone"
00:47:34.000,00:47:36.500,00:00:02.500,,,,"oh I was about to be like I don't get it",
00:47:36.500,00:47:38.300,00:00:01.800,,,,"okay so you have to divide",
00:47:38.300,00:47:40.200,00:00:01.900,,,,,"you have to multiply"
00:47:41.500,00:47:42.600,00:00:01.100,,,,"whatever same thing",
00:47:43.200,00:47:44.000,00:00:00.800,,,,"pause filler okay",
00:47:44.100,00:47:48.900,00:00:04.800,,,,,"so you have to do yeah so multiply k by each side"
00:47:49.600,00:47:51.400,00:00:01.800,,,,,"so then on the left side"
00:47:49.900,00:47:52.400,00:00:02.500,,,,"that was really weird oh my gosh",
00:47:54.800,00:47:55.700,00:00:00.900,,,,,"it looks like a highlighter"
00:47:56.500,00:47:57.000,00:00:00.500,,,,"it is",
00:47:57.000,00:47:58.800,00:00:01.800,,,,"but did you see what it looked like",
00:48:00.200,00:48:00.700,00:00:00.500,,,,,"no"
00:48:01.400,00:48:01.800,00:00:00.400,,,,"good",
00:48:04.900,00:48:05.500,00:00:00.600,,,,,"okay"
00:48:07.700,00:48:13.700,00:00:06.000,,,,,"so if we multiply k to each side we'll get four all alone"
00:48:13.700,00:48:15.400,00:00:01.700,,,,,"and then you'll have sixty-two k"
00:48:15.400,00:48:17.000,00:00:01.600,,,,,"so can you write that down"
00:48:24.600,00:48:25.400,00:00:00.800,,,,,"equals four"
00:48:32.500,00:48:33.900,00:00:01.400,,,,,"okay now we're not done yet"
00:48:34.700,00:48:36.000,00:00:01.300,,,,,"what do we have to do"
00:48:36.600,00:48:37.300,00:00:00.700,,,,"divide it",
00:48:38.000,00:48:39.800,00:00:01.800,,,,"I have no idea",
00:48:40.800,00:48:43.200,00:00:02.400,,,,,"wait oh one minute let me check"
00:48:43.200,00:48:45.000,00:00:01.800,,,,,"yeah you're right divide it"
00:48:45.100,00:48:49.100,00:00:04.000,,,,,"wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait"
00:48:49.400,00:48:50.000,00:00:00.600,,,,,"yeah"
00:48:50.000,00:48:52.600,00:00:02.600,,,,,"but what do you think we have to divide it by"
00:49:00.800,00:49:02.200,00:00:01.400,,,,,"guess what we have to divide it by"
00:49:03.500,00:49:03.900,00:00:00.400,,,,"four",
00:49:04.100,00:49:06.000,00:00:01.900,,,,,"you can just write it as a fraction"
00:49:06.000,00:49:07.300,00:00:01.300,,,,,"you don't have to actually do the thing"
00:49:08.500,00:49:09.000,00:00:00.500,,,,"yes I do",
00:49:10.000,00:49:11.380,00:00:01.380,,,,,"okay if you want to"
00:49:11.380,00:49:18.500,00:00:07.120,,,,,"so then at the end it all just equals k equals four divided by sixty-two"
00:49:19.400,00:49:20.500,00:00:01.100,,,,,"okay"
00:49:20.700,00:49:21.500,00:00:00.800,,,,"okay",
00:49:34.200,00:49:36.300,00:00:02.100,,,,,"all right did you get it"
00:49:36.700,00:49:37.300,00:00:00.600,,,,"almost",
00:49:53.800,00:49:54.800,00:00:01.000,,,,,"look at me"
00:49:54.800,00:49:59.000,00:00:04.200,,,,,"this is my short this is me as a boy"
00:49:59.800,00:50:00.900,00:00:01.100,,,,"lovely",
00:50:01.800,00:50:03.000,00:00:01.200,,,,,"alright okay"
00:50:04.600,00:50:06.700,00:00:02.100,,,,,"did you figure out what it was is it fifteen point"
00:50:06.500,00:50:07.600,00:00:01.100,,,,"fifteen point five",
00:50:07.700,00:50:11.100,00:00:03.400,,,,,"all right so then fifteen point five equals k"
00:50:13.800,00:50:14.600,00:00:00.800,,,,,"what was that"
00:50:15.580,00:50:16.800,00:00:01.220,,,,"my watch",
00:50:15.800,00:50:17.000,00:00:01.200,,,,,"did you hear that"
00:50:17.000,00:50:18.100,00:00:01.100,,,,"it was my watch",
00:50:21.000,00:50:23.600,00:00:02.600,,,,,"(laughter) I'll draw another fancy k"
00:50:23.600,00:50:24.800,00:00:01.200,,,,,"oh or not"
00:50:25.700,00:50:27.600,00:00:01.900,,,,,"okay one minute"
00:50:27.600,00:50:30.800,00:00:03.200,,,,,"let me figure out what we have to do for this just so I can pause filler"
00:50:32.000,00:50:32.300,00:00:00.300,,,,,"okay"
00:50:34.900,00:50:35.900,00:00:01.000,,,,,"yeah okay"
00:50:35.900,00:50:38.800,00:00:02.900,,,,,"I think I know (laughter)"
00:50:40.700,00:50:42.400,00:00:01.700,,,,,"how do I get"
00:50:43.100,00:50:45.700,00:00:02.600,,,,"well I think you have to subtract it",
00:50:48.000,00:50:48.900,00:00:00.900,,,,,"no no no (laughter)"
00:50:48.900,00:50:50.800,00:00:01.900,,,,"well then it's multiply or addition",
00:50:50.800,00:50:54.900,00:00:04.100,,,,,"yeah how do we get the negative fourteen all alone"
00:50:57.100,00:50:59.500,00:00:02.400,,,,"you have to subtract it by y",
00:50:59.500,00:51:00.800,00:00:01.300,,,,,"multiply multiply"
00:51:00.800,00:51:01.500,00:00:00.700,,,,"whatever",
00:51:02.300,00:51:03.300,00:00:01.000,,,,"multiply by y",
00:51:03.800,00:51:05.800,00:00:02.000,,,,,"so you're going to wait"
00:51:07.300,00:51:10.000,00:00:02.700,,,,,"oh that feels good to like take them off"
00:51:10.900,00:51:11.400,00:00:00.500,,,,,"okay"
00:51:12.200,00:51:15.700,00:00:03.500,,,,,"that's the people at school would be like put their heads (inaudible)"
00:51:16.100,00:51:21.800,00:00:05.700,,,,,"okay so if we did pause filler negative fourteen over y times y"
00:51:21.800,00:51:24.000,00:00:02.200,,,,,"that's going to just equal negative fourteen"
00:51:24.000,00:51:25.300,00:00:01.300,,,,,"do you want to write that down"
00:51:27.700,00:51:30.000,00:00:02.300,,,,,"here I'll like write a little arrow"
00:51:33.900,00:51:35.600,00:00:01.700,,,,,"why is this computer so slow"
00:51:37.000,00:51:49.200,00:00:12.200,,,,,"okay so then it's just going to be it's two hundred ten pause filler times y is going to equal negative fourteen"
00:51:54.000,00:51:55.700,00:00:01.700,,,,,"do you get that"
00:51:56.400,00:51:56.700,00:00:00.300,,,,"yeah",
00:51:58.300,00:52:03.900,00:00:05.600,,,,,"okay so now that we have two hundred ten times y equals fourteen"
00:52:04.400,00:52:06.700,00:00:02.300,,,,,"we just have to make y alone"
00:52:07.800,00:52:13.000,00:00:05.200,,,,"so then we have to do y plus y or subtraction",
00:52:13.400,00:52:14.000,00:00:00.600,,,,,"division"
00:52:14.000,00:52:17.800,00:00:03.800,,,,,"we have to divide two hundred ten y divided by two hundred ten"
00:52:17.800,00:52:20.100,00:00:02.300,,,,,"because then it will leave y alone"
00:52:20.100,00:52:21.200,00:00:01.100,,,,,"do you get that"
00:52:22.500,00:52:25.000,00:00:02.500,,,,,"so oh my god you just disappeared"
00:52:26.400,00:52:27.200,00:00:00.800,,,,,"oh there you are"
00:52:27.200,00:52:28.300,00:00:01.100,,,,,"it like you like disappeared"
00:52:28.300,00:52:30.500,00:00:02.200,,,,,"like the screen went like blue like"
00:52:30.500,00:52:30.700,00:00:00.200,,,,,"not blue"
00:52:30.700,00:52:32.800,00:00:02.100,,,,,"but like it was just like a home screen"
00:52:32.800,00:52:37.000,00:00:04.200,,,,,"and it was just like I was like what did I do okay pause filler"
00:52:39.800,00:52:42.000,00:00:02.200,,,,,"so what's it going to do"
00:52:42.600,00:52:47.400,00:00:04.800,,,,,"it's two hundred ten y divided by two hundred ten"
00:52:48.500,00:52:49.900,00:00:01.400,,,,,"so that's just going to be y"
00:52:49.900,00:52:53.600,00:00:03.700,,,,,"and then what's going to happen to the negative fourteen"
00:52:55.900,00:52:57.200,00:00:01.300,,,,"is that the answer",
00:52:57.800,00:52:58.200,00:00:00.400,,,,,"yeah"
00:52:59.200,00:52:59.600,00:00:00.400,,,,"okay (laughter)",
00:53:00.100,00:53:02.600,00:00:02.500,,,,,"so what's the full answer"
00:53:03.300,00:53:04.800,00:00:01.500,,,,"y equals negative fourteen",
00:53:05.500,00:53:06.200,00:00:00.700,,,,,"over"
00:53:07.700,00:53:09.800,00:00:02.100,,,,"y I have no idea",
00:53:10.700,00:53:11.300,00:00:00.600,,,,,"two hundred ten"
00:53:12.100,00:53:20.900,00:00:08.800,,,,,"because if we have to divide two hundred ten y pause filler by two hundred ten you also have to do that to the other side"
00:53:20.900,00:53:22.500,00:00:01.600,,,,,"because since we're trying to get y alone"
00:53:22.800,00:53:26.500,00:00:03.700,,,,,"so we had to divide two hundred ten to each side"
00:53:26.800,00:53:28.900,00:00:02.100,,,,,"so then the other side just became y"
00:53:28.900,00:53:34.200,00:00:05.300,,,,,"and the other side is now negative fourteen divided by two hundred ten"
00:53:36.900,00:53:38.300,00:00:01.400,,,,,"you got it"
00:53:38.300,00:53:40.600,00:00:02.300,,,,,"all right want to go to the next one"
00:53:40.600,00:53:41.400,00:00:00.800,,,,,"I think they might be coming"
00:53:41.400,00:53:41.900,00:00:00.500,,,,,"yeah they're coming"
00:53:41.900,00:53:43.600,00:00:01.700,,,,,"wait are they coming yeah"
00:53:45.000,00:53:47.000,00:00:02.000,,,,,"no okay pause filler"
00:53:47.200,00:53:48.600,00:00:01.400,,,,,"let's go to the next one"
00:53:54.100,00:53:57.700,00:00:03.600,,,,,"I did it like the first time I"
00:53:58.100,00:53:59.300,00:00:01.200,,,,"actually that was me",
00:53:59.300,00:54:03.200,00:00:03.900,,,,,"oh that was oh wait maybe we just both pressed it at the same time"
00:54:03.200,00:54:04.800,00:00:01.600,,,,,"okay so for this one you have to oh"
00:54:04.800,00:54:08.200,00:00:03.400,,,"okay that is all the time that we have",,
00:54:08.200,00:54:09.700,00:00:01.500,,,"pause filler I'll be right back",,
00:54:09.000,00:54:10.000,00:00:01.000,,,,,"all right"
00:54:10.600,00:54:31.700,00:00:21.100,,"great so you're done with the (inaudible) today we're going to end the call in just a couple of minutes so you can just stay on (inaudible)",,,
