00:34:41.272,00:34:42.460,00:00:01.188,,,I've never seen X-men
00:34:42.529,00:34:43.637,00:00:01.108,,,but I really want to
00:34:43.637,00:34:44.595,00:00:00.958,,oh yeah absolutely yes,
00:34:45.167,00:34:50.192,00:00:05.025,,I watched the split second like the newer one like four times this week,
00:34:50.392,00:34:51.519,00:00:01.127,,it's really bad,
00:34:51.609,00:34:54.802,00:00:03.193,,yesterday I watched it into I watched two movies yesterday,
00:34:55.071,00:34:56.920,00:00:01.849,,so this is why I'm very tired,
00:34:58.193,00:34:59.813,00:00:01.620,,and got no sleep whatsoever,
00:34:59.990,00:35:02.193,00:00:02.203,,but you know it's okay,
00:35:06.492,00:35:09.638,00:00:03.146,,I've looked every time when I walked by the lake what is going on in that room,
00:35:09.638,00:35:12.641,00:00:03.003,,or the child with bright red hair doing weird things,
00:35:15.737,00:35:17.261,00:00:01.524,,the red ones are kind of okay,
00:35:18.448,00:35:21.511,00:00:03.063,,,yeah but they all taste like really weird and like medicine
00:35:21.511,00:35:22.598,00:00:01.087,,,but like a weird mecidine
00:35:22.802,00:35:24.803,00:00:02.001,,it tastes like children's Tylenol,
00:35:25.193,00:35:25.422,00:00:00.229,,,yeah
00:35:26.890,00:35:27.906,00:00:01.016,,that's what they taste like,
00:35:27.906,00:35:32.007,00:00:04.101,,that's why I don't like those because nobody likes children's Tylenol so,
00:35:32.007,00:35:32.220,00:00:00.213,,that's why I don't like those because nobody likes children's Tylenol so,oh they're coming back

00:35:41.638,00:35:43.913,00:00:02.275,,the problem is the glass on this door it's like on the right so I can't see her cuz the hall's on the left (inaudible),
00:35:44.090,00:35:44.339,00:00:00.249,okay (inaudible),,
00:35:45.122,00:35:45.732,00:00:00.610,,yeah sure,
00:35:53.027,00:35:53.387,00:00:00.360,,okay,
00:35:56.572,00:35:57.489,00:00:00.917,,this thing is going to take longer though,
00:35:57.489,00:35:57.938,00:00:00.449,yes,this thing is going to take longer though,
00:35:57.938,00:35:58.980,00:00:01.042,,this thing is going to take longer though,
00:35:59.819,00:36:00.113,00:00:00.294,,yeah,
00:36:00.300,00:36:01.097,00:00:00.797,,so I go back to the beginning,
00:36:02.510,00:36:03.052,00:00:00.542,,thank you,
00:36:03.180,00:36:04.145,00:00:00.965,,(inaudible),
00:36:05.976,00:36:07.024,00:00:01.048,,all right,
00:36:08.275,00:36:13.500,00:00:05.225,,let's times it by x that's right,
00:36:13.842,00:36:15.927,00:00:02.085,,,she has to give me my pen
00:36:17.194,00:36:19.848,00:00:02.654,,one equals twenty-five x,
00:36:19.848,00:36:25.303,00:00:05.455,,one twenty fifth equals x ,
00:36:27.750,00:36:28.638,00:00:00.888,,,that is great
00:36:30.752,00:36:32.085,00:00:01.333,,that's called art,
00:36:32.867,00:36:33.339,00:00:00.472,,(laughter),
00:36:34.545,00:36:38.767,00:00:04.222,,  x and circle and well I don't know why I'm doing it,
00:36:38.880,00:36:40.232,00:00:01.352,,oh wait mine's the wrong color hold on,
00:36:40.990,00:36:42.637,00:00:01.647,,I was supposed to write on black right,
00:36:43.924,00:36:46.213,00:00:02.289,,okay so negative three (inaudible),
00:36:48.306,00:36:50.786,00:00:02.480,, okay let's start over cross it out ,
00:36:52.165,00:36:56.774,00:00:04.609,,so sixty-three plus seventeen is nine eighty right,
00:36:57.922,00:37:02.950,00:00:05.028,,negative three y equals eighty times y times y,
00:37:03.300,00:37:06.881,00:00:03.581,,so negative three equals eighty y,
00:37:06.881,00:37:11.085,00:00:04.204,,so negative three over eighty equals y,
00:37:12.319,00:37:12.549,00:00:00.230,,,yup
00:37:13.647,00:37:13.920,00:00:00.273,,okay,
00:37:15.512,00:37:17.807,00:00:02.295,,and we subtract the fifty-four,
00:37:20.835,00:37:22.117,00:00:01.282,,what would that be hold on,
00:37:22.117,00:37:23.414,00:00:01.297,,,sixty-two
00:37:23.522,00:37:24.377,00:00:00.855,,thank you,
00:37:25.312,00:37:26.590,00:00:01.278,,four k,
00:37:27.980,00:37:29.350,00:00:01.370,,okay I didn't mention any word,
00:37:30.102,00:37:31.101,00:00:00.999,,sixty-two ,
00:37:32.277,00:37:35.420,00:00:03.143,,times k times k,
00:37:35.905,00:37:44.436,00:00:08.531,,four equals sixty-two k divide that by sixty two divided by sixty two over thirty-one,
00:37:44.745,00:37:49.564,00:00:04.819,,,wait wouldn't it just oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:37:49.634,00:37:49.914,00:00:00.280,,,sorry
00:37:51.201,00:37:51.473,00:00:00.272,,,continue
00:37:51.473,00:37:51.769,00:00:00.296,,ops,continue
00:37:51.769,00:37:52.387,00:00:00.618,,ops,
00:37:52.893,00:37:55.487,00:00:02.594,,oh wait I don't know I'm going to do that,
00:37:55.940,00:37:58.205,00:00:02.265,,two hundred and ten y,
00:37:58.873,00:38:00.649,00:00:01.776,,I still can't write with the mouse,
00:38:00.679,00:38:02.665,00:00:01.986,,equals negative fourteen,
00:38:05.033,00:38:10.976,00:00:05.943,,so that would be like seven one zero five,
00:38:12.941,00:38:13.739,00:00:00.798,,,pause filler yeah
00:38:16.300,00:38:17.461,00:00:01.161,,that's probably right,
00:38:17.461,00:38:18.090,00:00:00.629,,who cares,
00:38:19.147,00:38:21.881,00:00:02.734,,,pause filler okay what do you do first
00:38:22.031,00:38:24.156,00:00:02.125,,well let's see here,
00:38:25.523,00:38:30.970,00:00:05.447,,okay so I would add thirty-nine because I don't know it makes sense,
00:38:37.600,00:38:37.605,00:00:00.005,,seventeen over x equals twelve over x,
00:38:37.605,00:38:37.805,00:00:00.200,,seventeen over x equals twelve over x,yeah
00:38:37.805,00:38:44.500,00:00:06.695,,seventeen over x equals twelve over x,
00:38:44.773,00:38:46.160,00:00:01.387,,and then it be plus,
00:38:47.074,00:38:48.550,00:00:01.476,,,eighteen I'm pretty sure
00:38:49.748,00:38:50.845,00:00:01.097,,yeah eighteen,
00:38:50.845,00:38:51.234,00:00:00.389,,you're right,
00:38:51.234,00:38:52.072,00:00:00.838,,you're right,
00:38:52.072,00:38:56.453,00:00:04.381,,and then you multiply by x multiply by x,
00:38:56.847,00:39:04.253,00:00:07.406,,and x times x is x squared equals twelve over x squared plus eighteen,
00:39:04.260,00:39:07.457,00:00:03.197,,and then you got to multiply by x squared again to cancel out,
00:39:07.707,00:39:10.012,00:00:02.305,,okay I did this in my homework the other day,
00:39:10.989,00:39:14.801,00:00:03.812,,x squared equals twelve plus eighteen,
00:39:15.280,00:39:18.003,00:00:02.723,,yup that's about the start you forget on this one right,
00:39:18.223,00:39:22.154,00:00:03.931,,,yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:39:22.154,00:39:24.349,00:00:02.195,,,I mean I'm not really sure
00:39:25.127,00:39:26.513,00:00:01.386,,I'm bad at math,
00:39:26.744,00:39:27.622,00:00:00.878,,,most kids maybe
00:39:29.607,00:39:30.555,00:00:00.948,,I'm drawing a bow,
00:39:30.567,00:39:32.767,00:00:02.200,,you know what I'm drawing bow,
00:39:33.000,00:39:34.567,00:00:01.567,,,mm-hmm
00:39:34.567,00:39:34.606,00:00:00.039,,okay plus ninety-two because we got to get rid of that negative right,mm-hmm
00:39:34.606,00:39:39.813,00:00:05.207,,okay plus ninety-two because we got to get rid of that negative right,
00:39:41.191,00:39:43.027,00:00:01.836,,so then you get one zero three,
00:39:45.351,00:39:50.859,00:00:05.508,,one zero three plus twelve x,
00:39:50.859,00:39:56.396,00:00:05.537,,(inaudible) negative nine x equals one of three,
00:39:56.865,00:39:59.709,00:00:02.844,,and negative (inaudible),
00:39:59.709,00:40:04.807,00:00:05.098,,I don't know it's like eleven and four ninths,
00:40:06.324,00:40:08.030,00:00:01.706,,,oh I'm seeing just like a bunch of random ys
00:40:08.030,00:40:08.658,00:00:00.628,,,so I can't really (laugther)
00:40:09.113,00:40:10.747,00:00:01.634,,yeah I know it's not writing,
00:40:11.033,00:40:13.437,00:00:02.404,,,aside from what it says
00:40:14.276,00:40:15.104,00:00:00.828,,it's not writing,
00:40:15.104,00:40:17.129,00:00:02.025,,I don't know why I'm so annoyed,
00:40:18.286,00:40:23.960,00:00:05.674,,awesome track what is it pause filler,
00:40:34.887,00:40:36.016,00:00:01.129,,oh I'm going to play everything,
00:40:36.016,00:40:36.695,00:00:00.679,,don't write yet,
00:40:36.944,00:40:37.453,00:00:00.509,,,okay
00:40:38.291,00:40:41.913,00:00:03.622,,so you would subtract twenty-five,
00:40:43.749,00:40:46.203,00:00:02.454,,subtract twenty-five,
00:40:46.203,00:40:52.800,00:00:06.597,,so you got one over x plus forty-five equals that,
00:40:52.847,00:40:53.947,00:00:01.100,,,no it should be thirty-five
00:40:54.763,00:40:56.001,00:00:01.238,,oh yup you're right,
00:40:56.001,00:40:56.520,00:00:00.519,,you're right,
00:40:56.520,00:40:56.929,00:00:00.409,,you're right,
00:40:56.929,00:40:59.573,00:00:02.644,,thank you tutor for math,
00:41:00.650,00:41:07.235,00:00:06.585,,so I guess you could just really subtract one over x minus one over thirty-five equals eight over x,
00:41:07.235,00:41:11.326,00:00:04.091,,then you get thirty-five x equals eight,
00:41:11.326,00:41:12.553,00:00:01.227,,and then you get,
00:41:13.052,00:41:16.175,00:00:03.123,,,x equals eight
00:41:16.175,00:41:18.579,00:00:02.404,,eight thirty fifth,
00:41:19.886,00:41:20.196,00:00:00.310,,,yeah
00:41:21.124,00:41:24.227,00:00:03.103,,that's right because I don't even know,
00:41:24.805,00:41:27.669,00:00:02.864,,,okay and then what do you do first
00:41:27.669,00:41:31.530,00:00:03.861,,you add one ninety-two both sides,
00:41:31.530,00:41:39.442,00:00:07.912,,this is the x equals scruples,
00:41:40.320,00:41:40.879,00:00:00.559,,,wow
00:41:40.879,00:41:42.106,00:00:01.227,,,pause filler that's really nice
00:41:44.467,00:41:47.973,00:00:03.506,,I think that should be qualified as a legitimate answer,
00:41:52.607,00:41:55.545,00:00:02.938,,all right and this is what happens when I'm tired,
00:41:56.134,00:41:57.980,00:00:01.846,,,okay you add the one ninety
00:41:57.980,00:42:05.423,00:00:07.443,,,and that equals like three hundred forty if you plan on doing that first yeah
00:42:06.710,00:42:11.307,00:00:04.597,,and then negative fix x plus six x is x equals one x,
00:42:11.700,00:42:13.554,00:00:01.854,,(inaudible) I don't even know (inaudible),
00:42:14.353,00:42:21.676,00:00:07.323,,so then you get oh wait no you have to subtract this you get negative eleven x to this equals three hundred and forty,
00:42:21.676,00:42:25.627,00:00:03.951,,and then you get negative eleven equals three hundred and forty x,
00:42:25.687,00:42:28.441,00:00:02.754,,and you get eleven three hundred and forty x,
00:42:28.441,00:42:29.548,00:00:01.107,,but it's negative,
00:42:29.817,00:42:30.366,00:00:00.549,,there you go,
00:42:31.294,00:42:31.853,00:00:00.559,,,beauty
00:42:31.853,00:42:33.220,00:00:01.367,,stop come on,
00:42:33.220,00:42:35.385,00:00:02.165,,can I go get them so we can,
00:42:35.385,00:42:36.502,00:00:01.117,,,they just skip ahead
00:42:36.502,00:42:38.067,00:00:01.565,,,so I think we can just keep on going
00:42:38.527,00:42:41.307,00:00:02.780,,okay let me see how much time we have left,
00:42:42.440,00:42:45.153,00:00:02.713,,for nineteen minutes until we get to finish,
00:42:45.378,00:42:47.337,00:00:01.959,,well let's draw I'm drawing (sfx),
00:42:59.702,00:43:02.054,00:00:02.352,,let's see who can fill up the page first,
00:43:07.459,00:43:09.892,00:00:02.433,,I can't see any of your writing,
00:43:16.002,00:43:16.142,00:00:00.140,,,okay
00:43:25.591,00:43:25.810,00:00:00.219,,,yeah
00:43:26.635,00:43:28.446,00:00:01.811,,at five thirty-two,
00:43:28.843,00:43:29.991,00:00:01.148,,,at five thirty-two
00:43:30.759,00:43:31.986,00:00:01.227,,,okay so wait
00:43:33.121,00:43:35.729,00:00:02.608,,we have like nineteen minutes-ish,
00:43:36.237,00:43:39.818,00:00:03.581,,,okay like I say give us twenty-five minutes to do pause filler
00:43:42.333,00:43:47.042,00:00:04.709,,,so I like five fifty-seven they should come and get us
00:43:47.042,00:43:50.953,00:00:03.911,,,so that's how much longer we have
00:43:52.968,00:43:55.343,00:00:02.375,,,boom let's go
00:43:57.029,00:43:57.119,00:00:00.090,,,math (sfx)
00:43:57.432,00:44:00.554,00:00:03.122,,I'm so (inaudible),
00:44:01.486,00:44:03.283,00:00:01.797,,they say I'm sewing a lot,
00:44:05.420,00:44:06.697,00:00:01.277,,,okay what you do
00:44:06.697,00:44:07.835,00:00:01.138,,,you just drive twenty
00:44:07.835,00:44:08.513,00:00:00.678,,,woo yeah
00:44:15.513,00:44:17.513,0 days 00:00,,no that's a good handwriting,
00:44:17.702,00:44:18.141,00:00:00.439,,,yeah (laughter)
00:44:19.378,00:44:23.432,00:00:04.054,,I'm just moving on because the answer is negative eight over three x,
00:44:23.432,00:44:25.604,00:00:02.172,,and I can tell you that just from looking at it,
00:44:26.632,00:44:27.171,00:00:00.539,,,one
00:44:28.175,00:44:29.365,00:00:01.190,,oh wait I want to skip one,
00:44:30.662,00:44:34.094,00:00:03.432,,x plus thirty-eight how do you,
00:44:34.567,00:44:37.756,00:00:03.189,,so first of all you got to multiply it by x plus thirty,
00:44:37.756,00:44:38.770,00:00:01.014,,cancel it out,
00:44:39.034,00:44:39.293,00:00:00.259,,,yeah
00:44:40.716,00:44:44.810,00:00:04.094,,so that would be negative two equals seventy-three,
00:44:45.260,00:44:48.473,00:00:03.213,,you could distribute with that some kind of boring,
00:44:53.648,00:44:59.837,00:00:06.189,,negative forty equals seventy-three x I'm going to do it on seventy-three,
00:44:59.837,00:45:01.000,00:00:01.163,,and here is your answer,
00:45:08.636,00:45:10.800,00:00:02.164,,all right let's go to the next problem,
00:45:11.866,00:45:12.297,00:00:00.431,,,okay 
00:45:17.902,00:45:18.528,00:00:00.626,,,so I guess 
00:45:22.420,00:45:27.644,00:00:05.224,,,you multiply it by negative x minus one to cancel out 
00:45:31.000,00:45:34.040,00:00:03.040,,,hmm
00:45:34.040,00:45:37.405,00:00:03.365,,this is also my first week back at school so I'm kinda dead,hmm
00:45:37.405,00:45:38.430,00:00:01.025,,,hmm
00:45:39.459,00:45:40.946,00:00:01.487,,just what we could go back,
00:45:41.751,00:45:44.834,00:00:03.083,,,my spring break was like in the middle of March or something
00:45:45.702,00:45:47.418,00:00:01.716,,,so it was like four weeks ago
00:45:48.486,00:45:52.148,00:00:03.662,,mine was like three weeks long because there was a debate thing (inaudible),
00:45:52.243,00:45:56.148,00:00:03.905,,but it wasn't even intentional the computer did that,
00:45:56.737,00:46:01.635,00:00:04.898,,kind of like love each other you know,
00:46:02.756,00:46:04.108,00:00:01.352,,I love to figure out how to do this,
00:46:04.121,00:46:06.156,00:00:02.035,,you shouldn't let homework I'll just like skip this problem,
00:46:06.156,00:46:08.500,00:00:02.344,,and be like I'll do it later,
00:46:09.310,00:46:10.586,00:00:01.276,,and then never do it (inaudible),
00:46:10.586,00:46:11.392,00:00:00.806,,and then never do it (inaudible),okay so well then there would be like you didn't do your work
00:46:11.392,00:46:15.455,00:00:04.063,,,okay so well then there would be like you didn't do your work
00:46:15.534,00:46:18.797,00:00:03.263,,,you're such a fail zero now huh and then
00:46:18.797,00:46:21.689,00:00:02.892,,my teacher don't even care anymore she used to,
00:46:21.689,00:46:25.000,00:00:03.311,,but not like oh well I guess I'll give you an a anyway,
00:46:25.000,00:46:25.462,00:00:00.462,,but not like oh well I guess I'll give you an a anyway,(inaudible)
00:46:25.462,00:46:25.921,00:00:00.459,,,(inaudible)
00:46:25.921,00:46:28.770,00:00:02.849,,there I'm just kidding,(inaudible)
00:46:28.770,00:46:29.608,00:00:00.838,,,(inaudible)
00:46:29.608,00:46:31.788,00:00:02.180,,I'm still too confused,(inaudible)
00:46:31.788,00:46:32.739,00:00:00.951,,out of hundred seventy-seven,(inaudible)
00:46:32.739,00:46:34.711,00:00:01.972,,out of hundred seventy-seven,
00:46:34.950,00:46:49.008,00:00:14.058,,so we get ten over x equals two hundred and ninety-five plus one hundred is three hundred and ninety-five equals seventy is four hundred and sixty five plus seven is four hundred and seventy-two,
00:46:51.824,00:46:52.865,00:00:01.041,,over x,
00:46:53.119,00:46:57.689,00:00:04.570,,so then you just got to like yeah that's the answer,
00:46:59.804,00:47:04.433,00:00:04.629,,,oh well oh well let's just let's just forget about that one
00:47:04.643,00:47:08.554,00:00:03.911,,we just did this you just cleared the page,
00:47:13.892,00:47:17.486,00:00:03.594,,I don't know what I'm drawing I just feel like drawing,
00:47:19.500,00:47:22.256,00:00:02.756,,I'm just trying to kill time so we don't have to do all of them,
00:47:24.013,00:47:25.675,00:00:01.662,,this sounds like me on my homework,
00:47:25.675,00:47:27.905,00:00:02.230,,and then she always goes over in class,
00:47:27.905,00:47:29.459,00:00:01.554,,so like if you didn't do it,
00:47:29.459,00:47:30.946,00:00:01.487,,you're really not that screwed,
00:47:32.351,00:47:34.914,00:00:02.563,,I also like (inaudible) she looks for her like that,
00:47:34.914,00:47:37.568,00:00:02.654,,,I feel kind of bad (laughter) (inaudible)
00:47:46.486,00:47:50.919,00:00:04.433,,well this is what happens when you put two thirteen year olds on FaceTime,
00:47:50.919,00:47:51.327,00:00:00.408,,and to talk about class,
00:47:51.327,00:47:52.394,00:00:01.067,,and to talk about class,and make them do math yeah
00:47:52.394,00:47:52.837,00:00:00.443,,and to talk about class,
00:47:53.013,00:47:54.659,00:00:01.646,,because they end up talking about other things,
00:47:54.659,00:47:55.202,00:00:00.543,,because they end up talking about other things,and we have like little pens
00:47:55.202,00:47:56.365,00:00:01.163,,,and we have like little pens
00:47:56.365,00:47:57.932,00:00:01.567,,,like I can't just not doodle
00:47:59.689,00:48:00.925,00:00:01.236,,I doddle on everything,
00:48:01.054,00:48:03.067,00:00:02.013,,oh she's (inaudible),
00:48:04.608,00:48:06.000,00:00:01.392,,oh what I'm drawing,
00:48:06.000,00:48:09.000,0 days 00:00,,(sfx),
00:48:09.865,00:48:14.215,00:00:04.350,,,these are also like complicated
00:48:14.215,00:48:20.041,00:00:05.826,,,do you know what time it is
00:48:21.000,00:48:21.256,00:00:00.256,,yeah,
00:48:21.309,00:48:23.675,00:00:02.366,,amazing we can do as soon as we finish,
00:48:23.973,00:48:24.900,00:00:00.927,,I'm kidding,
00:48:24.973,00:48:27.446,00:00:02.473,,that's five forty-seven,
00:48:27.485,00:48:29.743,00:00:02.258,,I feel like they're going to use this data and be like,
00:48:30.000,00:48:38.310,00:00:08.310,,so a lot of the students did them all exactly because they also because we put two thirteen years olds who wouldn't do work in a group,
00:48:38.310,00:48:44.486,00:00:06.176,,and it didn't go over well because there's a problem if you invented an app the kids would probably become friends,
00:48:46.671,00:48:46.880,00:00:00.209,,,yeah
00:48:47.932,00:48:49.540,00:00:01.608,,I mean that's true,
00:48:49.594,00:48:50.911,00:00:01.317,,,okay so we have ten minutes
00:48:50.911,00:48:52.528,00:00:01.617,,,we have to kill ten minutes
00:48:52.558,00:48:55.182,00:00:02.624,,,and then we can be free from this math do
00:48:55.182,00:48:57.716,00:00:02.534,,oh no they're going to make us do that survey again right,
00:48:58.454,00:48:58.564,00:00:00.110,,,oh
00:48:59.442,00:49:09.810,00:00:10.368,,ninety-two minus twenty seven is sixty-four plus nine over two x plus nine equals two x plus nine,
00:49:09.810,00:49:11.500,00:00:01.690,,and then the answer is seven,
00:49:11.694,00:49:13.148,00:00:01.454,,I'm guessing x is seven,
00:49:13.162,00:49:14.202,00:00:01.040,,and I'm probably right yikes,
00:49:16.403,00:49:18.359,00:00:01.956,,,I have no idea what you can (inaudible)
00:49:18.359,00:49:21.242,00:00:02.883,,,it's going to make assume it's right
00:49:21.242,00:49:23.966,00:00:02.724,,everything I do is definitely right,
00:49:26.189,00:49:28.351,00:00:02.162,,my shirt is like a (inaudible) on the inside,
00:49:28.351,00:49:30.716,00:00:02.365,,and then just like wonderful sleeve,

00:50:47.826,00:50:50.865,00:00:03.039,,but I'm also really annoyed by the idea you know,
00:50:50.959,00:50:51.278,00:00:00.319,,,yeah
00:50:51.946,00:50:58.092,00:00:06.146,,because it's like I only did research on one part because I'm writing about Captain America for a mass section of it,
00:50:58.362,00:50:59.489,00:00:01.127,,,Captain America
00:51:00.178,00:51:02.594,00:00:02.416,,comic started in the fortys,
00:51:02.594,00:51:06.164,00:00:03.570,,and gave children help blah blah blah that definitely supports my thesis,
00:51:06.164,00:51:06.593,00:00:00.429,,,that's so cool
00:51:06.593,00:51:07.651,00:00:01.058,,blah blah blah (inaudible),
00:51:07.651,00:51:09.081,00:00:01.430,,blah blah blah (inaudible),I don't know that's cool
00:51:09.081,00:51:09.666,00:00:00.585,,,I don't know that's cool
00:51:09.756,00:51:11.986,00:00:02.230,,those cancel each other out,
00:51:12.716,00:51:15.500,00:00:02.784,,so then you don't have any xs so it's undefined,
00:51:17.243,00:51:19.554,00:00:02.311,,algebra yeah,
00:51:21.329,00:51:26.228,00:00:04.899,,and then I'm writing about portraits and political cartoons for the other two,
00:51:26.228,00:51:26.824,00:00:00.596,,and then I'm writing about portraits and political cartoons for the other two,oh that's sounds interesting
00:51:26.824,00:51:28.493,00:00:01.669,,,oh that's sounds interesting
00:51:29.081,00:51:30.946,00:00:01.865,,that's probably going to end up a really long answer,
00:51:31.135,00:51:32.648,00:00:01.513,,I mean I don't hate writing essay,
00:51:32.648,00:51:34.067,00:00:01.419,,I just don't want to do the research part,
00:51:34.889,00:51:36.295,00:00:01.406,,like the last meeting,
00:51:36.295,00:51:37.692,00:00:01.397,,I'm a writing person,
00:51:37.692,00:51:38.860,00:00:01.168,,I'm not a math person,
00:51:40.466,00:51:44.547,00:00:04.081,,what kind of science do you take next year,
00:51:45.225,00:51:47.310,00:00:02.085,,,pause filler like physics or something
00:51:47.310,00:51:48.139,00:00:00.829,,I hate I hate it,pause filler like physics or something
00:51:48.139,00:51:50.523,00:00:02.384,,I hate I hate it,
00:51:51.878,00:51:52.756,00:00:00.878,,that's terrible,
00:51:52.798,00:51:56.370,00:00:03.572,,,I think like the first year of Winchester because now I was looking there for high school
00:51:56.729,00:51:59.563,00:00:02.834,,,we have to take physics as well the first year
00:51:59.563,00:52:00.820,00:00:01.257,,,or maybe it's biology
00:52:00.820,00:52:01.458,00:00:00.638,,,I'm not sure
00:52:01.458,00:52:03.486,00:00:02.028,,oh it's physics wait are you going there,
00:52:04.841,00:52:05.858,00:00:01.017,,,I was considering
00:52:05.858,00:52:07.878,00:00:02.020,,,but I think going Ellis
00:52:07.878,00:52:08.871,00:00:00.993,,did you get accepted at Winchester,but I think going Ellis
00:52:08.871,00:52:09.567,00:00:00.696,,did you get accepted at Winchester,
00:52:12.862,00:52:12.982,00:00:00.120,,,yeah
00:52:13.594,00:52:15.243,00:00:01.649,,but Ellis is all girls,
00:52:15.243,00:52:16.297,00:00:01.054,,that's sad,
00:52:16.354,00:52:19.148,00:00:02.794,,,I know I'm kind of not looking for it
00:52:19.148,00:52:21.852,00:00:02.704,,,but it's like a nice place I guess pause filler
00:52:23.027,00:52:31.939,00:00:08.912,,I mean I have quite here's the thing I have quite a few friends there because the thing about Ellis is really like very not rough,

00:53:13.265,00:53:17.346,00:00:04.081,,,I know I think it's like whenever you're a senior you don't have to wear uniform
00:53:17.720,00:53:20.360,00:00:02.640,,at Winchester it's like we have a dress code,
00:53:20.360,00:53:22.250,00:00:01.890,,but we don't care if you follow it,
00:53:22.614,00:53:24.659,00:00:02.045,,,yeah it's like get to those business casual
00:53:24.659,00:53:25.218,00:00:00.559,,,but I don't think any

00:53:46.610,00:53:49.134,00:00:02.524,,and I got yelled that it was a school colors it's like,
00:53:49.134,00:53:49.240,00:00:00.106,,and I got yelled that it was a school colors it's like,I see you don't have the uniform

00:54:00.920,00:54:02.840,00:00:01.920,,but nobody wear shorts really except the boys,
00:54:03.270,00:54:06.000,00:00:02.730,,and then we'd have to wear shoes as long as clothes are towed,
00:54:06.000,00:54:07.262,00:00:01.262,,and it doesn't matter what our socks are,
00:54:07.482,00:54:11.762,00:00:04.280,,so wear any solid-colored shirt colored shirt,
00:54:11.762,00:54:13.210,00:00:01.448,,and our sweatshirts have to say (inaudible),

00:54:15.244,00:54:15.590,00:00:00.346,,,that is kind of strict
00:54:15.590,00:54:17.310,00:00:01.720,,and sweaters they changed the rule every day,that is kind of strict
00:54:17.310,00:54:20.010,00:00:02.700,,and sweaters they changed the rule every day,
00:54:20.240,00:54:22.960,00:00:02.720,,some days are like oh it's okay that your sweater is multicolored,
00:54:22.960,00:54:24.922,00:00:01.962,,and somebody say like you have to take that up,
00:54:24.922,00:54:26.568,00:00:01.646,,or I'm giving you detention,
00:54:26.938,00:54:27.666,00:00:00.728,,,oh wow

00:54:32.170,00:54:33.350,00:00:01.180,,I would get yelled at,
00:54:33.872,00:54:34.660,00:00:00.788,,,that sucks

00:54:45.256,00:54:46.919,00:00:01.663,,I've never actually got detention,
00:54:46.932,00:54:51.094,00:00:04.162,,like I'm shocked that Winchester accepted me because I've gotten so many points,
00:54:51.189,00:54:52.560,00:00:01.371,,like I haven't gotten detention,
00:54:52.560,00:54:54.392,00:00:01.832,,but I got points which kind of lead up to detention,
00:54:54.986,00:55:02.432,00:00:07.446,,and I'm also bad and I get really bad grades so I don't understand how they will accept me,
00:55:03.944,00:55:04.327,00:00:00.383,,,yeah I might like after two years at Ellis my parents will like me switch schools
