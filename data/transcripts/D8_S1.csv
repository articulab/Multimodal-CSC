00:14:01.580,00:14:02.070,00:00:00.490,,,,"okay",,
00:14:06.400,00:14:16.000,00:00:09.600,,,,"so you pause filler what you're doing it's the same it's again probably pretty much the same thing as the one we did earlier it's just pause filler",,
00:14:17.600,00:14:18.600,00:00:01.000,,,,,"but it works",
00:14:19.000,00:14:24.800,00:00:05.800,,,,"yeah so really it doesn't matter where the k ends",,
00:14:24.800,00:14:28.000,00:00:03.200,,,,"it just matters where you pause filler",,
00:14:28.800,00:14:32.600,00:00:03.800,,,,"I mean you just want to have the k by itself on one side",,
00:14:34.200,00:14:40.900,00:00:06.700,,,,"and so what you want to try to do is you want to get",,
00:14:42.200,00:14:44.800,00:00:02.600,,,,"oops sorry you want to get this",,
00:14:44.900,00:14:49.200,00:00:04.300,,,,"oops you want to get this over here",,
00:14:50.300,00:14:54.300,00:00:04.000,,,,"and you want to get that fifteen over here",,
00:14:55.200,00:15:02.300,00:00:07.100,,,,"and so basically when you're working with these you want to pause filler you pause filler",,
00:15:02.300,00:15:07.400,00:00:05.100,,,,"it's kind of like an inverse operations inverse order of operations type of thing",,
00:15:07.400,00:15:13.700,00:00:06.300,,,,"so you want to do addition or subtraction first and then multiplication or division",,
00:15:15.500,00:15:21.300,00:00:05.800,,,,"so you're going to start with getting the twenty-two to the other side and then dividing by fifteen",,
00:15:37.000,00:15:39.900,00:00:02.900,,,,,"(inaudible) should just give us the (inaudible)",
00:15:41.200,00:15:45.600,00:00:04.400,,,,"yeah or maybe it's like some kind of test or something",,
00:15:45.600,00:15:50.600,00:00:05.000,,,,"okay so here we have a negative number here",,
00:15:51.400,00:15:53.700,00:00:02.300,,,,"so you want to add it",,
00:15:53.700,00:15:55.900,00:00:02.200,,,,"and then you have a multiplication",,
00:15:57.000,00:15:59.000,00:00:02.000,,,,"you want to give so multiply",,
00:15:59.000,00:16:03.900,00:00:04.900,,,,"so you want to divide it",,
00:16:06.600,00:16:11.300,00:00:04.700,,,,"and so this is first",,
00:16:11.300,00:16:12.900,00:00:01.600,,,,"and then this is second",,
00:16:41.700,00:16:43.700,00:00:02.000,,,,,"well it is making me mad",
00:16:47.100,00:16:51.400,00:00:04.300,,,,"yeah okay so let's do this together",,
00:16:51.400,00:16:54.500,00:00:03.100,,,,"so we have twenty-two and some negative",,
00:16:54.800,00:16:59.900,00:00:05.100,,,,"so we want to add twenty-two to both sides so",,
00:17:00.300,00:17:03.200,00:00:02.900,,,,"and that gets rid of this twenty-two",,
00:17:03.200,00:17:11.300,00:00:08.100,,,,"and that makes this sixty-two courtesy of this fifteen right here",,
00:17:12.300,00:17:14.400,00:00:02.100,,,,"and since it's multiplied b k",,
00:17:14.400,00:17:15.800,00:00:01.400,,,,"you want to divide it",,
00:17:17.000,00:17:22.200,00:00:05.200,,,,"so you divide sixty-two by fifteen",,
00:17:23.100,00:17:24.200,00:00:01.100,,,,"and that equals k",,
00:17:33.000,00:17:35.300,00:00:02.300,,,,,"what then k equals pause filler",
00:17:35.900,00:17:37.600,00:00:01.700,,,,"k equals sixty-two",,
00:17:37.600,00:17:44.200,00:00:06.600,,,,,"k equals sixty-two sixty-two divided by five is like four",
00:17:45.000,00:17:46.400,00:00:01.400,,,,"it's divided by fifteen",,
00:17:46.400,00:17:49.600,00:00:03.200,,,,"and it's about four yeah",,
00:17:50.500,00:17:51.300,00:00:00.800,,,,"so that's good",,
00:17:51.400,00:17:55.400,00:00:04.000,,,,"it's four and two fifteens okay so next question",,
00:17:58.000,00:17:58.510,00:00:00.510,,,,"okay",,
00:18:00.500,00:18:02.900,00:00:02.400,,,,"this one is also pretty easy",,
00:18:03.000,00:18:05.230,00:00:02.230,,,,"so that's one of the easier ones",,
00:18:13.600,00:18:14.500,00:00:00.900,,,,,"there's three",
00:18:15.100,00:18:15.700,00:00:00.600,,,,"what",,
00:18:15.900,00:18:16.500,00:00:00.600,,,,,"three",
00:18:16.800,00:18:18.700,00:00:01.900,,,,"yeah awesome",,
00:18:23.200,00:18:23.900,00:00:00.700,,,,"great",,
00:18:25.700,00:18:27.440,00:00:01.740,,,,"next question okay",,
00:18:29.800,00:18:30.700,00:00:00.900,,,,"that is",,
00:18:30.700,00:18:31.500,00:00:00.800,,,,,"three again",
00:18:31.800,00:18:33.300,00:00:01.500,,,,"three yeah well",,
00:18:39.200,00:18:40.100,00:00:00.900,,,,"great okay",,
00:18:43.400,00:18:46.000,00:00:02.600,,,,"question is okay",,
00:18:47.700,00:18:50.800,00:00:03.100,,,,"so you have k on both sides",,
00:18:50.800,00:18:55.100,00:00:04.300,,,,"so you want to get both of the Ks just to one side",,
00:18:55.600,00:18:58.300,00:00:02.700,,,,"and since you have more Ks over here",,
00:18:58.300,00:19:00.700,00:00:02.400,,,,"you want to get rid of this k",,
00:19:01.800,00:19:05.600,00:00:03.800,,,,"so since if there's no positive or negative sign next to it",,
00:19:05.600,00:19:07.800,00:00:02.200,,,,"that means it's positive",,
00:19:09.200,00:19:12.100,00:00:02.900,,,,"so you would subtract k from both sides",,
00:19:13.500,00:19:20.900,00:00:07.400,,,,"and so you would have negative ten equals seven k minus sixty-eight",,
00:19:21.200,00:19:23.700,00:00:02.500,,,,"and then can you work out from there",,
00:19:24.000,00:19:24.900,00:00:00.900,,,,,"um hmm",
00:19:41.300,00:19:43.090,00:00:01.790,,,,,"like add something",
00:19:43.400,00:19:45.500,00:00:02.100,,,,"okay so let's close it",,
00:19:45.700,00:19:49.900,00:00:04.200,,,,"so this is negative",,
00:19:50.000,00:19:51.600,00:00:01.600,,,,"we want to add it to both sides",,
00:19:51.600,00:19:52.800,00:00:01.200,,,,"so since this is",,
00:19:53.200,00:19:55.500,00:00:02.300,,,,"so you add sixty-eight to both sides",,
00:19:56.400,00:19:59.100,00:00:02.700,,,,"and so you have negative ten on this side",,
00:20:00.000,00:20:04.800,00:00:04.800,,,,"so that's basically saying sixty-eight plus negative ten is also right",,
00:20:05.600,00:20:11.000,00:00:05.400,,,,"yeah sixty-eight minus ten is negative ten plus sixty-eight",,
00:20:11.200,00:20:21.100,00:00:09.900,,,,"so you have sixty-eight minus ten equals seven k",,
00:20:22.200,00:20:29.200,00:00:07.000,,,,"and so you have fifty-eight equals seven k",,
00:20:30.100,00:20:32.100,00:00:02.000,,,,"so can you do that",,
00:20:32.660,00:20:33.150,00:00:00.490,,,,,"mm-hmm",
00:20:34.900,00:20:36.600,00:00:01.700,,,,,"so fifty-eight minus seven k",
00:20:37.800,00:20:39.700,00:00:01.900,,,,"fifty-eight equals seven k",,
00:20:39.800,00:20:41.120,00:00:01.320,,,,"so my handwriting is terrible",,
00:20:49.600,00:20:51.000,00:00:01.400,,,,,"four something",
00:21:15.000,00:21:17.400,00:00:02.400,,,,,"oh that equals",
00:21:19.100,00:21:21.900,00:00:02.800,,,,,"I think it's like eight around eight",
00:21:21.000,00:21:21.550,00:00:00.550,,,,"yup",,
00:21:22.200,00:21:23.700,00:00:01.500,,,,"yeah that's exactly eight",,
00:21:28.300,00:21:29.200,00:00:00.900,,,,"awesome",,
00:21:30.100,00:21:33.400,00:00:03.300,,,,"so that is ten questions",,
00:21:35.700,00:21:36.990,00:00:01.290,,,,"so there we go",,
00:21:41.000,00:21:41.900,00:00:00.900,,,,"awesome",,
00:21:44.000,00:21:46.200,00:00:02.200,,,,"so now we kind of just wait",,
00:21:47.700,00:21:51.990,00:00:04.290,,,,,"do you have another tab open as Scribbler over",
00:21:52.500,00:21:53.000,00:00:00.500,,,,"yeah",,
00:21:53.100,00:21:55.700,00:00:02.600,,,,,"I think that one we're supposed to do next",
00:21:57.800,00:22:00.300,00:00:02.500,,,,"all right I don't know",,
00:22:00.300,00:22:03.230,00:00:02.930,,,,"they just told me to go to eleven and then stop",,
00:22:03.230,00:22:06.870,00:00:03.640,,,,"so who knows",,
00:22:11.000,00:22:14.100,00:00:03.100,,,,"maybe for someone else there another time",,
00:22:38.900,00:22:40.800,00:00:01.900,,,,"or maybe we're supposed to",,
00:22:41.200,00:22:46.430,00:00:05.230,,,,"actually I think we're supposed to come out and actually get them",,
00:22:47.600,00:22:48.700,00:00:01.100,,,,,"okay",
00:22:49.700,00:23:33.800,00:00:44.100,,,,,,"good job so you unlocked the pause filler bonus stage who just like (inaudible)"
00:23:33.900,00:23:35.300,00:00:01.400,,,"so can we have more (inaudible)",,,
00:23:35.300,00:23:48.600,00:00:13.300,,,"okay let me just get to the oh yeah okay",,,
00:23:48.700,00:23:52.700,00:00:04.000,,,"so I think the additional ones are only going up to twenty-four",,,
00:23:50.300,00:23:52.700,00:00:02.400,,,,"so are we going up to twenty-four",,
00:23:55.000,00:23:55.800,00:00:00.800,,,,"okay",,
00:23:55.100,00:24:10.400,00:00:15.300,,,"okay in this (inaudible) on here like this one is just going to be a little bit difficult so then also like the answering guide",,,
00:24:10.400,00:24:13.800,00:00:03.400,,,"just do those doable and (inaudible)",,,
00:24:16.000,00:24:21.300,00:00:05.300,,,,"all right so we have another ten questions to do",,
00:24:21.500,00:24:23.800,00:00:02.300,,,,,"yeah I want to switch to this computer",
00:24:25.600,00:24:26.550,00:00:00.950,,,,"yeah okay",,
00:24:26.700,00:24:27.560,00:00:00.860,,,,,"how to do that",
00:24:28.100,00:24:29.500,00:00:01.400,,,,,"oh one second",
00:25:56.230,00:25:57.700,00:00:01.470,,,,,"I don't know why we're kind of through this",
00:25:58.300,00:26:06.800,00:00:08.500,,,,"all right so do you want to start working on this",,
00:26:09.500,00:26:10.120,00:00:00.620,,,,,"yeah",
00:26:10.700,00:26:11.700,00:00:01.000,,,,"so let's just",,
00:26:16.900,00:26:19.000,00:00:02.100,,,,"we should remember what our signs are",,
00:26:19.500,00:26:20.600,00:00:01.100,,,,"this is the negative",,
00:26:20.600,00:26:21.700,00:00:01.100,,,,"this is the negative",,
00:26:22.200,00:26:23.600,00:00:01.400,,,,"this is the positive",,
00:26:24.000,00:26:24.800,00:00:00.800,,,,"that's a positive",,
00:26:24.800,00:26:27.000,00:00:02.200,,,,"so you can try to do that",,
00:26:42.000,00:26:42.540,00:00:00.540,,,,"oh",,
00:26:43.100,00:26:44.600,00:00:01.500,,,,,"oh my gosh this mouse (inaudible)",
00:26:46.000,00:26:48.600,00:00:02.600,,,,"okay wait don't press the wrong button",,
00:26:50.000,00:26:53.000,00:00:03.000,,,,"let's go there there okay",,
00:27:02.000,00:27:03.400,00:00:01.400,,,,,"I don't know none of this",
00:27:03.900,00:27:11.300,00:00:07.400,,,,"okay so here so you want to get the r on just one side",,
00:27:11.600,00:27:14.300,00:00:02.700,,,,"so since you have less r on here",,
00:27:14.300,00:27:15.000,00:00:00.700,,,,"you just have one r",,
00:27:15.000,00:27:17.000,00:00:02.000,,,,"so you subtract r from this side",,
00:27:18.700,00:27:20.000,00:00:01.300,,,,"and subtract r from that side",,
00:27:20.000,00:27:24.200,00:00:04.200,,,,"and you have negative thirty-three equals r",,
00:27:24.200,00:27:26.000,00:00:01.800,,,,"because you subtract to one",,
00:27:26.400,00:27:29.800,00:00:03.400,,,,,,"so that's it for this half"
00:27:27.400,00:27:29.380,00:00:01.980,,,,,"for this half for what",
00:27:30.700,00:27:35.600,00:00:04.900,,,,,,"pause filler the study so pause filler you're finished being tutored"
00:27:35.600,00:27:37.200,00:00:01.600,,,,,,"we're going to take a little bit of a break"
00:27:37.500,00:27:39.500,00:00:02.000,,,,,,"you guys stay on the line"
00:27:39.500,00:27:41.000,00:00:01.500,,,,,,"hang out and talk"

00:27:43.700,00:27:46.200,00:00:02.500,,,,,,"pause filler yeah take five minutes"
00:27:46.200,00:27:48.200,00:00:02.000,,,,,,"relax and then talk"
00:27:48.200,00:27:50.000,00:00:01.800,,,,,,"and then you guys switch"
00:27:50.000,00:27:50.800,00:00:00.800,,,,,,"and then we'll do that"
00:27:50.800,00:27:53.200,00:00:02.400,,,"and so you're going to be tutored for this one",,,
00:27:53.200,00:27:57.900,00:00:04.700,,,"you're writing in green text before correct",,,
00:27:56.200,00:27:56.800,00:00:00.600,,,,"yeah",,
00:27:58.000,00:28:01.400,00:00:03.400,,,"okay so you'll be writing in black text now",,,
00:27:58.200,00:27:59.200,00:00:01.000,,,,"yeah",,
