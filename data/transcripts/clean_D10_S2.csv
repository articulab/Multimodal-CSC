88,10,2,00:03:41.836,00:03:43.346,00:00:01.510,,but I don't think it's right
89,10,2,00:03:43.346,00:03:45.670,00:00:02.324,,because we're supposed to start at seventy thirty

95,10,2,00:03:55.634,00:03:57.094,00:00:01.460,like I'm guessing they're not right,
96,10,2,00:03:57.094,00:03:58.191,00:00:01.097,because they're different,
97,10,2,00:03:58.191,00:03:58.870,00:00:00.679,maybe one is right,
98,10,2,00:03:59.890,00:04:01.823,00:00:01.933,but I don't think it's eight yet,

104,10,2,00:04:10.177,00:04:11.094,00:00:00.917,that might be right,
105,10,2,00:04:11.207,00:04:12.476,00:00:01.269,mine says seven twenty-four,
106,10,2,00:04:13.869,00:04:14.369,00:00:00.500,,I don't know

143,10,2,00:05:38.346,00:05:41.304,00:00:02.958,,because I've been in case ever for like three years
144,10,2,00:05:41.681,00:05:46.307,00:00:04.626,,I've had the full computer in those three years which is the same computer
145,10,2,00:05:46.466,00:05:46.768,00:00:00.302,yeah,
146,10,2,00:05:48.203,00:05:50.266,00:00:02.063,you've gone through a lot less computers than I have,
147,10,2,00:05:50.266,00:05:54.128,00:00:03.862,,yeah well like I think I've broken one
148,10,2,00:05:54.826,00:05:55.449,00:00:00.623,,I broken it
149,10,2,00:05:55.449,00:05:57.452,00:00:02.003,,and I sent it to get them fixed or
150,10,2,00:05:58.784,00:06:00.784,00:00:02.000,,I've to use my sister's
151,10,2,00:06:00.913,00:06:03.575,00:00:02.662,,but it's obviously like the same type of computer
152,10,2,00:06:04.013,00:06:05.991,00:00:01.978,,I know right now they have the bigger ones
153,10,2,00:06:05.991,00:06:08.689,00:00:02.698,,is yours like smaller than usual
154,10,2,00:06:09.855,00:06:10.762,00:00:00.907,(pause filler),
155,10,2,00:06:09.918,00:06:11.827,00:00:01.909,,or is it normal size
156,10,2,00:06:12.005,00:06:12.863,00:00:00.858,I don't know,
157,10,2,00:06:13.530,00:06:17.821,00:00:04.291,out of all the laptops I've had probably like the third biggest,
158,10,2,00:06:18.416,00:06:21.175,00:00:02.759,,yeah mine is like really small
159,10,2,00:06:22.402,00:06:22.829,00:00:00.427,,like is
160,10,2,00:06:23.824,00:06:26.385,00:00:02.561,,it's probably even smaller than this cad thing
161,10,2,00:06:27.555,00:06:29.307,00:00:01.752,yeah you must have the same one as my sister then,
162,10,2,00:06:29.307,00:06:31.872,00:00:02.565,because my sister has like the older and half the size of this,
163,10,2,00:06:31.997,00:06:34.875,00:00:02.878,,yeah I don't know why they make it so small
164,10,2,00:06:35.114,00:06:38.022,00:00:02.908,,but it's probably because when I type on that computer
165,10,2,00:06:38.055,00:06:40.698,00:00:02.643,,and then I type on a bigger computer and
166,10,2,00:06:40.301,00:06:41.209,00:00:00.908,and like way (inaudible),
167,10,2,00:06:40.698,00:06:43.695,00:00:02.997,,I yeah and I always mistype
168,10,2,00:06:43.810,00:06:47.430,00:00:03.620,,because my hands are so used to typing on a smaller ones
169,10,2,00:06:47.432,00:06:50.407,00:00:02.975,,when it's bigger it's like throws everything off
170,10,2,00:06:51.215,00:06:59.946,00:00:08.731,,and so there's always typos sort of like change to do stuff on my sister's computer any computer that's normal sized
171,10,2,00:07:00.397,00:07:04.220,00:00:03.823,yeah and I am pretty bad at typing anyway so,
172,10,2,00:07:04.369,00:07:04.877,00:00:00.508,(laughter),
173,10,2,00:07:05.103,00:07:06.583,00:00:01.480,,I used to be horrible at typing
174,10,2,00:07:06.969,00:07:10.580,00:00:03.611,,and then I think just from doing cyber school I got better at it
175,10,2,00:07:10.734,00:07:12.187,00:00:01.453,,I'm not going to say I'm fast
176,10,2,00:07:12.226,00:07:15.762,00:00:03.536,,but I can do it better than I could three years ago
177,10,2,00:07:17.678,00:07:20.491,00:00:02.813,yeah I'm pretty slow at it (laughter),
178,10,2,00:07:23.519,00:07:25.650,00:00:02.131,,but it's better than my handwriting
179,10,2,00:07:25.650,00:07:26.818,00:00:01.168,,and everything is all perfect
180,10,2,00:07:26.541,00:07:27.039,00:00:00.498,(laughter),
181,10,2,00:07:27.037,00:07:31.125,00:00:04.088,,so I would prefer than to writing on paper
182,10,2,00:07:49.895,00:07:50.224,00:00:00.329,,okay
183,10,2,00:07:52.708,00:07:53.297,00:00:00.589,,wait what (inaudible)
184,10,2,00:08:19.562,00:08:20.859,00:00:01.297,,we have twenty minutes all the way
185,10,2,00:08:21.406,00:08:22.492,00:00:01.086,,because we have two different times
186,10,2,00:08:22.492,00:08:23.703,00:00:01.211,,we're trying to figure out which one is correct
187,10,2,00:08:25.663,00:08:27.312,00:00:01.649,that's mine,
188,10,2,00:08:27.203,00:08:28.390,00:00:01.187,,I got eight ���o seven
189,10,2,00:08:29.992,00:08:32.156,00:00:02.164,well what did I say eight o seven,
190,10,2,00:08:35.117,00:08:35.726,00:00:00.609,yeah,
191,10,2,00:08:35.156,00:08:35.632,00:00:00.476,,very
192,10,2,00:08:41.048,00:08:42.335,00:00:01.287,,just ask me for the time
193,10,2,00:08:42.335,00:08:44.261,00:00:01.926,,and I'll tell you what's the time
194,10,2,00:08:51.046,00:08:53.796,00:00:02.750,,oh twenty minutes really
195,10,2,00:08:53.835,00:08:56.273,00:00:02.438,I know right I know (inaudible),
196,10,2,00:08:57.082,00:09:01.992,00:00:04.910,,okay so this isn't anything new I don't think
197,10,2,00:09:02.398,00:09:02.843,00:00:00.445,nope,
198,10,2,00:09:04.679,00:09:06.679,00:00:02.000,,I'm going to draw the line
199,10,2,00:09:06.680,00:09:09.226,00:00:02.546,,because that helps me for some reason
200,10,2,00:09:09.335,00:09:16.703,00:00:07.368,,I'm guessing I'm supposed to subtract x
201,10,2,00:09:17.499,00:09:19.929,00:00:02.430,,because that's what the papers were saying
202,10,2,00:09:20.640,00:09:21.179,00:00:00.539,it's that,
203,10,2,00:09:20.726,00:09:23.502,00:00:02.776,,is that correct because no
204,10,2,00:09:23.502,00:09:25.058,00:00:01.556,,no I'm supposed to divide x
205,10,2,00:09:25.677,00:09:27.156,00:00:01.479,,I'm not sure one minute
206,10,2,00:09:27.156,00:09:27.912,00:00:00.756,,let me think
207,10,2,00:09:30.418,00:09:37.421,00:00:07.003,,pause filler yeah yeah
208,10,2,00:09:37.421,00:09:40.820,00:00:03.399,,and just make this forty over x
209,10,2,00:09:45.479,00:09:45.952,00:00:00.473,cool,
210,10,2,00:09:48.486,00:09:49.872,00:00:01.386,,okay this might be right
211,10,2,00:09:49.872,00:10:01.236,00:00:11.364,,so then if I did that I have eight over seven equals forty oops
212,10,2,00:10:01.236,00:10:04.189,00:00:02.953,,oops I clicked the find okay
213,10,2,00:10:04.959,00:10:06.105,00:00:01.146,not that button,
214,10,2,00:10:07.783,00:10:08.587,00:00:00.804,,I wish it was red
215,10,2,00:10:08.709,00:10:12.614,00:00:03.905,,and then it can say don't click the red button
216,10,2,00:10:12.309,00:10:13.033,00:00:00.724,(laughter),
217,10,2,00:10:15.094,00:10:19.641,00:00:04.547,,okay does that make any sense I think
218,10,2,00:10:19.297,00:10:20.522,00:00:01.225,I think so,
219,10,2,00:10:21.297,00:10:21.610,00:00:00.313,,I think
220,10,2,00:10:21.513,00:10:24.842,00:00:03.329,pause filler maybe we're using cross products,
221,10,2,00:10:24.842,00:10:28.444,00:00:03.602,where like it go seven times forty and three times x equals,
222,10,2,00:10:27.466,00:10:31.749,00:00:04.283,,oh you could do that or you could just
223,10,2,00:10:34.061,00:10:35.432,00:00:01.371,,I think I did that wrong
224,10,2,00:10:36.356,00:10:36.845,00:00:00.489,,what do you think
225,10,2,00:10:36.845,00:10:38.252,00:00:01.407,,because I think I did that wrong
226,10,2,00:10:38.751,00:10:41.165,00:00:02.414,pause filler when I learned it it was set up this way,
227,10,2,00:10:41.165,00:10:42.432,00:00:01.267,but we used cross products,
228,10,2,00:10:42.432,00:10:45.934,00:00:03.502,so it would be forty times seven and forty times x,
229,10,2,00:10:46.344,00:10:46.613,00:00:00.269,,okay
230,10,2,00:10:47.783,00:10:51.999,00:00:04.216,but it's not about how I learned it so no promises (laughter),
231,10,2,00:10:51.993,00:11:08.812,00:00:16.819,,so forty times does that mean just got to cross that out
232,10,2,00:11:09.261,00:11:19.357,00:00:10.096,or maybe we're supposed to multiply both the sides by the thing worth writing so like three seven times three seven and forty time three seventh,
233,10,2,00:11:19.937,00:11:21.933,00:00:01.996,,yeah that might make sense
234,10,2,00:11:22.567,00:11:25.439,00:00:02.872,,but like that's doing the same thing right
235,10,2,00:11:25.594,00:11:26.722,00:00:01.128,yeah pretty much,
236,10,2,00:11:27.560,00:11:34.824,00:00:07.264,,okay I'm going to try this so forty times seven
237,10,2,00:11:34.824,00:11:37.432,00:00:02.608,,how come I don't have that memorized
238,10,2,00:11:37.289,00:11:37.973,00:00:00.684,I don't know,
239,10,2,00:11:38.315,00:11:40.289,00:00:01.974,,let's do it in my head
240,10,2,00:11:51.520,00:11:53.506,00:00:01.986,,would that be two hundred and eighty
241,10,2,00:11:54.288,00:11:55.247,00:00:00.959,,that's what I got
242,10,2,00:11:58.164,00:12:01.391,00:00:03.227,yeah two eighty,
243,10,2,00:12:02.237,00:12:06.262,00:00:04.025,,two eighty that way right that's the top or the bottom
244,10,2,00:12:06.282,00:12:07.190,00:00:00.908,,I think that's the top
245,10,2,00:12:07.557,00:12:09.435,00:00:01.878,top because forty times seven,
246,10,2,00:12:09.435,00:12:12.378,00:00:02.943,,yeah over a three x then
247,10,2,00:12:12.837,00:12:13.046,00:00:00.209,yeah,
248,10,2,00:12:18.646,00:12:29.734,00:00:11.088,,and then I'm confused
249,10,2,00:12:29.741,00:12:41.761,00:00:12.020,,because it's supposed to say like in the format of this equals like constant constant constant equals variable or something like that
250,10,2,00:12:42.629,00:12:44.612,00:00:01.983,,so now it's just fraction
251,10,2,00:12:46.966,00:12:48.845,00:00:01.879,,oh well I'll see
252,10,2,00:12:48.891,00:12:51.759,00:00:02.868,,maybe I'll get the right answer and just be doing it the wrong way
253,10,2,00:12:52.238,00:12:52.891,00:00:00.653,(laughter),
254,10,2,00:12:58.981,00:13:05.635,00:00:06.654,,so try to get rid of yeah see
255,10,2,00:13:03.013,00:13:07.433,00:00:04.420,I'm looking at it,
256,10,2,00:13:05.644,00:13:07.074,00:00:01.430,,now this is all messed up
257,10,2,00:13:08.627,00:13:10.355,00:00:01.728,(pause filler) I'm looking at-,
258,10,2,00:13:10.411,00:13:10.965,00:00:00.554,I'm not quite sure,
259,10,2,00:13:11.075,00:13:12.382,00:00:01.307,I never learned about this one,
260,10,2,00:13:12.581,00:13:17.670,00:00:05.089,,yeah okay maybe I should try it a different way
261,10,2,00:13:17.670,00:13:20.344,00:00:02.674,,and then if it doesn't work I'll come back to it
262,10,2,00:13:20.413,00:13:25.299,00:00:04.886,it sounds like a hundred equals the fraction with a number (inaudible),
263,10,2,00:13:25.542,00:13:27.896,00:00:02.354,so it says to go like first,
264,10,2,00:13:27.896,00:13:30.211,00:00:02.315,it would be forty times thirty-seven,
265,10,2,00:13:30.211,00:13:32.007,00:00:01.796,and then that's the answer,
266,10,2,00:13:33.234,00:13:36.846,00:00:03.612,,forty times what
267,10,2,00:13:35.037,00:13:36.691,00:00:01.654,thirty-seven so,
268,10,2,00:13:37.196,00:13:42.261,00:00:05.065,,okay how would you do that
269,10,2,00:13:42.673,00:13:46.037,00:00:03.364,I think we might have to set up a forty as a fraction,
270,10,2,00:13:46.614,00:13:51.323,00:00:04.709,so maybe we could put it over one forty over one times,
271,10,2,00:13:49.299,00:13:51.224,00:00:01.925,,yeah that makes sense
272,10,2,00:13:52.084,00:13:52.588,00:00:00.504,yeah,
273,10,2,00:13:52.542,00:13:54.616,00:00:02.074,,three that's a bad three
274,10,2,00:13:54.616,00:13:56.037,00:00:01.421,,but at least I know it's a three
275,10,2,00:13:56.392,00:13:58.626,00:00:02.234,yeah it's a three (laughter),
276,10,2,00:13:58.357,00:14:06.446,00:00:08.089,,okay times forty over one
277,10,2,00:14:12.315,00:14:15.538,00:00:03.223,so let me find the common denominator and all that,
278,10,2,00:14:16.246,00:14:25.674,00:00:09.428,,or wait can I just do this no can I no
279,10,2,00:14:25.674,00:14:29.102,00:00:03.428,,I don't- I think we're multiplying 
280,10,2,00:14:29.102,00:14:30.974,00:00:01.872,,can you just go straight across
281,10,2,00:14:31.675,00:14:32.662,00:00:00.987,I think so yeah,
282,10,2,00:14:33.948,00:14:35.649,00:00:01.701,,yeah it's adding and subtracting
283,10,2,00:14:35.649,00:14:37.090,00:00:01.441,,but you have to find the common denominator I think
284,10,2,00:14:37.688,00:14:38.584,00:00:00.896,yeah I think so,
285,10,2,00:14:38.584,00:14:39.688,00:00:01.104,I'm not sure,
286,10,2,00:14:39.974,00:14:41.259,00:00:01.285,it looks so weird (laughter),
287,10,2,00:14:40.362,00:14:41.233,00:00:00.871,,and then
288,10,2,00:14:41.477,00:14:42.477,00:00:01.000,(laughter),
289,10,2,00:14:42.784,00:14:43.506,00:00:00.722,,(laughter)
290,10,2,00:14:43.311,00:14:44.467,00:00:01.156,this is like yeah,
291,10,2,00:14:44.553,00:14:45.155,00:00:00.602,(laughter),
292,10,2,00:14:44.623,00:14:52.103,00:00:07.480,,(inaudible) so it would be one twenty
293,10,2,00:14:53.168,00:14:58.246,00:00:05.078,one twenty over one or one twenty and ten also I think we got it (laughter),
294,10,2,00:14:57.311,00:15:01.285,00:00:03.974,,yeah so we have one twenty over seven
295,10,2,00:15:03.051,00:15:09.007,00:00:05.956,,we do have to simplify that over one or wait divide it
296,10,2,00:15:11.168,00:15:12.662,00:00:01.494,one twenty divided by seven,
297,10,2,00:15:15.467,00:15:21.038,00:00:05.571,,seven goes into twelve one time
298,10,2,00:15:21.648,00:15:31.013,00:00:09.365,,one times seven is seven minus
299,10,2,00:15:37.454,00:15:56.649,00:00:19.195,,wait I'm confused now yeah okay yeah and then
300,10,2,00:15:58.311,00:15:59.029,00:00:00.718,,oh
301,10,2,00:15:59.029,00:16:08.090,00:00:09.061,,I haven't done long division too long too long spent long so five
302,10,2,00:16:01.594,00:16:02.594,00:00:01.000,and forever,
303,10,2,00:16:03.454,00:16:04.064,00:00:00.610,yeah,
304,10,2,00:16:15.629,00:16:15.826,00:00:00.197,,I'm sorry
305,10,2,00:16:15.826,00:16:19.606,00:00:03.780,,I'm just like blanking out having a brain fart
306,10,2,00:16:17.883,00:16:18.645,00:00:00.762,I know right,
307,10,2,00:16:20.346,00:16:21.047,00:00:00.701,me too,
308,10,2,00:16:20.984,00:16:34.462,00:00:13.478,,okay so pause filler minus five oh yeah wait do seven times five oh yeah seven divide
309,10,2,00:16:34.462,00:16:38.118,00:00:03.656,,don't cancel you bring down zero right
310,10,2,00:16:38.543,00:16:40.527,00:00:01.984,,I didn't see how many times seven goes into fifty
311,10,2,00:16:40.708,00:16:41.519,00:00:00.811,yeah yeah,
312,10,2,00:16:41.087,00:16:43.421,00:00:02.334,,okay it's coming back
313,10,2,00:16:43.551,00:17:00.344,00:00:16.793,,seven goes into fifty oh seven goes into fifty seventy twenty-eight twenty-eight
314,10,2,00:17:16.655,00:17:22.459,00:00:05.804,oh my god it's going to be long (laughter) forty,
315,10,2,00:17:27.758,00:17:48.252,00:00:20.494,,forty-two okay pause filler forty-two forty-nine is one two three four five six seven
316,10,2,00:17:48.977,00:17:52.344,00:00:03.367,,I got seven times and forty-nine right
317,10,2,00:17:52.264,00:17:53.413,00:00:01.149,yeah yeah,
318,10,2,00:17:53.213,00:17:57.735,00:00:04.522,,okay so seven goes and fifty seven times seven
319,10,2,00:17:57.517,00:17:57.965,00:00:00.448,how did you get,
320,10,2,00:17:58.531,00:17:59.649,00:00:01.118,wait you have forty-nine,
321,10,2,00:18:00.092,00:18:00.540,00:00:00.448,,huh
322,10,2,00:18:01.218,00:18:02.000,00:00:00.782,because it will go,
323,10,2,00:18:02.034,00:18:03.590,00:00:01.556,,it goes into seven
324,10,2,00:18:03.590,00:18:07.528,00:00:03.938,,oh wait seven goes and fifty pause filler seven times
325,10,2,00:18:08.471,00:18:14.804,00:00:06.333,because with the seven fourteen twenty-one twenty-eight thirty-two or no no nothing I can remember,
326,10,2,00:18:14.924,00:18:16.344,00:00:01.420,no you're right (laughter),
327,10,2,00:18:16.379,00:18:19.124,00:00:02.745,I messed up my mind,
328,10,2,00:18:16.876,00:18:17.172,00:00:00.296,,(laughter)
329,10,2,00:18:18.839,00:18:21.344,00:00:02.505,,oh no can I scroll down or something
330,10,2,00:18:21.862,00:18:31.471,00:00:09.609,,I guess not fifty oh well forty-nine
331,10,2,00:18:22.069,00:18:24.988,00:00:02.919,I'm not sure,
332,10,2,00:18:32.023,00:18:34.482,00:00:02.459,we'll just go one twenty over seven (laughter),
333,10,2,00:18:33.241,00:18:39.034,00:00:05.793,,yeah can I scroll down for a while
334,10,2,00:18:39.138,00:18:40.955,00:00:01.817,,I'll just do up to this side
335,10,2,00:18:41.217,00:18:41.874,00:00:00.657,yeah,
336,10,2,00:18:47.724,00:18:51.004,00:00:03.280,,fifty minus nine is one
337,10,2,00:18:51.916,00:18:52.715,00:00:00.799,why,
338,10,2,00:18:52.797,00:18:54.077,00:00:01.280,,and what do you do
339,10,2,00:18:54.919,00:18:55.657,00:00:00.738,can I just say,
340,10,2,00:18:54.956,00:18:56.270,00:00:01.314,,can I just say r one
341,10,2,00:18:56.280,00:18:57.014,00:00:00.734,then you get a one,
342,10,2,00:18:57.024,00:18:58.385,00:00:01.361,and then you'd get another zero,
343,10,2,00:18:58.526,00:19:01.686,00:00:03.160,so you get ten one time,
344,10,2,00:18:59.321,00:18:59.806,00:00:00.485,,yeah
345,10,2,00:19:00.323,00:19:02.864,00:00:02.541,,so ten okay
346,10,2,00:19:03.386,00:19:04.841,00:00:01.455,this is a repeating process,
347,10,2,00:19:04.841,00:19:07.932,00:00:03.091,,I really need to scroll down scrolling
348,10,2,00:19:07.223,00:19:07.835,00:00:00.612,I know,
349,10,2,00:19:07.932,00:19:09.149,00:00:01.217,,there's a setting that says scrolling
350,10,2,00:19:09.700,00:19:11.642,00:00:01.942,this will just be pretty much,
351,10,2,00:19:11.927,00:19:13.719,00:00:01.792,but this will pretty much just be a repeating thing,
352,10,2,00:19:14.678,00:19:17.292,00:00:02.614,,yeah right one repeating seventeen
353,10,2,00:19:14.820,00:19:16.004,00:00:01.184,yeah,
354,10,2,00:19:17.292,00:19:19.560,00:00:02.268,so seventeen what's seventeen seventeen seventeen,
355,10,2,00:19:19.840,00:19:20.095,00:00:00.255,,yeah
356,10,2,00:19:20.725,00:19:21.732,00:00:01.007,so it will be a long decimal,
357,10,2,00:19:21.732,00:19:23.191,00:00:01.459,so just say seven,
358,10,2,00:19:22.800,00:19:25.067,00:00:02.267,,fifteen point one repeated right
359,10,2,00:19:25.188,00:19:25.425,00:00:00.237,yeah,
360,10,2,00:19:26.721,00:19:29.999,00:00:03.278,,one repeated so what was it
361,10,2,00:19:30.035,00:19:47.224,00:00:17.189,,the variable x equals pause filler seventeen point one p
362,10,2,00:19:32.093,00:19:32.717,00:00:00.624,yeah,
363,10,2,00:19:48.088,00:19:50.768,00:00:02.680,,encircle it so people know that's the very answer
364,10,2,00:19:51.609,00:19:53.248,00:00:01.639,,because everything else is a mess
365,10,2,00:19:53.428,00:19:54.002,00:00:00.574,yeah,
366,10,2,00:19:54.630,00:19:56.134,00:00:01.504,,that's it forever
367,10,2,00:19:56.134,00:19:56.753,00:00:00.619,,I'm sorry
368,10,2,00:19:56.483,00:19:57.753,00:00:01.270,next to go,
369,10,2,00:19:58.764,00:20:03.020,00:00:04.256,,finally again this is like same thing
370,10,2,00:20:04.299,00:20:05.328,00:00:01.029,,this wasn't on the paper
371,10,2,00:20:05.841,00:20:06.710,00:00:00.869,,I think it was on paper now
372,10,2,00:20:07.187,00:20:08.480,00:00:01.293,,it just didn't get far enough
373,10,2,00:20:09.980,00:20:13.576,00:00:03.596,,okay yeah except I don't have a paper
374,10,2,00:20:09.992,00:20:10.992,00:00:01.000,okay,
375,10,2,00:20:11.443,00:20:12.177,00:00:00.734,I don't know,
376,10,2,00:20:13.904,00:20:16.338,00:00:02.434,,okay so what does it say to do
377,10,2,00:20:14.704,00:20:15.110,00:00:00.406,yeah,
378,10,2,00:20:17.033,00:20:22.684,00:00:05.651,it says this one is a hundred equals two over three y,
379,10,2,00:20:23.091,00:20:28.658,00:00:05.567,so it says multiply both sides by three over two,
380,10,2,00:20:23.124,00:20:23.490,00:00:00.366,,okay
381,10,2,00:20:29.177,00:20:29.644,00:00:00.467,,okay
382,10,2,00:20:29.701,00:20:30.899,00:00:01.198,and then it gets a hundred and fifty,
383,10,2,00:20:31.572,00:20:34.990,00:00:03.418,,so multiply oh yeah that makes sense now okay
384,10,2,00:20:35.480,00:20:36.908,00:00:01.428,,because you're trying to get k
385,10,2,00:20:35.492,00:20:35.961,00:00:00.469,yeah,
386,10,2,00:20:36.908,00:20:39.451,00:00:02.543,,so we'll multiply why side by three over eight
387,10,2,00:20:39.971,00:20:45.971,00:00:06.000,because three over eight times three over eight we'll cross cancel that out so fourteen time three over eight,
388,10,2,00:20:43.454,00:20:43.927,00:00:00.473,,yeah
389,10,2,00:20:46.250,00:20:55.317,00:00:09.067,,so here I just got k and then oh three over eight and the answer
390,10,2,00:20:55.317,00:21:06.874,00:00:11.557,,this has been a b equal to k times fourteen over one equals
391,10,2,00:21:00.913,00:21:01.754,00:00:00.841,fourteen,
392,10,2,00:21:07.466,00:21:09.906,00:00:02.440,maybe I guess a lowest common denominator thing,
393,10,2,00:21:11.057,00:21:15.567,00:00:04.510,,maybe or you just got to like divide or something
394,10,2,00:21:16.124,00:21:18.198,00:00:02.074,because one could go into eight pretty easily,
395,10,2,00:21:18.198,00:21:20.722,00:00:02.524,so eight would be the lowest common denominator,
396,10,2,00:21:20.722,00:21:25.769,00:00:05.047,so it would be three over eight times fourteen over eight (inaudible),
397,10,2,00:21:21.317,00:21:21.711,00:00:00.394,,yeah
398,10,2,00:21:26.908,00:21:34.230,00:00:07.322,,okay three times fourteen twenty-eight thirty-two oh
399,10,2,00:21:36.366,00:21:37.274,00:00:00.908,,yeah
400,10,2,00:21:36.903,00:21:37.144,00:00:00.241,yeah,
401,10,2,00:21:38.826,00:21:39.802,00:00:00.976,I think so,
402,10,2,00:21:41.042,00:21:42.456,00:00:01.414,(laughter),
403,10,2,00:21:41.639,00:21:44.248,00:00:02.609,,okay I don't know why there's weird dots
404,10,2,00:21:44.398,00:21:47.668,00:00:03.270,,yeah I don't know why but okay
405,10,2,00:21:46.653,00:21:47.110,00:00:00.457,I don't know,
406,10,2,00:21:48.293,00:21:49.985,00:00:01.692,,okay I'm going to start y up here
407,10,2,00:21:52.024,00:21:53.033,00:00:01.009,in forty-two,
408,10,2,00:21:53.673,00:21:55.408,00:00:01.735,,forty or thirty
409,10,2,00:21:56.307,00:22:00.412,00:00:04.105,forty-two because it will be four plus four plus four equals twelve,
410,10,2,00:21:57.322,00:21:57.932,00:00:00.610,,fourty
411,10,2,00:22:00.412,00:22:01.798,00:00:01.386,so you carry a one,
412,10,2,00:22:06.086,00:22:08.024,00:00:01.938,,what's forty-two over eight
413,10,2,00:22:06.245,00:22:06.562,00:00:00.317,yeah,
414,10,2,00:22:08.461,00:22:08.745,00:00:00.284,yeah,
415,10,2,00:22:09.057,00:22:09.278,00:00:00.221,,okay
416,10,2,00:22:10.230,00:22:12.158,00:00:01.928,so then eight would go into forty-two,
417,10,2,00:22:42.167,00:22:44.457,00:00:02.290,,eight goes into forty-two what did you
418,10,2,00:22:58.023,00:22:58.495,00:00:00.472,you go first,
419,10,2,00:22:58.748,00:22:59.224,00:00:00.476,(laughter),
420,10,2,00:22:59.464,00:23:01.015,00:00:01.551,,oh I was going to ask if you bother anything
421,10,2,00:23:01.937,00:23:03.092,00:00:01.155,,because I'm still working on it
422,10,2,00:23:02.007,00:23:05.542,00:00:03.535,so eight and eight equals sixteen,
423,10,2,00:23:05.542,00:23:07.441,00:00:01.899,sixteen plus eight equals twenty-four,
424,10,2,00:23:07.441,00:23:09.775,00:00:02.334,twenty-four plus eight equals thirty-two,
425,10,2,00:23:09.775,00:23:11.992,00:00:02.217,so then thirty-two plus eight equals forty,
426,10,2,00:23:11.992,00:23:13.030,00:00:01.038,so you can get the forty,
427,10,2,00:23:13.263,00:23:13.628,00:00:00.365,,okay
428,10,2,00:23:15.031,00:23:18.779,00:00:03.748,so then it would be five times,
429,10,2,00:23:18.955,00:23:19.427,00:00:00.472,,five times
430,10,2,00:24:55.006,00:24:56.811,00:00:01.805,(laughter) I have no idea what to talk about,
431,10,2,00:24:57.257,00:24:59.949,00:00:02.692,,me neither wait what's the surgery called again
432,10,2,00:24:59.949,00:25:01.056,00:00:01.107,,I didn't hear you the first time
433,10,2,00:25:01.452,00:25:02.622,00:00:01.170,I don't know what's it called,
434,10,2,00:25:03.893,00:25:06.036,00:00:02.143,I guess that is called oral surgery,
435,10,2,00:25:06.036,00:25:06.899,00:00:00.863,because that's what it's considered,
436,10,2,00:25:08.075,00:25:10.723,00:00:02.648,,oh well like are they going to numb it
437,10,2,00:25:11.654,00:25:12.566,00:00:00.912,I'm not sure,
438,10,2,00:25:12.911,00:25:15.364,00:00:02.453,,I hope they do (inaudible)
439,10,2,00:25:15.452,00:25:17.409,00:00:01.957,two (inaudible) are cutting into me,
440,10,2,00:25:17.750,00:25:19.079,00:00:01.329,,yeah they possibly will
441,10,2,00:25:19.352,00:25:21.136,00:00:01.784,because my teeth are connected to the bones,
442,10,2,00:25:21.147,00:25:22.977,00:00:01.830,that kind of hurts,
443,10,2,00:25:22.533,00:25:27.852,00:00:05.319,,yeah that would it probably make you number
444,10,2,00:25:23.440,00:25:25.340,00:00:01.900,(laughter) (laughter),
445,10,2,00:25:28.102,00:25:28.704,00:00:00.602,,I don't know
446,10,2,00:25:29.114,00:25:31.791,00:00:02.677,,So I'm- so I'm
447,10,2,00:25:29.227,00:25:32.192,00:00:02.965,and just knock me out and just hit me in the heat with a hammer,
448,10,2,00:25:33.458,00:25:37.645,00:00:04.187,,I'm sure they'll do it in a much more sophisticated way
449,10,2,00:25:37.166,00:25:37.874,00:00:00.708,(laughter),
450,10,2,00:25:39.562,00:25:42.458,00:00:02.896,so I hope they don't just make me breath in the mask,
451,10,2,00:25:42.666,00:25:43.541,00:00:00.875,oh that scares me,
452,10,2,00:25:47.687,00:25:50.395,00:00:02.708,I'm so scared to walk in the world around you go dark,
453,10,2,00:25:50.520,00:25:55.958,00:00:05.438,,yeah like (inaudible) numb I think
454,10,2,00:25:55.312,00:25:57.645,00:00:02.333,I prefer being hit in the head,
455,10,2,00:25:57.562,00:25:58.187,00:00:00.625,,really
456,10,2,00:25:58.520,00:26:07.437,00:00:08.917,yes because I am terrified with needles and feeling of walking your surroundings with spade in and out so scary,
457,10,2,00:26:07.687,00:26:08.791,00:00:01.104,I'd rather wave in the head,
458,10,2,00:26:08.249,00:26:09.294,00:00:01.045,,just close your eyes
459,10,2,00:26:09.294,00:26:13.058,00:00:03.764,,and then do it so just like you're closing
460,10,2,00:26:12.338,00:26:13.117,00:00:00.779,but it gets hard to breath,
461,10,2,00:26:13.117,00:26:16.529,00:00:03.412,it feels like your entire body is just going numb,
462,10,2,00:26:16.573,00:26:19.264,00:00:02.691,it's (sfx) not fun,

464,10,2,00:26:23.705,00:26:25.132,00:00:01.427,I'm just terrified of surgery,
465,10,2,00:26:25.161,00:26:26.703,00:00:01.542,because I had a bad surgery before,
466,10,2,00:26:26.703,00:26:27.703,00:00:01.000,so this will be fun,

474,10,2,00:26:44.906,00:26:47.828,00:00:02.922,,I don't think I've ever had surgery
475,10,2,00:26:49.072,00:26:51.350,00:00:02.278,,but my sister has

484,10,2,00:27:10.247,00:27:11.742,00:00:01.495,,we were the first owner
485,10,2,00:27:12.144,00:27:16.133,00:00:03.989,,but she lied because the dog had had an owner before that
486,10,2,00:27:17.010,00:27:21.680,00:00:04.670,,and pause filler she had her leg I think yeah

488,10,2,00:27:25.092,00:27:27.845,00:00:02.753,,and the breeder tried to just put a cast on it
489,10,2,00:27:28.082,00:27:29.154,00:00:01.072,,and she did it wrong
490,10,2,00:27:29.216,00:27:31.360,00:00:02.144,,and so the bone like healed the wrong way
491,10,2,00:27:31.834,00:27:39.154,00:00:07.320,,and so yeah so pause filler my dog has to like get a surgery and like it had to fix it
492,10,2,00:27:31.901,00:27:32.505,00:00:00.604,(laughter),

498,10,2,00:27:53.010,00:27:54.474,00:00:01.464,it's pretty much something in the intestines,
499,10,2,00:27:54.474,00:27:58.391,00:00:03.917,so she had to get part of her intestine taken out taken,
500,10,2,00:27:58.082,00:27:58.639,00:00:00.557,,how long

508,10,2,00:28:28.373,00:28:29.844,00:00:01.471,,the weird thing though was like
509,10,2,00:28:29.896,00:28:32.610,00:00:02.714,,I've never seen a dog with a cast
510,10,2,00:28:32.791,00:28:33.545,00:00:00.754,(laughter),

567,10,2,00:33:26.944,00:33:29.268,00:00:02.324,,I think but either way
568,10,2,00:33:30.424,00:33:32.206,00:00:01.782,,I think you set the answer

574,10,2,00:33:42.659,00:33:48.564,00:00:05.905,,and you can check and see if you get the same answer if you pause filler do the fractions
575,10,2,00:33:53.117,00:33:54.675,00:00:01.558,,oh my god
576,10,2,00:33:59.441,00:34:01.066,00:00:01.625,that's not a one,

582,10,2,00:34:08.971,00:34:11.541,00:00:02.570,mine is thumbs minus up,
583,10,2,00:34:11.552,00:34:13.469,00:00:01.917,I don't know with that (laughter),
584,10,2,00:34:13.988,00:34:16.418,00:00:02.430,that equals one so by twenty-five,
585,10,2,00:34:17.335,00:34:31.983,00:00:14.648,it's a long (inaudible) one times negative the other number so twenty-five pause filler the horrible thumb,

601,10,2,00:35:14.363,00:35:18.156,00:00:03.793,,because seventy is being subtracted and same to the opposite operation
602,10,2,00:35:18.156,00:35:21.323,00:00:03.167,,you get rid of seventeen like
603,10,2,00:35:22.849,00:35:25.620,00:00:02.771,,so make negative seventeen and zero
604,10,2,00:35:25.636,00:35:26.754,00:00:01.118,,you have to add something to it
605,10,2,00:35:27.161,00:35:29.536,00:00:02.375,,so I think of it so

694,10,2,00:40:19.874,00:40:27.075,00:00:07.201,,okay so you're so much faster than me
695,10,2,00:40:28.832,00:40:29.764,00:00:00.932,I do it on my mind,
696,10,2,00:40:30.168,00:40:30.638,00:00:00.470,,yeah
697,10,2,00:40:31.663,00:40:33.243,00:00:01.580,I do it mentally,
698,10,2,00:40:33.369,00:40:35.941,00:00:02.572,,my math mind can't take the pressure
699,10,2,00:40:36.092,00:40:38.924,00:00:02.832,yeah so we get rid of fifty-four first,
700,10,2,00:40:38.932,00:40:41.857,00:00:02.925,so it's all right got to go,
701,10,2,00:40:48.285,00:41:01.739,00:00:13.454,that is the worst fifty-four I've ever oh my god oh right oh (laughter),
702,10,2,00:41:03.319,00:41:09.958,00:00:06.639,okay then minus five equals (laughter) nah right right,
703,10,2,00:41:11.714,00:41:12.605,00:00:00.891,,I know
704,10,2,00:41:14.403,00:41:15.227,00:00:00.824,what were you,
705,10,2,00:41:15.353,00:41:16.630,00:00:01.277,no I don't want the settings (laughter),
706,10,2,00:41:17.716,00:41:18.537,00:00:00.821,(laughter),
707,10,2,00:41:22.050,00:41:23.353,00:00:01.303,we then shift,
708,10,2,00:41:24.142,00:41:25.151,00:00:01.009,it says fifty-two,
709,10,2,00:41:25.277,00:41:27.815,00:00:02.538,goodbye fifty-four you will not be (inaudible),
710,10,2,00:41:29.529,00:41:30.647,00:00:01.118,,so now that's
711,10,2,00:41:29.815,00:41:31.117,00:00:01.302,so now I get rid of four,
712,10,2,00:41:31.974,00:41:41.319,00:00:09.345,,yeah I'm just going to rewrite it four over k
713,10,2,00:41:41.563,00:41:46.840,00:00:05.277,,oh my gosh maybe I should not (inaudible) to this oh well equals
714,10,2,00:41:48.479,00:41:51.949,00:00:03.470,,so it's not good sixty
715,10,2,00:41:50.279,00:41:51.050,00:00:00.771,(laughter),
716,10,2,00:41:51.962,00:41:53.277,00:00:01.315,,I'm going to go slow
717,10,2,00:41:53.277,00:41:57.629,00:00:04.352,,but I don't think it's working two
718,10,2,00:41:58.428,00:42:02.689,00:00:04.261,,oh well so they get rid of the four
719,10,2,00:42:02.689,00:42:04.487,00:00:01.798,,that doesn't look like a four
720,10,2,00:42:04.487,00:42:05.269,00:00:00.782,,it kind of looks like
721,10,2,00:42:04.965,00:42:05.588,00:00:00.623,(laughter),
722,10,2,00:42:06.621,00:42:10.706,00:00:04.085,,it kind of looks like this for some reason but like tilted
723,10,2,00:42:11.201,00:42:13.479,00:00:02.278,looks like a nine with a thing around four,
724,10,2,00:42:12.991,00:42:22.890,00:00:09.899,,yeah okay to get rid of the four two times four
725,10,2,00:42:25.546,00:42:27.773,00:00:02.227,or no because it's not a minus four,
726,10,2,00:42:27.773,00:42:30.924,00:00:03.151,it's a four times four will be six,
727,10,2,00:42:31.319,00:42:33.546,00:00:02.227,and twelve four times four wouldn't be zero,
728,10,2,00:42:33.640,00:42:34.355,00:00:00.715,,right right
729,10,2,00:42:36.000,00:42:37.235,00:00:01.235,so you have to divide it this time,
730,10,2,00:42:38.765,00:42:41.966,00:00:03.201,,divide it pause filler maybe
731,10,2,00:42:42.006,00:42:46.114,00:00:04.108,,wait four is being divided by k
732,10,2,00:42:46.678,00:42:47.664,00:00:00.986,nah what did I write,
733,10,2,00:42:47.664,00:42:48.557,00:00:00.893,I didn't even write a seven,
734,10,2,00:42:48.711,00:42:49.476,00:00:00.765,go away seven,
735,10,2,00:42:50.000,00:42:50.966,00:00:00.966,,and maybe you're right
736,10,2,00:42:52.362,00:43:01.362,00:00:09.000,undo undo oh (laughter) the face is like an eight so four,
737,10,2,00:43:01.899,00:43:03.389,00:00:01.490,it's like a four equals,
738,10,2,00:43:03.758,00:43:05.973,00:00:02.215,we'll just say zero if not equals one,
739,10,2,00:43:07.248,00:43:08.013,00:00:00.765,,you know
740,10,2,00:43:08.221,00:43:12.651,00:00:04.430,but one can go leave throughout the door goodbye jump out of window on,
741,10,2,00:43:11.115,00:43:11.745,00:00:00.630,,(laughter)
742,10,2,00:43:12.711,00:43:14.939,00:00:02.228,,I think it just matters is
743,10,2,00:43:13.060,00:43:13.798,00:00:00.738,(laughter),
744,10,2,00:43:15.469,00:43:20.852,00:00:05.383,,it doesn't really matter like what you get on this side
745,10,2,00:43:21.080,00:43:22.865,00:00:01.785,,like does it really matter what you get on more side
746,10,2,00:43:22.865,00:43:27.201,00:00:04.336,,it just like matters what admiration yeah
747,10,2,00:43:27.537,00:43:27.818,00:00:00.281,six,
748,10,2,00:43:29.194,00:43:30.020,00:00:00.826,,oh I'm sorry
749,10,2,00:43:30.020,00:43:30.490,00:00:00.470,,I'm trying to
750,10,2,00:43:30.570,00:43:31.094,00:00:00.524,,I'm sorry
751,10,2,00:43:31.094,00:43:31.671,00:00:00.577,,I was going to be
752,10,2,00:43:31.308,00:43:31.959,00:00:00.651,it's fine,
753,10,2,00:43:32.080,00:43:33.953,00:00:01.873,,I was like trying to reverse my arrow
754,10,2,00:43:33.966,00:43:37.167,00:00:03.201,,and you were trying to divide it the same time
755,10,2,00:43:37.174,00:43:38.040,00:00:00.866,,I was trying to erase
756,10,2,00:43:38.617,00:43:43.476,00:00:04.859,kind of planning this stuff (laughter) so then stop,
757,10,2,00:43:43.691,00:43:45.490,00:00:01.799,I don't want the settings,
758,10,2,00:43:46.496,00:43:49.322,00:00:02.826,,yeah maybe you're pushing the button
759,10,2,00:43:50.214,00:43:54.678,00:00:04.464,no when you press two card for too long it immediately pops up,
760,10,2,00:43:54.939,00:43:55.537,00:00:00.598,,oh okay
761,10,2,00:43:56.114,00:43:59.496,00:00:03.382,so one minus that,
762,10,2,00:43:59.818,00:44:01.020,00:00:01.202,,wait one second
763,10,2,00:44:01.020,00:44:04.396,00:00:03.376,,I'm going to sign something might tell this
764,10,2,00:44:05.698,00:44:09.308,00:00:03.610,so four oh (inaudible) scratch paper (laughter),
765,10,2,00:44:11.161,00:44:16.315,00:00:05.154,,see okay well I have (inaudible)
766,10,2,00:44:16.315,00:44:21.825,00:00:05.510,,and it's two over x equals twenty
767,10,2,00:44:22.080,00:44:25.006,00:00:02.926,,it says which is what we have right now
768,10,2,00:44:25.275,00:44:28.282,00:00:03.007,,and this is multiply both sides by x
769,10,2,00:44:29.704,00:44:30.570,00:00:00.866,oh no no,
770,10,2,00:44:31.912,00:44:34.429,00:00:02.517,,so if you multiply
771,10,2,00:44:31.942,00:44:32.604,00:00:00.662,(laughter),
772,10,2,00:44:35.094,00:44:36.745,00:00:01.651,,wait this is what we're supposed to do
773,10,2,00:44:36.852,00:44:39.624,00:00:02.772,,so as you multiply both sides by x
774,10,2,00:44:39.530,00:44:39.959,00:00:00.429,got it,
775,10,2,00:44:40.818,00:44:41.369,00:00:00.551,,you got it
776,10,2,00:44:41.825,00:44:42.114,00:00:00.289,yeah,
777,10,2,00:44:42.423,00:44:42.780,00:00:00.357,,okay
778,10,2,00:44:43.378,00:44:45.297,00:00:01.919,because it would be twenty,
779,10,2,00:44:44.973,00:44:45.861,00:00:00.888,,because this thing is
780,10,2,00:44:47.114,00:44:48.486,00:00:01.372,,I don't know if you're supposed to do that
781,10,2,00:44:48.502,00:44:50.166,00:00:01.664,,because it's the same set of
782,10,2,00:44:50.231,00:44:54.216,00:00:03.985,,its two over x equals twenty
783,10,2,00:44:54.293,00:44:59.320,00:00:05.027,,and then it says multiply both sides by x (inaudible)
784,10,2,00:44:57.915,00:45:05.108,00:00:07.193,but we have the fifty-four to before the k plus fifty-four,
785,10,2,00:45:03.089,00:45:03.671,00:00:00.582,,yeah
786,10,2,00:45:05.621,00:45:11.158,00:00:05.537,,yeah but that's the equation like we have right now like in the green
787,10,2,00:45:12.417,00:45:14.000,00:00:01.583,,so I don't know if that would tell
788,10,2,00:45:16.251,00:45:19.135,00:00:02.884,,but technically we would follow the same steps and then
789,10,2,00:45:18.617,00:45:19.278,00:00:00.661,oh that's okay,
790,10,2,00:45:22.347,00:45:28.031,00:00:05.684,,okay so divided by x so then if we would divide it by k
791,10,2,00:45:30.818,00:45:31.756,00:00:00.938,,you would just be left with
792,10,2,00:45:35.536,00:45:40.532,00:00:04.996,,if we do it this way we would be left with
793,10,2,00:45:40.633,00:45:41.231,00:00:00.598,,was that four
794,10,2,00:45:43.316,00:45:44.370,00:00:01.054,there would be no remainder,
795,10,2,00:45:45.119,00:45:45.316,00:00:00.197,,hmm
796,10,2,00:45:46.081,00:45:47.077,00:00:00.996,there will be no remainder,
797,10,2,00:45:47.865,00:45:50.822,00:00:02.957,,for that one okay I'm just going to real quick do it this way
798,10,2,00:45:50.822,00:45:51.872,00:00:01.050,,and see if you get the same answer
799,10,2,00:45:55.177,00:45:56.164,00:00:00.987,well you see what I did,
800,10,2,00:45:56.164,00:46:04.566,00:00:08.402,so (laughter) yeah let's break (laughter),
801,10,2,00:46:10.699,00:46:17.541,00:00:06.842,,(inaudible) equals sixty-two k
802,10,2,00:46:24.938,00:46:25.541,00:00:00.603,nice snails,
803,10,2,00:46:26.497,00:46:28.114,00:00:01.617,,thanks I only did one hand
804,10,2,00:46:28.378,00:46:29.082,00:00:00.704,nice,
805,10,2,00:46:28.875,00:46:31.133,00:00:02.258,,I was too lazy okay
806,10,2,00:46:30.843,00:46:31.472,00:00:00.629,yeah that's me,
807,10,2,00:46:32.114,00:46:56.032,00:00:23.918,,I know so divide both sides by twenty twenty sixty-two wait still worst sixty-two ever
808,10,2,00:46:56.128,00:46:56.623,00:00:00.495,(laughter),
809,10,2,00:46:57.881,00:47:01.346,00:00:03.465,,it says divide both sides by the number
810,10,2,00:47:02.409,00:47:07.422,00:00:05.013,,and then we just (inaudible)
811,10,2,00:47:07.422,00:47:08.585,00:00:01.163,,that makes no sense
812,10,2,00:47:09.214,00:47:10.629,00:00:01.415,,oh I guess that does
813,10,2,00:47:10.661,00:47:23.560,00:00:12.899,,then I get four over sixty-two equals k
814,10,2,00:47:26.013,00:47:30.849,00:00:04.836,,and then you simplify the four over sixty-two by dividing it
815,10,2,00:47:31.164,00:47:32.774,00:00:01.610,,which is what we did here
816,10,2,00:47:33.139,00:47:34.812,00:00:01.673,,and you get one five five
817,10,2,00:47:35.145,00:47:37.353,00:00:02.208,,so like we got the same answers
818,10,2,00:47:37.365,00:47:38.862,00:00:01.497,,so this would be the answer
819,10,2,00:47:39.805,00:47:42.277,00:00:02.472,,but we did it different ways
820,10,2,00:47:42.604,00:47:42.774,00:00:00.170,yeah,
821,10,2,00:47:43.585,00:47:47.548,00:00:03.963,,okay but I don't think it really matters at this point because
822,10,2,00:47:47.529,00:47:50.982,00:00:03.453,(inaudible) (laughter) you made it a lot further last time,
823,10,2,00:47:51.699,00:47:52.082,00:00:00.383,,huh
824,10,2,00:47:52.353,00:47:53.805,00:00:01.452,you made it a lot further last time,
825,10,2,00:47:54.390,00:48:03.290,00:00:08.900,,yeah okay negative I think
826,10,2,00:48:04.321,00:48:05.485,00:00:01.164,,wait this is like
827,10,2,00:48:07.277,00:48:08.636,00:00:01.359,,it's like a first one
828,10,2,00:48:08.636,00:48:12.881,00:00:04.245,,but it's just the order is switched I think
