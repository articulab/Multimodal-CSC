43,8,1,00:04:20.100,00:04:23.000,00:00:02.900,so it looks like (inaudible),
44,8,1,00:05:58.000,00:06:01.500,00:00:03.500,oh my god what's taking them so long,

47,8,1,00:06:32.400,00:06:33.000,00:00:00.600,the first tab,
48,8,1,00:06:37.000,00:06:37.600,00:00:00.600,this one,
49,8,1,00:06:38.540,00:06:39.030,00:00:00.490,okay,
50,8,1,00:06:41.200,00:06:43.000,00:00:01.800,(inaudible) on here or oops,

52,8,1,00:07:04.360,00:07:04.600,00:00:00.240,yeah,
53,8,1,00:07:15.210,00:07:23.780,00:00:08.570,okay,
54,8,1,00:07:32.500,00:07:33.200,00:00:00.700,alright,
55,8,1,00:07:36.400,00:07:40.040,00:00:03.640,so get back to one all right,
56,8,1,00:07:41.000,00:07:44.890,00:00:03.890,so do you know the basic idea of how to do this?,
57,8,1,00:07:45.200,00:07:46.120,00:00:00.920,,mm-hmm
58,8,1,00:07:46.200,00:07:50.100,00:00:03.900,okay so can you just I don't know,
59,8,1,00:07:50.700,00:07:52.000,00:00:01.300,so what's the answer,
60,8,1,00:07:52.600,00:07:53.200,00:00:00.600,,nineteen
61,8,1,00:07:53.700,00:07:59.900,00:00:06.200,awesome okay so just (inaudible) work just adding that all right,
62,8,1,00:07:59.900,00:08:02.000,00:00:02.100,so this base idea you can just,
63,8,1,00:08:03.500,00:08:04.500,00:00:01.000,do you have any answer,
64,8,1,00:08:05.600,00:08:06.400,00:00:00.800,,for this one
65,8,1,00:08:06.300,00:08:06.900,00:00:00.600,yeah,
66,8,1,00:08:11.900,00:08:12.700,00:00:00.800,,pause filler seven
67,8,1,00:08:14.400,00:08:22.600,00:00:08.200,okay so when we have a negative right here we want to the other side,
68,8,1,00:08:23.300,00:08:25.300,00:00:02.000,we want to add it,
69,8,1,00:08:25.300,00:08:26.800,00:00:01.500,,add it on both sides
70,8,1,00:08:26.800,00:08:33.000,00:00:06.200,yeah and then sorry for my handwriting and so fifteen,
71,8,1,00:08:33.900,00:08:34.600,00:00:00.700,you add that,
72,8,1,00:08:34.600,00:08:39.400,00:00:04.800,and you got twenty-three equals k,
73,8,1,00:08:39.400,00:08:42.600,00:00:03.200,all right does that makes sense,
74,8,1,00:08:40.400,00:08:42.700,00:00:02.300,,mm-hmm
75,8,1,00:08:42.900,00:08:47.200,00:00:04.300,awesome okay next question so can you try this again,
76,8,1,00:08:49.200,00:08:50.600,00:00:01.400,,negative six
77,8,1,00:08:51.100,00:08:53.700,00:00:02.600,awesome so you know subtraction cool,
78,8,1,00:08:59.400,00:09:02.200,00:00:02.800,okay so here here's a good question,
79,8,1,00:09:02.200,00:09:04.200,00:00:02.000,can you do this one for me,
80,8,1,00:09:04.900,00:09:07.040,00:00:02.140,,pause filler minus fourteen
81,8,1,00:09:07.330,00:09:07.800,00:00:00.470,yeah,
82,8,1,00:09:37.500,00:09:38.400,00:00:00.900,,five
83,8,1,00:09:38.700,00:09:39.900,00:00:01.200,awesome cool,
84,8,1,00:09:43.000,00:09:49.000,00:00:06.000,yeah this one is (inaudible) right here,
85,8,1,00:09:49.000,00:09:51.880,00:00:02.880,okay so here's a two separate equation,
86,8,1,00:09:52.000,00:09:53.200,00:00:01.200,so you should do that,
87,8,1,00:09:54.200,00:09:54.800,00:00:00.600,,pause filler
88,8,1,00:10:12.480,00:10:13.710,00:00:01.230,,hmm
89,8,1,00:10:23.700,00:10:26.440,00:00:02.740,so do you know how to do this right,
90,8,1,00:10:26.800,00:10:27.500,00:00:00.700,,mm-hmm
91,8,1,00:10:27.800,00:10:33.500,00:00:05.700,yeah so you're not really going to get a whole number,
92,8,1,00:10:33.500,00:10:36.800,00:00:03.300,so just kind of tell me what fraction you got at the end was,
93,8,1,00:10:38.300,00:10:40.000,00:00:01.700,,hmm
94,8,1,00:10:43.700,00:10:45.300,00:00:01.600,,oh I like this pen
95,8,1,00:10:51.710,00:10:52.640,00:00:00.930,,(inaudible)
96,8,1,00:10:53.000,00:10:59.890,00:00:06.890,yeah okay so yeah so let's do it here,
97,8,1,00:10:59.890,00:11:01.800,00:00:01.910,so you add nine to both sides,
98,8,1,00:11:02.100,00:11:02.750,00:00:00.650,,uh-huh
99,8,1,00:11:03.700,00:11:10.800,00:00:07.100,and then so you have thirteen p equals fifty,
100,8,1,00:11:11.400,00:11:21.080,00:00:09.680,and you got thirteen pause filler end up with p equals fifty divided by thirteen,
101,8,1,00:11:22.000,00:11:25.600,00:00:03.600,and if you want to solve that out or just do that,
102,8,1,00:11:25.600,00:11:29.400,00:00:03.800,you don't really have to questions like that,
103,8,1,00:11:29.400,00:11:33.000,00:00:03.600,it's either you got a fraction,
104,8,1,00:11:33.000,00:11:33.900,00:00:00.900,you should leave it like that,
105,8,1,00:11:33.900,00:11:35.200,00:00:01.300,or put it here okay,
106,8,1,00:11:35.200,00:11:38.000,00:00:02.800,so next question can you do this please,
107,8,1,00:11:38.500,00:11:39.440,00:00:00.940,,mm-hmm
108,8,1,00:11:40.000,00:11:41.500,00:00:01.500,someone's watching us here,
109,8,1,00:11:42.400,00:11:47.020,00:00:04.620,,yeah let's see oh something
110,8,1,00:11:48.300,00:11:49.400,00:00:01.100,what,
111,8,1,00:11:49.500,00:11:52.000,00:00:02.500,,so something's messing up with this pen
112,8,1,00:11:52.400,00:11:52.600,00:00:00.200,aw,
113,8,1,00:11:56.000,00:11:58.770,00:00:02.770,,just clicking new tabs and stuff
114,8,1,00:11:59.200,00:11:59.990,00:00:00.790,uh-huh,
115,8,1,00:12:01.700,00:12:08.040,00:00:06.340,oh pause filler so try to go back to the one you are pause filler in the first one,
116,8,1,00:12:10.630,00:12:11.140,00:00:00.510,,(inaudible)
117,8,1,00:12:43.000,00:12:43.900,00:00:00.900,,it's four
118,8,1,00:12:44.400,00:12:56.100,00:00:11.700,awesome okay onto the next question okay so let's work on this,
119,8,1,00:12:56.100,00:13:01.000,00:00:04.900,seven equals sixteen,
120,8,1,00:13:15.300,00:13:16.000,00:00:00.700,okay,
121,8,1,00:13:26.600,00:13:29.050,00:00:02.450,this is another one where you're not going to get a whole number,
122,8,1,00:13:29.500,00:13:30.000,00:00:00.500,,uh-huh
123,8,1,00:14:01.580,00:14:02.070,00:00:00.490,okay,
124,8,1,00:14:06.400,00:14:16.000,00:00:09.600,so you pause filler what you're doing it's the same it's again probably pretty much the same thing as the one we did earlier it's just pause filler,
125,8,1,00:14:17.600,00:14:18.600,00:00:01.000,,but it works
126,8,1,00:14:19.000,00:14:24.800,00:00:05.800,yeah so really it doesn't matter where the k ends,
127,8,1,00:14:24.800,00:14:28.000,00:00:03.200,it just matters where you pause filler,
128,8,1,00:14:28.800,00:14:32.600,00:00:03.800,I mean you just want to have the k by itself on one side,
129,8,1,00:14:34.200,00:14:40.900,00:00:06.700,and so what you want to try to do is you want to get,
130,8,1,00:14:42.200,00:14:44.800,00:00:02.600,oops sorry you want to get this,
131,8,1,00:14:44.900,00:14:49.200,00:00:04.300,oops you want to get this over here,
132,8,1,00:14:50.300,00:14:54.300,00:00:04.000,and you want to get that fifteen over here,
133,8,1,00:14:55.200,00:15:02.300,00:00:07.100,and so basically when you're working with these you want to pause filler you pause filler,
134,8,1,00:15:02.300,00:15:07.400,00:00:05.100,it's kind of like an inverse operations inverse order of operations type of thing,
135,8,1,00:15:07.400,00:15:13.700,00:00:06.300,so you want to do addition or subtraction first and then multiplication or division,
136,8,1,00:15:15.500,00:15:21.300,00:00:05.800,so you're going to start with getting the twenty-two to the other side and then dividing by fifteen,
137,8,1,00:15:37.000,00:15:39.900,00:00:02.900,,(inaudible) should just give us the (inaudible)
138,8,1,00:15:41.200,00:15:45.600,00:00:04.400,yeah or maybe it's like some kind of test or something,
139,8,1,00:15:45.600,00:15:50.600,00:00:05.000,okay so here we have a negative number here,
140,8,1,00:15:51.400,00:15:53.700,00:00:02.300,so you want to add it,
141,8,1,00:15:53.700,00:15:55.900,00:00:02.200,and then you have a multiplication,
142,8,1,00:15:57.000,00:15:59.000,00:00:02.000,you want to give so multiply,
143,8,1,00:15:59.000,00:16:03.900,00:00:04.900,so you want to divide it,
144,8,1,00:16:06.600,00:16:11.300,00:00:04.700,and so this is first,
145,8,1,00:16:11.300,00:16:12.900,00:00:01.600,and then this is second,
146,8,1,00:16:41.700,00:16:43.700,00:00:02.000,,well it is making me mad
147,8,1,00:16:47.100,00:16:51.400,00:00:04.300,yeah okay so let's do this together,
148,8,1,00:16:51.400,00:16:54.500,00:00:03.100,so we have twenty-two and some negative,
149,8,1,00:16:54.800,00:16:59.900,00:00:05.100,so we want to add twenty-two to both sides so,
150,8,1,00:17:00.300,00:17:03.200,00:00:02.900,and that gets rid of this twenty-two,
151,8,1,00:17:03.200,00:17:11.300,00:00:08.100,and that makes this sixty-two courtesy of this fifteen right here,
152,8,1,00:17:12.300,00:17:14.400,00:00:02.100,and since it's multiplied b k,
153,8,1,00:17:14.400,00:17:15.800,00:00:01.400,you want to divide it,
154,8,1,00:17:17.000,00:17:22.200,00:00:05.200,so you divide sixty-two by fifteen,
155,8,1,00:17:23.100,00:17:24.200,00:00:01.100,and that equals k,
156,8,1,00:17:33.000,00:17:35.300,00:00:02.300,,what then k equals pause filler
157,8,1,00:17:35.900,00:17:37.600,00:00:01.700,k equals sixty-two,
158,8,1,00:17:37.600,00:17:44.200,00:00:06.600,,k equals sixty-two sixty-two divided by five is like four
159,8,1,00:17:45.000,00:17:46.400,00:00:01.400,it's divided by fifteen,
160,8,1,00:17:46.400,00:17:49.600,00:00:03.200,and it's about four yeah,
161,8,1,00:17:50.500,00:17:51.300,00:00:00.800,so that's good,
162,8,1,00:17:51.400,00:17:55.400,00:00:04.000,it's four and two fifteens okay so next question,
163,8,1,00:17:58.000,00:17:58.510,00:00:00.510,okay,
164,8,1,00:18:00.500,00:18:02.900,00:00:02.400,this one is also pretty easy,
165,8,1,00:18:03.000,00:18:05.230,00:00:02.230,so that's one of the easier ones,
166,8,1,00:18:13.600,00:18:14.500,00:00:00.900,,there's three
167,8,1,00:18:15.100,00:18:15.700,00:00:00.600,what,
168,8,1,00:18:15.900,00:18:16.500,00:00:00.600,,three
169,8,1,00:18:16.800,00:18:18.700,00:00:01.900,yeah awesome,
170,8,1,00:18:23.200,00:18:23.900,00:00:00.700,great,
171,8,1,00:18:25.700,00:18:27.440,00:00:01.740,next question okay,
172,8,1,00:18:29.800,00:18:30.700,00:00:00.900,that is,
173,8,1,00:18:30.700,00:18:31.500,00:00:00.800,,three again
174,8,1,00:18:31.800,00:18:33.300,00:00:01.500,three yeah well,
175,8,1,00:18:39.200,00:18:40.100,00:00:00.900,great okay,
176,8,1,00:18:43.400,00:18:46.000,00:00:02.600,question is okay,
177,8,1,00:18:47.700,00:18:50.800,00:00:03.100,so you have k on both sides,
178,8,1,00:18:50.800,00:18:55.100,00:00:04.300,so you want to get both of the Ks just to one side,
179,8,1,00:18:55.600,00:18:58.300,00:00:02.700,and since you have more Ks over here,
180,8,1,00:18:58.300,00:19:00.700,00:00:02.400,you want to get rid of this k,
181,8,1,00:19:01.800,00:19:05.600,00:00:03.800,so since if there's no positive or negative sign next to it,
182,8,1,00:19:05.600,00:19:07.800,00:00:02.200,that means it's positive,
183,8,1,00:19:09.200,00:19:12.100,00:00:02.900,so you would subtract k from both sides,
184,8,1,00:19:13.500,00:19:20.900,00:00:07.400,and so you would have negative ten equals seven k minus sixty-eight,
185,8,1,00:19:21.200,00:19:23.700,00:00:02.500,and then can you work out from there,
186,8,1,00:19:24.000,00:19:24.900,00:00:00.900,,um hmm
187,8,1,00:19:41.300,00:19:43.090,00:00:01.790,,like add something
188,8,1,00:19:43.400,00:19:45.500,00:00:02.100,okay so let's close it,
189,8,1,00:19:45.700,00:19:49.900,00:00:04.200,so this is negative,
190,8,1,00:19:50.000,00:19:51.600,00:00:01.600,we want to add it to both sides,
191,8,1,00:19:51.600,00:19:52.800,00:00:01.200,so since this is,
192,8,1,00:19:53.200,00:19:55.500,00:00:02.300,so you add sixty-eight to both sides,
193,8,1,00:19:56.400,00:19:59.100,00:00:02.700,and so you have negative ten on this side,
194,8,1,00:20:00.000,00:20:04.800,00:00:04.800,so that's basically saying sixty-eight plus negative ten is also right,
195,8,1,00:20:05.600,00:20:11.000,00:00:05.400,yeah sixty-eight minus ten is negative ten plus sixty-eight,
196,8,1,00:20:11.200,00:20:21.100,00:00:09.900,so you have sixty-eight minus ten equals seven k,
197,8,1,00:20:22.200,00:20:29.200,00:00:07.000,and so you have fifty-eight equals seven k,
198,8,1,00:20:30.100,00:20:32.100,00:00:02.000,so can you do that,
199,8,1,00:20:32.660,00:20:33.150,00:00:00.490,,mm-hmm
200,8,1,00:20:34.900,00:20:36.600,00:00:01.700,,so fifty-eight minus seven k
201,8,1,00:20:37.800,00:20:39.700,00:00:01.900,fifty-eight equals seven k,
202,8,1,00:20:39.800,00:20:41.120,00:00:01.320,so my handwriting is terrible,
203,8,1,00:20:49.600,00:20:51.000,00:00:01.400,,four something
204,8,1,00:21:15.000,00:21:17.400,00:00:02.400,,oh that equals
205,8,1,00:21:19.100,00:21:21.900,00:00:02.800,,I think it's like eight around eight
206,8,1,00:21:21.000,00:21:21.550,00:00:00.550,yup,
207,8,1,00:21:22.200,00:21:23.700,00:00:01.500,yeah that's exactly eight,
208,8,1,00:21:28.300,00:21:29.200,00:00:00.900,awesome,
209,8,1,00:21:30.100,00:21:33.400,00:00:03.300,so that is ten questions,
210,8,1,00:21:35.700,00:21:36.990,00:00:01.290,so there we go,
211,8,1,00:21:41.000,00:21:41.900,00:00:00.900,awesome,
212,8,1,00:21:44.000,00:21:46.200,00:00:02.200,so now we kind of just wait,
213,8,1,00:21:47.700,00:21:51.990,00:00:04.290,,do you have another tab open as Scribbler over
214,8,1,00:21:52.500,00:21:53.000,00:00:00.500,yeah,
215,8,1,00:21:53.100,00:21:55.700,00:00:02.600,,I think that one we're supposed to do next
216,8,1,00:21:57.800,00:22:00.300,00:00:02.500,all right I don't know,
217,8,1,00:22:00.300,00:22:03.230,00:00:02.930,they just told me to go to eleven and then stop,
218,8,1,00:22:03.230,00:22:06.870,00:00:03.640,so who knows,
219,8,1,00:22:11.000,00:22:14.100,00:00:03.100,maybe for someone else there another time,
220,8,1,00:22:38.900,00:22:40.800,00:00:01.900,or maybe we're supposed to,
221,8,1,00:22:41.200,00:22:46.430,00:00:05.230,actually I think we're supposed to come out and actually get them,
222,8,1,00:22:47.600,00:22:48.700,00:00:01.100,,okay
223,8,1,00:23:50.300,00:23:52.700,00:00:02.400,so are we going up to twenty-four,
224,8,1,00:23:55.000,00:23:55.800,00:00:00.800,okay,
225,8,1,00:24:16.000,00:24:21.300,00:00:05.300,all right so we have another ten questions to do,
226,8,1,00:24:21.500,00:24:23.800,00:00:02.300,,yeah I want to switch to this computer
227,8,1,00:24:25.600,00:24:26.550,00:00:00.950,yeah okay,
228,8,1,00:24:26.700,00:24:27.560,00:00:00.860,,how to do that
229,8,1,00:24:28.100,00:24:29.500,00:00:01.400,,oh one second
230,8,1,00:25:56.230,00:25:57.700,00:00:01.470,,I don't know why we're kind of through this
231,8,1,00:25:58.300,00:26:06.800,00:00:08.500,all right so do you want to start working on this,
232,8,1,00:26:09.500,00:26:10.120,00:00:00.620,,yeah
233,8,1,00:26:10.700,00:26:11.700,00:00:01.000,so let's just,
234,8,1,00:26:16.900,00:26:19.000,00:00:02.100,we should remember what our signs are,
235,8,1,00:26:19.500,00:26:21.700,00:00:02.200,this is the negative,
236,8,1,00:26:22.200,00:26:23.600,00:00:01.400,this is the positive,
237,8,1,00:26:24.000,00:26:24.800,00:00:00.800,that's a positive,
238,8,1,00:26:24.800,00:26:27.000,00:00:02.200,so you can try to do that,
239,8,1,00:26:42.000,00:26:42.540,00:00:00.540,oh,
240,8,1,00:26:43.100,00:26:44.600,00:00:01.500,,oh my gosh this mouse (inaudible)
241,8,1,00:26:46.000,00:26:48.600,00:00:02.600,okay wait don't press the wrong button,
242,8,1,00:26:50.000,00:26:53.000,00:00:03.000,let's go there there okay,
243,8,1,00:27:02.000,00:27:03.400,00:00:01.400,,I don't know none of this
244,8,1,00:27:03.900,00:27:11.300,00:00:07.400,okay so here so you want to get the r on just one side,
245,8,1,00:27:11.600,00:27:14.300,00:00:02.700,so since you have less r on here,
246,8,1,00:27:14.300,00:27:15.000,00:00:00.700,you just have one r,
247,8,1,00:27:15.000,00:27:17.000,00:00:02.000,so you subtract r from this side,
248,8,1,00:27:18.700,00:27:20.000,00:00:01.300,and subtract r from that side,
249,8,1,00:27:20.000,00:27:24.200,00:00:04.200,and you have negative thirty-three equals r,
250,8,1,00:27:24.200,00:27:26.000,00:00:01.800,because you subtract to one,
251,8,1,00:27:27.400,00:27:29.380,00:00:01.980,,for this half for what
252,8,1,00:27:42.800,00:27:43.600,00:00:00.800,,thank you
253,8,1,00:27:56.200,00:27:59.200,00:00:03.000,yeah,
254,8,1,00:28:26.200,00:28:34.000,00:00:07.800,,you know what thirty minutes plus now we have twenty five minutes work
255,8,1,00:28:34.800,00:28:35.400,00:00:00.600,okay,
256,8,1,00:29:32.310,00:29:32.810,00:00:00.500,,ouch
257,8,1,00:29:36.200,00:29:39.100,00:00:02.900,,wait did he take my stylus again
258,8,1,00:29:41.600,00:29:46.000,00:00:04.400,,oh my gosh he's always taking my stylus
259,8,1,00:29:46.750,00:29:47.260,00:00:00.510,yeah,
260,8,1,00:30:11.900,00:30:13.700,00:00:01.800,,this is a big microphone
261,8,1,00:30:14.300,00:30:15.000,00:00:00.700,yeah,
262,8,1,00:30:24.000,00:30:25.180,00:00:01.180,testing,
263,8,1,00:31:45.000,00:31:45.700,00:00:00.700,,(inaudible)
264,8,1,00:31:48.000,00:31:55.900,00:00:07.900,yeah they have like a giant super computer connected to a terrible dumb monitors kind of funny,
265,8,1,00:32:30.100,00:32:32.100,00:00:02.000,,(inaudible)
266,8,1,00:32:33.600,00:32:34.000,00:00:00.400,yeah,
267,8,1,00:33:00.000,00:33:01.700,00:00:01.700,,pause filler isn't it
268,8,1,00:34:11.400,00:34:13.100,00:00:01.700,,they'll return five minutes
269,8,1,00:34:14.500,00:34:15.200,00:00:00.700,I don't know,
270,8,1,00:34:15.200,00:34:19.100,00:00:03.900,I don't think they're very good at telling time so far,
271,8,1,00:34:20.800,00:34:25.500,00:00:04.700,they don't exactly keep their promises,
272,8,1,00:34:27.200,00:34:29.100,00:00:01.900,,well here they come now
273,8,1,00:34:29.100,00:34:31.300,00:00:02.200,,I think they can hear us or see us
274,8,1,00:34:32.500,00:34:33.000,00:00:00.500,probably,
275,8,1,00:34:47.400,00:34:48.000,00:00:00.600,no,
276,8,1,00:34:58.500,00:35:00.000,00:00:01.500,,do we have to turn them in
277,8,1,00:35:14.700,00:35:18.700,00:00:04.000,all right so do we like try to just kind of finish all over or,
278,8,1,00:35:24.000,00:35:28.600,00:00:04.600,also for the pause filler questions that like it's not a whole number,
279,8,1,00:35:28.600,00:35:32.400,00:00:03.800,do you want me to like actually solve it,
280,8,1,00:35:32.400,00:35:34.560,00:00:02.160,or can I just leave it as,
281,8,1,00:35:46.200,00:35:49.700,00:00:03.500,okay cool okay so this is,
282,8,1,00:35:49.700,00:35:54.130,00:00:04.430,x equals twenty-five,
