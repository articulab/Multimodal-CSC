00:06:32.597,00:06:33.571,00:00:00.974,,,,,"so you'll be in the green text"
00:06:33.922,00:06:35.675,00:00:01.753,,,,,"and just be like last time"
00:06:35.953,00:06:36.102,00:00:00.149,,,,"okay",

00:06:40.053,00:06:41.300,00:00:01.247,,,,,"but not the same numbers"
00:06:43.012,00:06:46.753,00:00:03.741,,,,"okay oh we've got one to ten again",
00:06:47.985,00:06:48.181,00:00:00.196,,,,,"yeah so how many do we have this time"
00:06:48.181,00:06:50.142,00:00:01.961,,,"you have about twenty minutes",,"yeah so how many do we have this time"
00:06:50.142,00:06:52.220,00:00:02.078,,,"you have about twenty minutes",,
00:06:52.220,00:06:52.987,00:00:00.767,,,"you have about twenty minutes",,"all right okay"
00:06:52.987,00:06:54.766,00:00:01.779,,,"you have about twenty minutes",,
00:06:58.064,00:07:01.753,00:00:03.689,,,"okay so we'll start with the mouse this time",,"awesome so can we start"
00:07:01.753,00:07:05.415,00:00:03.662,,,"okay so we'll start with the mouse this time",,
00:07:05.415,00:07:05.740,00:00:00.325,,,"okay so we'll start with the mouse this time",,"okay do you know how to do this"
00:07:05.740,00:07:07.272,00:00:01.532,,,,,"okay do you know how to do this"
00:07:08.623,00:07:11.714,00:00:03.091,,,,"pause filler I think so",
00:07:12.230,00:07:12.529,00:00:00.299,,,"yes",,
00:07:12.714,00:07:13.242,00:00:00.528,,,,,"okay"
00:07:35.118,00:07:36.744,00:00:01.626,,,,,"I don't think you got a whole number"
00:07:36.854,00:07:38.771,00:00:01.917,,,,,"so just like whatever the fraction is at the end"
00:07:40.500,00:07:42.371,00:00:01.871,,,,"wouldn't it be like four or something",
00:07:43.042,00:07:48.042,00:00:05.000,,,,,"oh I think so because you have so when we divide it by three"
00:07:49.128,00:07:51.114,00:00:01.986,,,,,"it sounds I can't right on these"
00:07:51.114,00:07:58.914,00:00:07.800,,,,,"pause filler you actually are multiplying it by seven over three"
00:07:59.004,00:07:59.612,00:00:00.608,,,,,"so you have"
00:08:00.530,00:08:01.700,00:00:01.170,,,,,"I should get rid of this"
00:08:03.828,00:08:10.871,00:00:07.043,,,,,"pause filler forty times seven over three"
00:08:12.912,00:08:13.700,00:00:00.788,,,,,"equals x"
00:08:14.738,00:08:18.609,00:00:03.871,,,,,"so x equals two hundred"
00:08:20.276,00:08:21.528,00:00:01.252,,,,"so what it would be ninety-three",
00:08:22.351,00:08:24.715,00:00:02.364,,,,,"it would be over three"
00:08:24.715,00:08:31.211,00:00:06.496,,,,,"pause filler it doesn't I don't think it goes into three equally"
00:08:31.211,00:08:32.987,00:00:01.776,,,,,"so you just have this is the answer"
00:08:36.249,00:08:36.898,00:00:00.649,,,,"two eighty",
00:08:37.217,00:08:38.275,00:00:01.058,,,,,"two eighty over three"
00:08:39.133,00:08:41.148,00:00:02.015,,,,"perfect pause filler I get it now",
00:08:41.348,00:08:44.451,00:00:03.103,,,,,"yeah okay so next pause filler same idea"
00:08:45.019,00:08:45.458,00:00:00.439,,,,"yes",
00:08:59.157,00:09:00.828,00:00:01.671,,,,,"so the next one would be"
00:09:19.002,00:09:19.770,00:00:00.768,,,,"right",
00:09:19.770,00:09:20.978,00:00:01.208,,,,,"yup perfect"
00:09:21.626,00:09:22.075,00:00:00.449,,,,,"awesome"
00:09:22.075,00:09:22.434,00:00:00.359,,,,,"let's go"
00:09:23.214,00:09:25.268,00:00:02.054,,,,,"pause filler so this one is two-step"
00:09:25.268,00:09:26.994,00:00:01.726,,,,,"it's pretty simple"
00:09:38.557,00:09:41.102,00:00:02.545,,,,"so it would be two times eighteen",
00:09:41.885,00:09:42.171,00:00:00.286,,,,,"no"
00:09:42.171,00:09:48.357,00:00:06.186,,,,,"so what you do is you add eighteen to both sides to get rid of it first"
00:09:49.042,00:09:58.071,00:00:09.029,,,,,"so you have seventy on this side and negative two thirds y"
00:09:58.071,00:10:01.457,00:00:03.386,,,,,"and then you just do the same thing except this part is negative"
00:10:16.600,00:10:19.428,00:00:02.828,,,,"this would be one forty negative one forty",
00:10:19.642,00:10:20.528,00:00:00.886,,,,,"pause filler yes wait no"
00:10:24.685,00:10:25.642,00:00:00.957,,,,"it's positive",
00:10:26.485,00:10:27.985,00:00:01.500,,,,,"oh two ten"
00:10:28.642,00:10:28.814,00:00:00.172,,,,"so (inaudible)",
00:10:30.371,00:10:39.942,00:00:09.571,,,,,"no no no because you do pause filler because when you divide this you have to multiply it by the reciprocal or three over two"
00:10:39.942,00:10:42.685,00:00:02.743,,,,,"so it's seventy times three divided by two"
00:10:44.342,00:10:46.928,00:00:02.586,,,,,"so that's two hundred ten divided by two"
00:10:48.257,00:10:49.828,00:00:01.571,,,,"twenty-two",
00:11:02.142,00:11:07.096,00:00:04.954,,,,,"so you got in the end one hundred five"
00:11:07.416,00:11:13.371,00:00:05.955,,,,,"yeah times don't mind what's right there but okay"
00:11:22.581,00:11:23.150,00:00:00.569,,,,,"okay"
00:11:23.428,00:11:23.928,00:00:00.500,,,,"thirteen oh",
00:11:26.014,00:11:28.185,00:00:02.171,,,,"so do we still add thirteen to both sides",
00:11:28.185,00:11:28.471,00:00:00.286,,,,"so do we still add thirteen to both sides","no"
00:11:28.471,00:11:28.485,00:00:00.014,,,,"so do we still add thirteen to both sides",
00:11:28.485,00:11:28.542,00:00:00.057,,,,"so do we still add thirteen to both sides","since this is positive you subtract thirteen to both sides"
00:11:28.542,00:11:33.071,00:00:04.529,,,,,"since this is positive you subtract thirteen to both sides"
00:11:33.757,00:11:35.442,00:00:01.685,,,,,"because you want to get rid of this"
00:12:04.845,00:12:08.357,00:00:03.512,,,,,"it's thirty-one"
00:12:09.245,00:12:09.774,00:00:00.529,,,,"is it",
00:12:10.482,00:12:10.712,00:00:00.230,,,,,"yeah"
00:12:12.308,00:12:12.588,00:00:00.280,,,,"oh",
00:12:17.746,00:12:19.731,00:00:01.985,,,,,"okay seven times that equals"
00:12:22.415,00:12:25.448,00:00:03.033,,,,,"one half x"
00:12:25.448,00:12:37.785,00:00:12.337,,,,,"and then this is as simple as just x equals two one times thirty-one"
00:12:38.314,00:12:39.628,00:00:01.314,,,,,"so what does x equal"
00:12:41.142,00:12:42.700,00:00:01.558,,,,"x equal",
00:12:44.828,00:12:46.357,00:00:01.529,,,,"okay x equals",
00:12:50.000,00:12:53.957,00:00:03.957,,,,"pause filler is that multiply",
00:12:54.383,00:12:55.370,00:00:00.987,,,,,"yeah it's multiply sorry"
00:13:01.536,00:13:02.464,00:00:00.928,,,,"sixty-two",
00:13:02.604,00:13:02.853,00:00:00.249,,,,,"yeah"
00:13:04.185,00:13:05.671,00:00:01.486,,,,"x equals",
00:13:10.077,00:13:11.055,00:00:00.978,,,,,"awesome"
00:13:15.800,00:13:17.414,00:00:01.614,,,,"they just like to come before",
00:13:17.957,00:13:20.771,00:00:02.814,,,,,"yeah and that's basically the same idea"
00:13:22.259,00:13:26.071,00:00:03.812,,,,,"since this is negative you are adding this time"
00:13:28.754,00:13:30.842,00:00:02.088,,,,"pause filler six time thirty-one",
00:13:46.128,00:13:46.628,00:00:00.500,,,,"wow",
00:13:55.683,00:13:57.016,00:00:01.333,,,,"forty-seven",
00:13:57.199,00:14:02.549,00:00:05.350,,,,,"yeah and this one kind of sucks because you have to multiply that by"
00:14:04.044,00:14:04.763,00:00:00.719,,,,"nineteen",
00:14:04.832,00:14:07.666,00:00:02.834,,,,"so this is nineteen over six",
00:14:08.083,00:14:08.483,00:00:00.400,,,,,"what"
00:14:09.103,00:14:11.817,00:00:02.714,,,,"is it nineteen over six",
00:14:11.986,00:14:17.703,00:00:05.717,,,,,"no because when you're adding it this is not affected by that"
00:14:18.422,00:14:26.503,00:00:08.081,,,,,"so when you add sixteen here it only affects that"
00:14:26.932,00:14:29.017,00:00:02.085,,,,,"so it only just gets rid of that"
00:14:29.017,00:14:35.862,00:00:06.845,,,,,"so you have forty-seven equals three six time x"
00:14:38.556,00:14:42.776,00:00:04.220,,,,"so forty-six times three over forty-seven times three",
00:14:43.674,00:14:50.120,00:00:06.446,,,,,"it's forty-seven times six because you're dividing by three"
00:14:50.968,00:14:58.321,00:00:07.353,,,,,"six plus means you're multiplying by six thirds"
00:15:06.812,00:15:14.025,00:00:07.213,,,,"yeah and then that is all over three",
00:15:14.903,00:15:15.911,00:00:01.008,,,,"six",
00:15:16.080,00:15:16.260,00:00:00.180,,,,,"three"
00:15:19.013,00:15:20.454,00:00:01.441,,,,,"because you have times yeah"
00:15:22.695,00:15:24.103,00:00:01.408,,,,,"and that should go in equally yeah"
00:15:35.000,00:15:36.454,00:00:01.454,,,,"that's the (inaudible) one",
00:15:36.923,00:15:42.857,00:00:05.934,,,,,"yeah this one shouldn't be too hard"
00:15:43.051,00:15:43.766,00:00:00.715,,,,,"let's see"
00:15:44.311,00:15:47.922,00:00:03.611,,,,,"pause filler since this is positive we're going to subtract that"
00:15:48.307,00:15:51.440,00:00:03.133,,,,,"and we're going to get a negative answer because that's negative"
00:15:53.166,00:15:55.259,00:00:02.093,,,,,"so you want to do this part"
00:15:55.259,00:15:55.750,00:00:00.491,,,,"ninety-seven minus eighteen","so you want to do this part"
00:15:55.750,00:15:57.519,00:00:01.769,,,,"ninety-seven minus eighteen",
00:15:58.754,00:15:59.512,00:00:00.758,,,,,"minus forty-eight"
00:16:00.675,00:16:01.714,00:00:01.039,,,,"oh it's minus forty-eight",
00:16:01.837,00:16:02.106,00:00:00.269,,,,,"yeah"
00:16:24.754,00:16:33.558,00:00:08.804,,,,,"what okay okay"
00:16:33.558,00:16:34.682,00:00:01.124,,,,"so forty-five oh","what okay okay"
00:16:34.682,00:16:34.753,00:00:00.071,,,,"so forty-five oh",
00:16:47.987,00:16:52.506,00:00:04.519,,,,"you know it would be forty-nine because it's forty-nine time twelve",
00:16:53.116,00:16:56.442,00:00:03.326,,,,,"so it would be forty-nine times five over twelve"
00:16:57.001,00:16:57.789,00:00:00.788,,,,,"and it's negative"
00:16:57.789,00:17:11.947,00:00:14.158,,,,,"so forty-nine times five over twelve equals y"
00:17:13.234,00:17:18.602,00:00:05.368,,,,,"and then you're just going to this is here"
00:17:18.652,00:17:22.373,00:00:03.721,,,,"this is forty-five",
00:17:23.155,00:17:27.851,00:00:04.696,,,,,"over so it's two forty-five all over twelve"
00:17:27.851,00:17:28.959,00:00:01.108,,,,,"that doesn't go any equally"
00:17:28.959,00:17:30.595,00:00:01.636,,,,,"so that's just there"
00:17:32.467,00:17:34.259,00:00:01.792,,,,,"yeah that's the answer to that"
00:17:36.584,00:17:37.623,00:00:01.039,,,,"do we stop answering",
00:17:38.558,00:17:41.116,00:00:02.558,,,,,"pause filler I think if we do it will tell us"
00:17:43.056,00:17:45.402,00:00:02.346,,,,,"I don't like this one okay so"
00:17:52.935,00:17:55.209,00:00:02.274,,,,,"so I'm going to rewrite this"
00:17:55.209,00:17:56.945,00:00:01.736,,,,,"you have negative six"
00:17:57.075,00:17:59.888,00:00:02.813,,,,,"just make eleven make a little more sense"
00:18:00.736,00:18:14.715,00:00:13.979,,,,,"minus sixty-one equals twenty-five plus seven over seven y because seven over seven equals one"
00:18:14.844,00:18:19.743,00:00:04.899,,,,,"so that makes it easier to do stuff between these two"
00:18:28.214,00:18:30.798,00:00:02.584,,,,"this is thirty-six",
00:18:31.610,00:18:39.548,00:00:07.938,,,,,"yeah okay so what you want to do is you want to get the twenty-five over here"
00:18:41.394,00:18:45.215,00:00:03.821,,,,,"and this over here"
00:18:47.680,00:18:49.376,00:00:01.696,,,,,"for either way but"
00:18:53.077,00:18:59.680,00:00:06.603,,,,,"so how you would so that is subtract twenty-five from both sides"
00:18:59.680,00:19:08.006,00:00:08.326,,,,,"you have negative six seven y minus"
00:19:08.273,00:19:16.185,00:00:07.912,,,,,"what's that eighty-six equals y"
00:19:17.332,00:19:25.254,00:00:07.922,,,,,"and then you can add six sevenths y to both sides"
00:19:26.531,00:19:31.300,00:00:04.769,,,,,"and so you have negative eighty-six equals"
00:19:32.089,00:19:37.087,00:00:04.998,,,,,"and since this is seven over seven you get"
00:19:39.173,00:19:46.526,00:00:07.353,,,,,"pause filler thirteen over seven y because that's just adding the six and the seven"
00:19:46.526,00:19:47.903,00:00:01.377,,,,,"and you keep the seven on the bottom"
00:19:49.010,00:19:51.594,00:00:02.584,,,,,"and then you do the same thing we've been doing with all of them"
00:19:51.594,00:19:55.376,00:00:03.782,,,,,"you just multiply negative eighty-six by seven divided by thirteen"
00:19:59.706,00:20:01.133,00:00:01.427,,,,"divided by thirteen",
00:20:01.282,00:20:01.532,00:00:00.250,,,,,"yeah"
00:20:04.226,00:20:05.732,00:00:01.506,,,,"it's six",
00:20:06.820,00:20:07.209,00:00:00.389,,,,,"awesome"
00:20:18.563,00:20:19.100,00:00:00.537,,,,,"oh there we go okay so"
00:20:23.047,00:20:25.163,00:00:02.116,,,,,"okay this is yeah okay"
00:20:28.224,00:20:29.013,00:00:00.789,,,,,"so let's see"
00:20:32.711,00:20:36.003,00:00:03.292,,,,,"so this is eleven over one"
00:20:36.393,00:20:48.333,00:00:11.940,,,,,"just to make that that's also thirty-three over three if you want to have it for this three over here"
00:21:17.775,00:21:27.523,00:00:09.748,,,,"what in the world so three seventeen on both sides",
00:21:30.811,00:21:48.905,00:00:18.094,,,,,"okay so you have on this side negative one hundred minus eleven x equals ten over three x"
00:22:00.511,00:22:13.039,00:00:12.528,,,,,"okay so you can't do that because one hundred doesn't have I'm sorry one hundred doesn't have an x connected to it"
00:22:16.708,00:22:21.716,00:00:05.008,,,,,"so you want to get this over that side"
00:22:23.489,00:22:28.598,00:00:05.109,,,,,"so you would add put that to both sides"
00:22:32.519,00:22:41.638,00:00:09.119,,,,,"and remember this eleven is also thirty-three over three"
00:22:41.638,00:22:43.015,00:00:01.377,,,,,"so you can add it to that"
00:22:48.253,00:22:49.779,00:00:01.526,,,,"this it's very confusing",
00:22:51.196,00:23:08.966,00:00:17.770,,,,,"yeah ten over three x plus"
00:23:10.153,00:23:11.829,00:00:01.676,,,,"you said you go to (inaudible) right",
00:23:11.829,00:23:12.119,00:00:00.290,,,,,"yeah"
00:23:13.046,00:23:17.637,00:00:04.591,,,,"did you all have a carwash the last Sunday I mean the last Saturday",
00:23:18.362,00:23:20.165,00:00:01.803,,,,,"did we"
00:23:20.689,00:23:22.256,00:00:01.567,,,,"they said a sophomore carwashed",
00:23:23.183,00:23:23.882,00:00:00.699,,,,,"I have no idea"
00:23:36.858,00:23:38.889,00:00:02.031,,,,,"x and then that's a plus"
00:23:39.696,00:23:41.681,00:00:01.985,,,,"this time would face",
00:23:42.110,00:23:48.436,00:00:06.326,,,,,"oh yeah huh thirty-three over three x"
00:23:49.755,00:23:50.645,00:00:00.890,,,,,"so can we do that"
00:23:51.795,00:23:54.078,00:00:02.283,,,,"thirty-three times x thirty-three times",
00:23:54.913,00:23:58.822,00:00:03.909,,,,,"that's ten over three x plus thirty-three over three x"
00:24:01.466,00:24:05.278,00:00:03.812,,,,"three goes into ten three times",
00:24:05.747,00:24:06.984,00:00:01.237,,,,,"no it's just plus"
00:24:08.610,00:24:12.142,00:00:03.532,,,,,"so you just get forty-three over three x"
00:24:13.379,00:24:14.018,00:00:00.639,,,,"that's the answer",
00:24:14.816,00:24:27.787,00:00:12.971,,,,,"and also you have negative one hundred equals forty-three over three x"
00:24:29.862,00:24:40.627,00:00:10.765,,,,,"and then you multiply it at this I mean you divide this by forty-three over three"
00:24:40.627,00:24:43.381,00:00:02.754,,,,,"and you have negative one hundred"
00:24:44.401,00:24:46.454,00:00:02.053,,,,,"and that's negative one hundred I promise"
00:24:46.504,00:24:47.362,00:00:00.858,,,,,"oh Jesus"
00:24:48.220,00:24:49.727,00:00:01.507,,,,,"is it possible to write with these"
00:24:53.881,00:25:03.635,00:00:09.754,,,,,"so one hundred times that's times three over"
00:25:04.284,00:25:05.720,00:00:01.436,,,,"they're coming to you right now",
00:25:06.179,00:25:06.196,00:00:00.017,,,"all right it's time",,
