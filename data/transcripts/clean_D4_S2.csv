7,4,2,00:08:18.936,00:08:19.343,00:00:00.407,okay then,
8,4,2,00:08:21.413,00:08:24.509,00:00:03.096,so pause filler okay yeah,
9,4,2,00:08:27.006,00:08:31.000,00:00:03.994,pause filler you would divide by three sevenths,
10,4,2,00:08:36.025,00:08:36.770,00:00:00.745,,pause filler
11,4,2,00:08:41.030,00:08:42.573,00:00:01.543,,pause filler multiply by seven-thirds
12,4,2,00:08:43.733,00:08:45.980,00:00:02.247,yeah so multiply by the seven thirds,
13,4,2,00:08:46.235,00:08:49.121,00:00:02.886,pause filler divide by three sevenths,
14,4,2,00:08:50.369,00:08:55.452,00:00:05.083,pause filler forty so x equals forty times seven thirds,
15,4,2,00:08:55.566,00:08:56.057,00:00:00.491,pause filler forty times seven is pause filler two hundred eighty,
16,4,2,00:08:57.044,00:08:58.636,00:00:01.592,forty times seven is,
17,4,2,00:08:59.299,00:09:01.222,00:00:01.923,pause filler forty times seven is pause filler two hundred eighty,
18,4,2,00:09:01.331,00:09:02.242,00:00:00.911,divided by three,
19,4,2,00:09:03.662,00:09:04.992,00:00:01.330,two hundred eighty thirds,
20,4,2,00:09:15.081,00:09:15.861,00:00:00.780,,yeah that's right
21,4,2,00:09:16.401,00:09:16.635,00:00:00.234,yeah,

24,4,2,00:09:24.323,00:09:32.929,00:00:08.606,times eight thirds,
25,4,2,00:09:34.204,00:09:37.897,00:00:03.693,okay pause filler fourteen times eight is eighty,
26,4,2,00:09:38.386,00:09:41.335,00:00:02.949,plus thirty-two,
27,4,2,00:09:41.335,00:09:42.744,00:00:01.409,so a hundred twelve,
28,4,2,00:09:44.424,00:09:44.624,00:00:00.200,,yeah
29,4,2,00:09:45.146,00:09:45.333,00:00:00.187,okay,
30,4,2,00:09:46.610,00:09:50.740,00:00:04.130,and twelve thirds equals okay,
31,4,2,00:09:57.858,00:09:58.242,00:00:00.384,all right,
32,4,2,00:09:59.836,00:10:00.683,00:00:00.847,negative two-thirds,
33,4,2,00:10:08.377,00:10:10.564,00:00:02.187,pause filler you add eighteen you add eighteen,
34,4,2,00:10:10.598,00:10:12.355,00:00:01.757,you get sixty seventy,
35,4,2,00:10:17.902,00:10:18.867,00:00:00.965,pause filler and now you have two thirds,
36,4,2,00:10:18.875,00:10:25.326,00:00:06.451,so times y equals negative one,
37,4,2,00:10:30.112,00:10:30.622,00:00:00.510,,that's good
38,4,2,00:10:36.952,00:10:51.047,00:00:14.095,(inaudible) fifty-seven,
39,4,2,00:11:07.095,00:11:12.827,00:00:05.732,pause filler yeah I think it's a hundred and fourteen,
40,4,2,00:11:16.066,00:11:16.355,00:00:00.289,,yeah
41,4,2,00:11:21.938,00:11:24.555,00:00:02.617,okay thirty-one equals,

43,4,2,00:11:27.851,00:11:30.827,00:00:02.976,you got forty fourty seven,
44,4,2,00:11:40.419,00:11:41.229,00:00:00.810,multiply it by two,
45,4,2,00:11:41.238,00:11:42.238,00:00:01.000,you get eighty,
46,4,2,00:11:46.275,00:11:47.100,00:00:00.825,no you don't get eighty,
47,4,2,00:11:47.120,00:11:49.060,00:00:01.940,you got ninety-four,
48,4,2,00:11:51.650,00:11:51.999,00:00:00.349,there we go,
49,4,2,00:11:52.666,00:11:53.564,00:00:00.898,,that's good
50,4,2,00:12:02.420,00:12:06.590,00:00:04.170,pause filler ninety-seven minus forty-eight,
51,4,2,00:12:06.590,00:12:08.340,00:00:01.750,pause filler fifty,
52,4,2,00:12:10.011,00:12:10.957,00:00:00.946,forty-nine,
53,4,2,00:12:13.601,00:12:16.415,00:00:02.814,forty-nine equals,
54,4,2,00:12:18.182,00:12:21.196,00:00:03.014,negative twelve fifths,
55,4,2,00:12:23.966,00:12:25.177,00:00:01.211,that's a bad number,
56,4,2,00:12:27.830,00:12:31.915,00:00:04.085,pause filler forty-nine times negative twelve fifths is,
57,4,2,00:12:46.110,00:12:48.500,00:00:02.390,pause filler forty-nine,
58,4,2,00:12:48.815,00:12:49.991,00:00:01.176,this is right,
59,4,2,00:12:50.084,00:12:52.195,00:00:02.111,but I'm just not sure how to reduce it,
60,4,2,00:12:52.195,00:12:53.957,00:00:01.762,what's forty-nine times twelve,
61,4,2,00:12:53.567,00:12:55.330,00:00:01.763,,forty-nine minus twelve
62,4,2,00:12:55.559,00:12:58.923,00:00:03.364,pause filler times times negative twelve pause filler,
63,4,2,00:12:59.703,00:13:00.745,00:00:01.042,,pause filler I see it
64,4,2,00:13:01.432,00:13:07.288,00:00:05.856,pause filler four hundred ninety plus twenty ninety twenty,
65,4,2,00:13:07.737,00:13:08.627,00:00:00.890,four and a half,
66,4,2,00:13:09.169,00:13:11.711,00:00:02.542,it's like approximately five hundred,
67,4,2,00:13:13.813,00:13:17.847,00:00:04.034,pause filler y equals five hundred,
68,4,2,00:13:17.856,00:13:21.983,00:00:04.127,pause filler I think it's five hundred fourteen and a half,
69,4,2,00:13:25.457,00:13:26.025,00:00:00.568,,negative
70,4,2,00:13:27.067,00:13:28.754,00:00:01.687,negative five hundred fourteen and a half,
71,4,2,00:13:29.542,00:13:30.245,00:00:00.703,there we go,
72,4,2,00:13:36.474,00:13:37.524,00:00:01.050,,And then over five
73,4,2,00:13:38.220,00:13:38.550,00:00:00.330,oh yeah,

80,4,2,00:13:52.254,00:13:54.890,00:00:02.636,pause filler oh you have to,
81,4,2,00:13:52.289,00:13:52.546,00:00:00.257,,pause filler
82,4,2,00:13:54.953,00:13:55.617,00:00:00.664,darn it,
83,4,2,00:13:56.062,00:13:58.851,00:00:02.789,I want to just multiply by the variables and get rid of them,
84,4,2,00:13:59.828,00:14:02.726,00:00:02.898,but negative six sevenths,
85,4,2,00:14:02.875,00:14:05.453,00:00:02.578,pause filler y plus yz,
86,4,2,00:14:05.453,00:14:07.234,00:00:01.781,subtract negative six-sevens,
87,4,2,00:14:07.234,00:14:12.750,00:00:05.516,minus sixty-one equals twenty-five because you subtract the y from both sides,
88,4,2,00:14:12.750,00:14:14.187,00:00:01.437,you get rid of that y,
89,4,2,00:14:14.291,00:14:14.461,00:00:00.170,,yeah
90,4,2,00:14:16.164,00:14:16.437,00:00:00.273,I think,
91,4,2,00:14:19.205,00:14:19.386,00:00:00.181,yeah,
92,4,2,00:14:32.174,00:14:34.932,00:00:02.758,pause filler wait I did something wrong,
93,4,2,00:14:37.120,00:14:37.684,00:00:00.564,,yeah
94,4,2,00:14:38.221,00:14:39.056,00:00:00.835,pause filler you don't,
95,4,2,00:14:39.123,00:14:40.952,00:00:01.829,you move the sixty-one first but,
96,4,2,00:14:42.643,00:14:44.915,00:00:02.272,oh I bet yeah you move the sixty-one first,
97,4,2,00:14:44.939,00:14:45.499,00:00:00.560,it's not in,
98,4,2,00:14:45.768,00:14:50.325,00:00:04.557,pause filler if you move the variables it's okay,
99,4,2,00:14:51.556,00:14:57.419,00:00:05.863,pause filler tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap,
100,4,2,00:14:57.878,00:15:06.956,00:00:09.078,okay it's negative six sevenths y equals pause filler twenty-five,
101,4,2,00:15:06.969,00:15:08.929,00:00:01.960,plus sixty-one is eight-six,
102,4,2,00:15:09.093,00:15:11.919,00:00:02.826,eighty-six plus y,
103,4,2,00:15:13.244,00:15:26.737,00:00:13.493,pause filler moving to the other side oh because it's not oh it's negative one seventh y equals eighty-six,
104,4,2,00:15:26.825,00:15:28.281,00:00:01.456,okay that's yeah,
105,4,2,00:15:28.452,00:15:29.056,00:00:00.604,,mm-hmm
106,4,2,00:15:34.133,00:15:34.444,00:00:00.311,,oh
107,4,2,00:15:35.742,00:15:37.023,00:00:01.281,add eighty-three,
108,4,2,00:15:37.060,00:15:37.982,00:00:00.922,get a hundred,
109,4,2,00:15:38.412,00:15:43.207,00:00:04.795,so negative eleven x equals one hundred,
110,4,2,00:15:45.083,00:15:54.167,00:00:09.084,pause filler plus ten thirds x pause filler ten thirds eleven,
111,4,2,00:15:54.764,00:15:58.758,00:00:03.994,so pause filler negative thirty-three thirds x,
112,4,2,00:15:58.828,00:16:03.888,00:00:05.060,pause filler move over there thirty-three thirds,
113,4,2,00:16:03.976,00:16:05.778,00:00:01.802,okay oh on I have to,
114,4,2,00:16:05.909,00:16:07.714,00:00:01.805,okay all right,
115,4,2,00:16:07.828,00:16:09.566,00:00:01.738,pause filler negative,
116,4,2,00:16:09.996,00:16:17.080,00:00:07.084,pause filler forty-three thirds x equals a hundred,
117,4,2,00:16:18.469,00:16:21.382,00:00:02.913,and then you get x equals,
118,4,2,00:16:22.365,00:16:25.019,00:00:02.654,pause filler you multiply the reciprocal,
119,4,2,00:16:25.281,00:16:34.409,00:00:09.128,you get three hundred negative three hundred forty-thirds,
120,4,2,00:16:37.362,00:16:37.583,00:00:00.221,,yeah
121,4,2,00:16:38.039,00:16:42.533,00:00:04.494,okay,
122,4,2,00:16:44.875,00:16:48.715,00:00:03.840,pause filler nineteen fourths,
123,4,2,00:16:49.870,00:16:56.376,00:00:06.506,pause filler fifty-five or thirty-four,
124,4,2,00:16:56.597,00:16:58.859,00:00:02.262,so you subtract thirty-four from the side,
125,4,2,00:16:59.142,00:17:00.343,00:00:01.201,you cancel thirty-four,
126,4,2,00:17:00.681,00:17:03.840,00:00:03.159,pause filler fifty-five minus thirty-four is twenty-five,
127,4,2,00:17:03.910,00:17:05.121,00:00:01.211,minus twenty-one,
128,4,2,00:17:05.165,00:17:09.662,00:00:04.497,so you have nineteen fourths y,
129,4,2,00:17:10.732,00:17:20.407,00:00:09.675,plus twenty-one equals fourteen y fourths,
130,4,2,00:17:20.490,00:17:21.904,00:00:01.414,pause filler nineteen fourths y,
131,4,2,00:17:21.904,00:17:22.496,00:00:00.592,you move that,
132,4,2,00:17:22.515,00:17:24.089,00:00:01.574,you subtract nineteen fourths y,
133,4,2,00:17:24.191,00:17:27.394,00:00:03.203,fourteen times four is,
134,4,2,00:17:27.464,00:17:34.528,00:00:07.064,pause filler fourteen times four is fifty-six fourths,
135,4,2,00:17:35.044,00:17:38.331,00:00:03.287,so nineteen plus fifty-six is,
136,4,2,00:17:38.369,00:17:47.312,00:00:08.943,pause filler nineteen fifty-six is sixty-six plus nine is pause filler seventy-five,
137,4,2,00:17:47.312,00:17:54.108,00:00:06.796,so you have twenty-one equals seventy-five fourths of y,
138,4,2,00:17:56.070,00:17:56.675,00:00:00.605,and then you get,
139,4,2,00:17:57.719,00:17:58.605,00:00:00.886,did I do something wrong,
140,4,2,00:17:59.312,00:18:01.038,00:00:01.726,,no no you didn't
141,4,2,00:18:01.036,00:18:01.299,00:00:00.263,okay,
142,4,2,00:18:05.023,00:18:10.241,00:00:05.218,x equals y y,
143,4,2,00:18:13.023,00:18:14.827,00:00:01.804,,that's an interestingy
144,4,2,00:18:14.365,00:18:17.698,00:00:03.333,it is very interesting,
145,4,2,00:18:17.777,00:18:23.321,00:00:05.544,pause filler two hundred two,
146,4,2,00:18:23.620,00:18:40.264,00:00:16.644,see at a hundred and forty-two one hundred forty-two plus seventy-six x equals fifty fourteenths x,
147,4,2,00:18:40.264,00:18:44.074,00:00:03.810,pause filler you move the seventy-seven get,
148,4,2,00:18:44.074,00:18:49.716,00:00:05.642,pause filler fifty fourteen six three pause filler seventy-seven times fourteen,
149,4,2,00:18:49.722,00:18:50.922,00:00:01.200,oh jeez,
150,4,2,00:18:50.922,00:19:02.941,00:00:12.019,pause filler seven hundred seventy plus oh jeez seventy-seven times four is twenty twenty two hundred eighty three hundred eight,
151,4,2,00:19:02.941,00:19:06.051,00:00:03.110,so like a thousand seventy-eight,
152,4,2,00:19:07.386,00:19:12.854,00:00:05.468,pause filler one four two equals a thousand seventy-eight,
153,4,2,00:19:12.861,00:19:15.642,00:00:02.781,plus fifty a thousand and one,
154,4,2,00:19:15.642,00:19:25.518,00:00:09.876,okay one two or no one one two eight fourteenths x,
155,4,2,00:19:25.518,00:19:34.715,00:00:09.197,and then one forty-two times fourteen equals one,
156,4,2,00:19:34.715,00:19:39.477,00:00:04.762,one two eight equals x,
157,4,2,00:19:41.701,00:19:43.671,00:00:01.970,I really don't want to reduce that number,
158,4,2,00:19:44.910,00:19:46.492,00:00:01.582,but it's pause filler,
159,4,2,00:19:47.014,00:19:49.768,00:00:02.754,,one forty-two times fourteen
160,4,2,00:19:49.768,00:19:50.746,00:00:00.978,,and then you're good
161,4,2,00:19:51.537,00:19:56.806,00:00:05.269,yeah pause filler one forty-two times fourteen is one thousand four hundred twenty,
162,4,2,00:19:57.597,00:20:00.940,00:00:03.343,pause filler one thousand four hundred twenty plus,
163,4,2,00:20:00.940,00:20:14.701,00:00:13.761,pause filler four hundred five hundred sixty five hundred sixty-eight one thousand four hundred twenty-five sixteenth plus four hundred twenty pause filler (inaudible),
164,4,2,00:20:15.522,00:20:21.507,00:00:05.985,one thousand nine hundred eighty,
165,4,2,00:20:21.522,00:20:34.403,00:00:12.881,so it's like one thousand nine hundred eighty-eight over one one two eight equals x,
166,4,2,00:20:35.274,00:20:35.441,00:00:00.167,yeah,
167,4,2,00:20:37.096,00:20:38.045,00:00:00.949,stop come and get,

169,4,2,00:21:19.299,00:21:24.350,00:00:05.051,all right then twenty-two y minus ninety,
170,4,2,00:21:24.350,00:21:26.135,00:00:01.785,pause filler you add ninety to both sides,
171,4,2,00:21:26.135,00:21:33.909,00:00:07.774,you get twenty-two y equals fifteen fourths of y,
172,4,2,00:21:34.756,00:21:39.819,00:00:05.063,plus pause filler forty-seven,
173,4,2,00:21:43.610,00:21:45.994,00:00:02.384,pause filler twenty-two y,
174,4,2,00:21:50.079,00:21:53.621,00:00:03.542,pause filler okay so pause filler move the fifteen fourths,
175,4,2,00:21:53.621,00:21:56.683,00:00:03.062,you get twenty-two times four,
176,4,2,00:21:56.841,00:22:02.401,00:00:05.560,eighty-eight plus fifteen plus fifteen,
177,4,2,00:22:03.779,00:22:07.982,00:00:04.203,pause filler four equals thirty-seven,
178,4,2,00:22:08.932,00:22:12.187,00:00:03.255,pause filler so eighty plus fifteen is nighty ,
179,4,2,00:22:13.056,00:22:15.090,00:00:02.034,pause filler is a hundred and three fourths,
180,4,2,00:22:19.158,00:22:20.982,00:00:01.824,equals forty minus seven,
181,4,2,00:22:22.355,00:22:23.604,00:00:01.249,oh hundred and three-fourth,
182,4,2,00:22:23.977,00:22:24.982,00:00:01.005,,yeah y
183,4,2,00:22:24.310,00:22:25.265,00:00:00.955,y equals forty-seven,
184,4,2,00:22:26.570,00:22:28.288,00:00:01.718,and then oh jeez ,
185,4,2,00:22:30.203,00:22:31.932,00:00:01.729,pause filler you move that over there,
186,4,2,00:22:32.293,00:22:36.609,00:00:04.316,pause filler forty-seven times four is,
187,4,2,00:22:36.609,00:22:37.787,00:00:01.178,so y,
188,4,2,00:22:38.694,00:22:44.495,00:00:05.801,y equals pause filler one hundred-thirds,
189,4,2,00:22:47.373,00:22:53.083,00:00:05.710,four pause filler four times forty-seven six,
190,4,2,00:22:53.083,00:22:55.747,00:00:02.664,one hundred sixty plus twenty one,
191,4,2,00:22:55.747,00:22:57.252,00:00:01.505,hundred eighty-eight,
192,4,2,00:22:58.978,00:22:59.178,00:00:00.200,,okay
193,4,2,00:23:00.728,00:23:01.476,00:00:00.748,next page,
194,4,2,00:23:04.392,00:23:08.794,00:00:04.402,ninety-nine plus thirteen equals three hundred thirteen,
195,4,2,00:23:09.280,00:23:12.859,00:00:03.579,okay pause filler add ninety-nine to both sides,
196,4,2,00:23:12.897,00:23:21.242,00:00:08.345,you get thirteen x equals three hundred thirteen plus ninety-nine is four hundred,
197,4,2,00:23:22.354,00:23:29.289,00:00:06.935,pause filler four hundred times twelve,
198,4,2,00:23:30.327,00:23:33.289,00:00:02.962,twenty-two plus nine is eleven,
199,4,2,00:23:34.308,00:23:39.420,00:00:05.112,so four hundred and twelve I think,
200,4,2,00:23:39.868,00:23:40.280,00:00:00.412,,mm-hmm
201,4,2,00:23:40.747,00:23:45.242,00:00:04.495,okay oh that equal sign should be there,
202,4,2,00:23:45.467,00:23:57.317,00:00:11.850,it's now plus pause filler plus four thirteenths x,
203,4,2,00:23:57.868,00:23:59.840,00:00:01.972,pause filler you move that to the other side,
204,4,2,00:23:59.840,00:24:03.270,00:00:03.430,you multiply thirteen by thirteen which is a hundred sixty-nine,
205,4,2,00:24:05.495,00:24:07.457,00:00:01.962,so you have a hundred sixty-nine,
206,4,2,00:24:07.597,00:24:10.364,00:00:02.767,pause filler oh god plus four pause filler,
207,4,2,00:24:10.766,00:24:15.065,00:00:04.299,so a hundred and seventy pause filler three,
208,4,2,00:24:17.439,00:24:20.345,00:00:02.906,pause filler it's just clear some of these numbers,
209,4,2,00:24:25.308,00:24:26.728,00:00:01.420,there you go oh one more,
210,4,2,00:24:28.457,00:24:31.738,00:00:03.281,okay a hundred seventy-three x,
211,4,2,00:24:34.018,00:24:43.420,00:00:09.402,over thirteen equals pause filler four hundred and twelve,
212,4,2,00:24:44.953,00:24:53.065,00:00:08.112,(sfx) pause filler four hundred twelve times thirteen is four thousand one hundred twenty,
213,4,2,00:24:53.654,00:25:09.691,00:00:16.037,plus pause filler six thirty and twelve four six five three five three five six,
214,4,2,00:25:10.541,00:25:17.439,00:00:06.898,so x equals one hundred seventy-three five three five sixes,
215,4,2,00:25:19.140,00:25:19.616,00:00:00.476,,okay
216,4,2,00:25:26.493,00:25:27.784,00:00:01.291,one fifteenths of x,
217,4,2,00:25:28.999,00:25:29.495,00:00:00.496,just cancel,
218,4,2,00:25:32.588,00:25:34.822,00:00:02.234,pause filler really they shouldn't cancel,
219,4,2,00:25:35.121,00:25:36.822,00:00:01.701,but I'll solve the equation anyways,
220,4,2,00:25:37.280,00:25:44.999,00:00:07.719,pause filler so one fifteenths of x equals fifteen x,
221,4,2,00:25:45.915,00:25:53.298,00:00:07.383,plus pause filler one hundred and thirty-five,
222,4,2,00:25:55.981,00:25:57.579,00:00:01.598,so you move the fifteen x,
223,4,2,00:25:58.083,00:26:00.560,00:00:02.477,pause filler you divide by fifteen x,
224,4,2,00:26:02.710,00:26:04.831,00:00:02.121,divided by fifteen x,
225,4,2,00:26:05.831,00:26:11.504,00:00:05.673,pause filler fifteen divided by one fifteenth divided by one,
226,4,2,00:26:16.749,00:26:21.203,00:00:04.454,,you just have to multiply the reciprocal
227,4,2,00:26:19.580,00:26:26.287,00:00:06.707,okay so you oh so you don't oh my god these are like hugely yeah okay yeah,
228,4,2,00:26:26.128,00:26:27.445,00:00:01.317,,so instead of one hundred
229,4,2,00:26:27.454,00:26:33.239,00:00:05.785,fifteen times fifteen is two hundred twenty-five isn't it yeah,
230,4,2,00:26:32.814,00:26:34.406,00:00:01.592,,one wait pause filler
231,4,2,00:26:35.113,00:26:37.125,00:00:02.012,because you multiply by the reciprocal,
232,4,2,00:26:37.125,00:26:38.933,00:00:01.808,so you get one pause filler over fifty,
233,4,2,00:26:38.933,00:26:44.868,00:00:05.935,times fifteen x equals one thirty-five,
234,4,2,00:26:44.874,00:26:45.921,00:00:01.047,so you get x,
235,4,2,00:26:48.305,00:26:51.496,00:00:03.191,x equals pause filler one,
236,4,2,00:26:54.586,00:27:03.802,00:00:09.216,oh my god one thirty-five times,
237,4,2,00:27:04.682,00:27:10.802,00:00:06.120,oh okay so you get pause filler five twenty-five pause filler,
238,4,2,00:27:11.011,00:27:12.999,00:00:01.988,five times two is ten,
239,4,2,00:27:14.933,00:27:17.353,00:00:02.420,ten pause filler is ten,
240,4,2,00:27:17.993,00:27:19.347,00:00:01.354,so you get that,
241,4,2,00:27:19.927,00:27:22.059,00:00:02.132,then you get times zero,
242,4,2,00:27:22.359,00:27:30.047,00:00:07.688,you get pause filler three times five is fifteen,
243,4,2,00:27:30.945,00:27:32.508,00:00:01.563,pause filler three times two is six,
244,4,2,00:27:32.562,00:27:33.736,00:00:01.174,but you have the actual ones,
245,4,2,00:27:33.736,00:27:34.251,00:00:00.515,so seven,
246,4,2,00:27:34.251,00:27:37.646,00:00:03.395,you get six oh one times,
247,4,2,00:27:37.987,00:27:41.520,00:00:03.533,then you get five five two,
248,4,2,00:27:42.820,00:27:43.341,00:00:00.521,add all that up,
249,4,2,00:27:43.442,00:27:45.017,00:00:01.575,you get five seven,
250,4,2,00:27:45.951,00:27:52.891,00:00:06.940,yeah thirteen and a thirteen and a one,
251,4,2,00:27:53.239,00:27:53.730,00:00:00.491,you get three,
252,4,2,00:27:54.670,00:28:03.592,00:00:08.922,so x equals pause filler three three three seven five,
253,4,2,00:28:03.712,00:28:04.969,00:00:01.257,oh so that looks really bad,
254,4,2,00:28:05.221,00:28:06.897,00:00:01.676,two hundred and twenty fifths,
255,4,2,00:28:09.850,00:28:16.442,00:00:06.592,,okay oh
256,4,2,00:28:17.484,00:28:20.969,00:00:03.485,all right pause filler that's actually much nicer fraction than everything else,
257,4,2,00:28:21.634,00:28:23.311,00:00:01.677,so you move the two ninety-two,
258,4,2,00:28:23.520,00:28:29.820,00:00:06.300,you get twenty-nine x equals,
259,4,2,00:28:29.856,00:28:34.353,00:00:04.497,pause filler negative two hundred ninety,
260,4,2,00:28:39.035,00:28:45.975,00:00:06.940,plus pause filler two ninths x,
261,4,2,00:28:48.155,00:28:51.128,00:00:02.973,or pause filler you move that,
262,4,2,00:28:51.128,00:28:53.963,00:00:02.835,you get twenty-nine point,
263,4,2,00:28:54.149,00:28:55.101,00:00:00.952,or no you subtract it,
264,4,2,00:28:55.167,00:28:58.712,00:00:03.545,so you get twenty pause filler,
265,4,2,00:29:06.006,00:29:06.247,00:00:00.241,okay,
266,4,2,00:35:14.178,00:35:15.178,00:00:01.000,,(inaudible)
267,4,2,00:35:57.304,00:35:58.701,00:00:01.397,,oh yeah are you going to
268,4,2,00:36:06.435,00:36:08.371,00:00:01.936,,okay so okay
269,4,2,00:36:13.263,00:36:21.052,00:00:07.789,,equal to twenty-five over one
270,4,2,00:36:23.290,00:36:24.521,00:00:01.231,,oh wait all right
271,4,2,00:36:30.319,00:36:33.319,00:00:03.000,,oh pause filler I see
272,4,2,00:36:33.797,00:36:35.058,00:00:01.261,you can solve it that way,
273,4,2,00:36:35.188,00:36:37.753,00:00:02.565,I just don't think that's the way they intended it to be solved,
274,4,2,00:36:38.681,00:36:39.927,00:00:01.246,but yeah it's possible,
275,4,2,00:36:40.232,00:36:40.797,00:00:00.565,,okay
276,4,2,00:36:55.014,00:37:00.579,00:00:05.565,,x is equal to that number ditto
277,4,2,00:37:04.913,00:37:06.710,00:00:01.797,,oh oh
278,4,2,00:37:08.043,00:37:19.290,00:00:11.247,,okay so negative three over y plus negative seventeen is equal to sixty-three
279,4,2,00:37:21.550,00:37:23.203,00:00:01.653,,plus seventeen
280,4,2,00:37:27.579,00:37:31.434,00:00:03.855,,plus three over y is equal to
281,4,2,00:37:36.652,00:37:40.855,00:00:04.203,,eighty and then
282,4,2,00:37:45.997,00:37:52.534,00:00:06.537,,pause filler
283,4,2,00:38:06.739,00:38:12.565,00:00:05.826,,okay pause filler let's cancel out
284,4,2,00:38:12.855,00:38:13.942,00:00:01.087,,y is equal to
285,4,2,00:38:14.203,00:38:15.275,00:00:01.072,pause filler hold on,
286,4,2,00:38:15.840,00:38:18.174,00:00:02.334,I don't think multiplying by three works,
287,4,2,00:38:19.029,00:38:23.898,00:00:04.869,because don't you have to multiply it by y because y is what's three is being divided by,
288,4,2,00:38:28.797,00:38:29.319,00:00:00.522,,probably
289,4,2,00:38:31.739,00:38:34.463,00:00:02.724,,that's eighty pause filler
290,4,2,00:38:35.782,00:38:37.478,00:00:01.696,pause filler so yeah,
291,4,2,00:38:41.985,00:38:47.637,00:00:05.652,,pause filler
292,4,2,00:39:01.261,00:39:03.942,00:00:02.681,,negative three equals y
293,4,2,00:39:05.565,00:39:26.087,00:00:20.522,,so I'll multiply by y over negative three
294,4,2,00:39:27.072,00:39:30.840,00:00:03.768,pause filler multiply it by y over negative three,
295,4,2,00:39:31.246,00:39:32.681,00:00:01.435,pause filler that would cancel the entire thing,
296,4,2,00:39:32.681,00:39:34.710,00:00:02.029,I think you can just multiply it by y,
297,4,2,00:39:36.434,00:39:38.971,00:00:02.537,and move pause filler the lower half over,
298,4,2,00:39:38.985,00:39:41.666,00:00:02.681,so you get pause filler negative three equals,
299,4,2,00:39:41.927,00:39:45.884,00:00:03.957,,oh wait I'm (inaudible)
