10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:20.600000,00:09:23.900000,pause filler so do you see the x minus x equals thirteen,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:24.400000,00:09:26.400000,,yup I see it same place you are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:26.400000,00:09:31.700000,I'm guessing this is a question we're working on and I thought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:31.700000,00:09:33.600000,,yup pause filler just don't push the button,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:33.700000,00:09:34.800000,,that's all I was told,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,

10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:38.200000,00:09:39.100000,just solve the problem (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:39.300000,00:09:44,so I have no idea how to explain this (laughter),,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:47.600000,00:09:48.700000,,so just do your best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:49.800000,00:09:53,what I know and do for this is just do the opposite (laughter),,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:54.300000,00:09:57.600000,so like if you do x minus six this is thirteen plus six,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:57.600000,00:09:58.100000,that's the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:58.700000,00:10:02.500000,,okay like the opposite operation all right should I do this,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:10:02.700000,00:10:04.100000,,or should you do this,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:10:05,00:10:05.300000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:10:05.700000,00:10:08.900000,it's just a thirteen plus six I mean,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:10:09,00:10:12.600000,,this is hard to draw plus six okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:10:12.900000,00:10:16,no that is okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:10:17.100000,00:10:24.100000,,plus six so that would mean x equal to,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:10:24.100000,00:10:27.800000,,that was a really bad equal to sign,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:10:27.800000,00:10:29.500000,,I don't know what that is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,

10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:10:36.800000,00:10:43,,that's not a nine one minute okay wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:43,00:10:45.300000,,this is confusing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:45.900000,00:10:49.400000,,okay I think I got it now nineteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:49.400000,00:10:51.200000,,there's my sloppy answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:51.800000,00:10:55.200000,so then you can like double check it by nineteen minus six equals,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:55.800000,00:10:58.200000,,yeah that's a good trick okay,,,,,,,,,,,,LPP,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:58.400000,00:11:00.200000,,so I guess we'll move onto the next page now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:11:00.200000,00:11:01.300000,I suppose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:11:01.300000,00:11:03.800000,so let's see if I can do that while messing out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:11:01.400000,00:13:08.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:11:04.200000,00:11:05.200000,,okay I'm on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:11:05.800000,00:11:07.400000,yeah I'm trying to get down good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:11:07.500000,00:11:08.900000,I am not good at this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:11:09.200000,00:11:12.100000,,okay just like okay do you see it,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:11:12.100000,00:11:21.500000,,fifteen equals negative eight plus p or a q whatever,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:11:24.500000,00:11:25.200000,so (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:11:25.200000,00:11:28.100000,,are you on the first page or the second page,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:11:28.100000,00:11:30.800000,second I see fifteen equals minus eight equals p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:11:31.300000,00:11:31.500000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:11:34.100000,00:11:49.700000,so I'm guessing I'll do achy nose achy nose ah (laughter) so just that like minus eight to each side I think,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:11:49.700000,00:11:49.800000,,oh yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:11:50,00:11:53.400000,that's what I'm doing here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:11:53.400000,00:11:57,,well at least minus negative eight yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:11:57.200000,00:12:00.500000,yeah so add negative eight to both I suppose,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:12:01,00:12:04.500000,,yeah which is just basically just adding the (inaudible) no right,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:12:04.500000,00:12:06.100000,or no add eight to each,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:12:06.300000,00:12:09.200000,because eight minus eight equals eight equals zero so,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:12:09.700000,00:12:14.600000,,so plus yeah because it should not be those like a positive,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:12:14.600000,00:12:15.300000,,I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:12:15.800000,00:12:16.600000,,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:12:16.600000,00:12:19.700000,over or just a regular number plus a negative,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:12:20.100000,00:12:29.400000,,yeah well if you're subtracting wait one second yeah because we're subtracting negative eight,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:12:29.600000,00:12:37.300000,,which would make it just adding eight pause filler plus eight plus eight,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:12:37.300000,00:12:39.500000,what did you do to that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:12:40.400000,00:12:45.200000,,so that would make this side just p,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:12:46.400000,00:12:50.500000,,and oh jeez this is confusing okay,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:12:51.100000,00:12:59.700000,,and that would make this side ninety-three right yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:13:01,00:13:04.700000,yeah (laughter) the mental math there for a second,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:13:04.700000,00:13:07.200000,,I'm really about it for some reason,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:13:20.400000,00:13:21.700000,because you're trying to find the k,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:13:21.900000,00:13:25,like what plus eleven would equal seventeen,,,,RS,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:13:25.500000,00:13:25.900000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:13:26.400000,00:13:28.100000,so seventeen minus eleven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:13:29.100000,00:13:29.500000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:13:29.500000,00:13:31,then eleven minus eleven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:13:32,00:13:34.200000,,yeah I would just do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:13:34.200000,00:13:45.900000,,you do one side to do on another side minus eleven to the side equals k,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:14:17.800000,00:14:19.200000,,is this like forty-four yeah,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:14:19.400000,00:14:20.800000,,and this looks to be an x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:14:21.200000,00:14:25,forty-four x or forty-times one equals,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:14:36.500000,00:14:37.500000,they don't use a sign,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:14:39.200000,00:14:40.600000,they put the letters together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:14:40.600000,00:14:45.300000,so that's forty-four x equals forty-time whatever,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:14:45.300000,00:14:50,it equal so two hundred and twenty divided by forty-four pretty much,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:14:56.300000,00:14:57.300000,I just used the opposite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:14:57.300000,00:15:00.200000,because the opposite of multiplication is division I mean,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:15:00.200000,00:15:03.500000,,yeah but then you have to make sure you're doing it to both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:15:03.500000,00:15:06.700000,,because the goal is to cancel the variable out,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:23:56.300000,00:23:58.700000,,so cancel out the negative nine is what you're saying,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:23:58.700000,00:23:59.700000,yeah pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:23:59.700000,00:24:05.700000,,okay so you would do add negative nine,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:24:05.700000,00:24:12.300000,,and you have to do that to each side right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:24:12.300000,00:24:13.500000,I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:24:17.400000,00:24:22.900000,I'm looking at them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:24:22.900000,00:24:24.500000,,okay now what does it say to do,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:24:27.900000,00:24:32,I guess when you kind of divide,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:24:32,00:24:36.200000,because you're doing thirteen p which is thirteen times p,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:24:36.300000,00:24:38,,yeah so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:24:38.100000,00:24:42.500000,it's like divided by five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:24:42.500000,00:24:46.700000,or for us it would be thirteen so forty-one divided by thirteen and thirteen divided thirteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:24:46.700000,00:24:48.300000,,I'm trying to write on this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:24:50.700000,00:24:53.400000,,so that's yeah okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:24:54.600000,00:24:56.700000,,so we should probably do this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:24:57.100000,00:24:59.200000,,because I wrote it down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:24:59.200000,00:25:00.200000,,but we didn't actually do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:25:00.800000,00:25:06,,so we're left with thirteen oh my gosh,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:25:06,00:25:14.500000,,so after we do the first step you told me to do,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:14.700000,00:25:24.100000,,I get thirteen p equals forty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:24.100000,00:25:26.300000,,after that we were,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:26.800000,00:25:29.300000,well you have to add nine to forty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:29.500000,00:25:32.100000,so that would technically be fifty now,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:32.100000,00:25:32.900000,,oh right you're right,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:32.900000,00:25:36.700000,,I forgot to do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:39.600000,00:25:41.300000,,see this is what tutors are for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:41.300000,00:25:44,,it remind you skip something yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:44,00:25:50.800000,,so I'm adding negative nine which is basically just subtracting nine right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:51.800000,00:25:53.600000,well you're adding nine,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:53.600000,00:25:56.900000,because minus nine wouldn't if you subtracted it it would be,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:58.400000,00:25:59.500000,,so you want me to add nine,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:25:59.600000,00:26:03.200000,minus fifteen so minus nine plus nine and then forty-one plus nine,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:26:03.700000,00:26:04.300000,,so fifty,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:26:08.700000,00:26:11,,okay (inaudible) that to make it fifty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:26:12.600000,00:26:16.700000,,pause filler that's a really bad fifty but what we're doing and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:26:16.800000,00:26:21.400000,so then thirteen p you have to divide thirteen by forty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:26:21.900000,00:26:23.500000,,yeah this is getting really crooked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,

10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:26:32.200000,00:26:38.300000,,yeah so then that gives us p equals,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:26:38.500000,00:26:54.700000,,how many time does thirteen go into fifty and fifteen twenty-six right fifteen twenty-six thirty-nine twenty-two forty-five,,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:26:54.700000,00:26:56.200000,you can go to forty-two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:26:57.200000,00:27:02,but then if you add forty-two plus thirteen it will be forty-five so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T2,1,1.0,6,00:38:49.900000,00:38:54.400000,yay no next one I suppose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,7,00:38:55.900000,00:40:29.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,6,00:38:56.200000,00:39:02.400000,,okay so same thing go down the middle,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,6,00:39:03.200000,00:39:04.500000,,try to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,6,00:39:04.700000,00:39:14.200000,,cancel out all the pause filler numbers or I guess anything that's not a variable on this side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:14.200000,00:39:16.900000,,wait you call those constants right yeah constants,ODQ,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:16.900000,00:39:17.800000,I think so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:18.800000,00:39:20.200000,,yeah constants and variables,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:23.600000,00:39:31.100000,so we'd have to get rid of eighteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:31.600000,00:39:32.700000,eighteen's got to go,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:33.100000,00:39:37.900000,,yeah so the opposite operation so eighteen is being added which means you were,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:37.900000,00:39:40.400000,so eighteen minus eighteen equals zero,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:40.800000,00:39:45.400000,twenty-five minus eighteen equals five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:46,00:39:47.500000,,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:50.100000,00:39:51.800000,so yeah it would be five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:51.800000,00:39:54.100000,plus twenty-three minus eighteen equals five,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:39:54.800000,00:40:00.700000,,so five and I certain times like draw it on the line like that,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:40:00.700000,00:40:02.800000,,I don't know why I do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:40:03.300000,00:40:05.500000,,it's like so then to the two sides too,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,5,00:40:05.500000,00:40:13.200000,okay so eighteen minus eight eighteen or (laughter) I can't talk,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,7,00:40:14,00:40:15.200000,,so you said five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,7,00:40:15.200000,00:40:17.600000,,I guess I don't know what a negative y would be,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,7,00:40:17.600000,00:40:19.200000,,I guess it just be negative y,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,7,00:40:19.300000,00:40:22.400000,,like I don't know if you have to do anything like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,7,00:40:22.400000,00:40:28.100000,,I guess it's done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,2,1.0,7,00:40:30.100000,00:40:30.300000,so (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,6,00:40:30.300000,00:45:54.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,7,00:40:30.400000,00:40:32.300000,,are you on page three,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,7,00:40:32.700000,00:40:33.400000,yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,7,00:40:33.400000,00:40:37,,I'm confused okay let me see,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,7,00:40:38.100000,00:40:41.900000,,wait a minute okay it's not as bad as I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:40:41.900000,00:40:47.900000,,there's just a lot of negatives so oh okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:40:47.900000,00:40:53.900000,,so the other side you want me the variable on one side,,,OSQ,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:40:53.900000,00:40:54.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:40:54.700000,00:41:00.200000,,so to do that you have to what kind of sheet is that is that,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:41:00.200000,00:41:02.200000,,you have to add,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:41:02.200000,00:41:04.900000,,so see at once negative or one is a positive,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:41:06,00:41:11.600000,,so let's say if you add one to each side you cannot see that,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:41:11.600000,00:41:14.300000,,but oh well you add one to each side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:41:16.200000,00:41:19.500000,,then that's cancelling out this one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:41:20.100000,00:41:25.200000,,pause filler right here that's right yeah,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:41:25.400000,00:41:26.800000,,oh it's cancelling out this one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:41:26.800000,00:41:28.800000,,so this is like comes zero,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:41:28.800000,00:41:29.700000,,it's nothing,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:41:30.300000,00:41:33.800000,,it's just fourteen now,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:41:35.100000,00:41:39.200000,,pause filler and then this one becomes two okay,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:41:39.200000,00:41:42.300000,,and then you do it from there,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:41:42.300000,00:41:44.600000,,so I'm going to write out the problem for you now,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:41:44.700000,00:41:45.800000,,because it's all messy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:41:46.800000,00:41:55.600000,,so fourteen equals thirty-six plus two,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:41:55.600000,00:41:57,,okay so you solve that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:41:57.200000,00:42:05,should two be multiplied by k,,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:42:05,00:42:07.600000,,right now it's being multiplied by k yes so,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:42:07.600000,00:42:12.100000,I don't know how anything multiplied by how,,,AE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:42:12.100000,00:42:16.400000,it would have to be a negative number,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:42:16.400000,00:42:20.600000,because you'd have to kind of get fourteen out of thirty-six,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:42:21.800000,00:42:24.500000,,yeah do you want me to split down the middle for you,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:42:24.500000,00:42:26.100000,,I don't know if that helps you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:42:26.100000,00:42:27.400000,,but it helps me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:42:28.700000,00:42:30,,sorry if it doesn't help you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:42:30,00:42:37.500000,,it's like I always just choose a random start,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,5,00:42:37.500000,00:42:42.200000,,so you can either start out thirty-six or start at two k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:42:42.300000,00:42:47.100000,,but either way you're trying to cancel out all of the constants,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:42:47.100000,00:42:50.200000,,so we start at two k two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:42:50.200000,00:42:52.800000,,it's being multiplied by k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:42:53.200000,00:42:58,,and so you would do the opposite pause filler operation,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:42:58.600000,00:43:00.700000,so fourteen divided by two,,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:43:00.700000,00:43:00.800000,,huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:43:01.200000,00:43:02.200000,so fourteen divided by two,,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:43:02.500000,00:43:08.400000,,yes fourteen divided by two,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:43:08.400000,00:43:09,seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:43:09.400000,00:43:12,,seven okay,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:43:12.500000,00:43:12.900000,seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,1,00:43:14.500000,00:43:15.900000,,I think I'm writing all this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,1,00:43:15.900000,00:43:17,,but you're still doing the work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,1,00:43:17,00:43:18.900000,,so I don't want them to think I was doing all this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,1,00:43:18.900000,00:43:21.300000,,because you're telling me this what to write down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,1,00:43:21.300000,00:43:24.200000,no I'm just really bad at writing that's all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,1,00:43:24.200000,00:43:26.100000,,yeah I think down yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,1,00:43:26.100000,00:43:27.800000,so then (inaudible) I think I hope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,1,00:43:27.800000,00:43:34,,yeah I just don't want to watch this and (inaudible) and be like oh that girl didn't teach her anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,1,00:43:34,00:43:37.600000,,she just did all the work all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,1,00:43:37.900000,00:43:40.400000,,and so seven and what would the other side be,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:43:45.600000,00:43:46.400000,pause filler minus seven maybe,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:43:46.400000,00:43:48.800000,,oh wait why did I degrade at seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:43:48.800000,00:43:51.600000,,oh wait because it is seven sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:43:52.300000,00:43:56.100000,I just don't get how anything plus thirty-six can equal fourteen,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:43:56.600000,00:43:56.800000,,huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:43:57.100000,00:43:57.600000,unless it's negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:43:57.600000,00:43:59.600000,,yeah so the entire thing is like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:44:00.100000,00:44:02.300000,,that's what I want to think about logically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:44:02.300000,00:44:07.800000,,but sometimes like pause filler you can if you just follow like the rules,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:44:07.800000,00:44:10.600000,,and you understand the rules now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:44:10.600000,00:44:12,,but we all have different ways of thinking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:44:12,00:44:13.900000,,like some people are just like this is the rule,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,2,00:44:13.900000,00:44:14.600000,,and you follow this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:14.700000,00:44:18.300000,,and we're like well logically that doesn't make sense like that's like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:18.300000,00:44:21.600000,,I was like well logically like when I was writing negatives and stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:21.600000,00:44:23.100000,,I was like logically it would be this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:23.100000,00:44:25.700000,,and then they're like nope because this rules is this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:25.700000,00:44:26.800000,,so it actually will be this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:27.800000,00:44:30.900000,,yeah so there are stuff like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:30.900000,00:44:31.900000,,I just follow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:31.900000,00:44:33.500000,,I have the certain set of rules,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:33.500000,00:44:34.200000,,and I follow them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:34.200000,00:44:37.300000,,and that is what you do to one side you do to the other,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,4,00:44:38,00:44:44.100000,,so we divided fourteen by two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:44:44.100000,00:44:45.600000,,so I divide this by two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:44:46.200000,00:44:48.300000,,pause filler I messed something up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:44:48.300000,00:44:54.400000,what would be two divided by two,,,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:44:54.600000,00:44:54.700000,,huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:44:54.700000,00:44:57.800000,two divided by two would equal to zero so fourteen divided two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:44:57.800000,00:45:01.200000,,yeah two divided two so which means we're just left with,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:01.200000,00:45:03.800000,,yeah we're just left with seven equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:04.200000,00:45:05.100000,thirty-six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:05.100000,00:45:08.700000,,thirty-six but we still have plus k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:08.700000,00:45:10.200000,,because we just cancelled out the two,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:10.200000,00:45:11.500000,,we didn't cancel out the k,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:13.200000,00:45:18.300000,so we have to get one of this thirty-six or seven,,,0,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:19,00:45:21.800000,,no thirty-six because seven yeah,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:22.300000,00:45:28,so thirty-six minus thirty-six equals zero so seven minus thirty-six,,,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:28.600000,00:45:30.200000,,yup exactly,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:32.400000,00:45:35,well equal minus twenty-nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:35,00:45:35.100000,hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:35.800000,00:45:36.600000,negative twenty-nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,3,0.0,3,00:45:36.900000,00:45:38.300000,,yup so negative,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:46:30.100000,00:46:31.300000,we get rid of the p,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:46:32.400000,00:46:40.500000,,yeah by canceling it out adding b but what we do to one side we have to do it to the next,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:46:40.800000,00:46:42.900000,so b plus b equals b (laughter),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,5,00:46:43.800000,00:46:48.800000,,so let's just pause filler write it out again over here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,5,00:46:49.400000,00:47:03.800000,,so seven seventeen sorry equals eighteen plus two b,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,5,00:47:04,00:47:09.100000,would b we're getting rid off because this one the seventeen minus b,,,ODQ,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,5,00:47:09.200000,00:47:11.700000,that one could stay but the thirteen plus b,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,5,00:47:11.700000,00:47:14.400000,I think we should get rid of that one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,6,00:47:14.500000,00:47:15.600000,,well you could it either way,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,6,00:47:15.600000,00:47:17,,I think you could pause filler,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,6,00:47:17.700000,00:47:20.200000,,actually I don't think you could do it either way,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,6,00:47:20.500000,00:47:25.900000,,because we need to trans like I guess,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,6,00:47:26.100000,00:47:28.100000,I got it I got it on my mind,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,6,00:47:28.100000,00:47:31.800000,,it's really hard to explain if you want it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,6,00:47:31.900000,00:47:34.100000,,I don't think you could keep the minus b,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,6,00:47:34.100000,00:47:43.900000,,because if you want it to minus that one if you want to do to minus b minus b you just be locked with like negative b,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,2,00:47:43.900000,00:47:48.700000,,I don't really know I don't think it works so,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,2,00:47:48.700000,00:47:53.600000,I guess I have to go two time two or we never mind,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,2,00:47:53.800000,00:47:57.100000,we have to get rid of thirteen so,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,2,00:47:57.500000,00:47:59.300000,,yeah you can do whatever first,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,2,00:47:59.300000,00:48:01.600000,thirteen minus thirteen equals zero,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,2,00:48:02.100000,00:48:05.200000,seventeen minus thirteen equals four so,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,2,00:48:05.300000,00:48:06.600000,,so let's get I don't know why,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,2,00:48:06.700000,00:48:11.400000,,I like to scribble this out but just so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,2,00:48:11.400000,00:48:12.600000,,what did you say four,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,3,00:48:14.500000,00:48:19.200000,yeah four because three plus four equals thirteen,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,3,00:48:19.800000,00:48:23.500000,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,3,00:48:23.500000,00:48:26.500000,,minus thirteen equals four,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,3,00:48:26.500000,00:48:37.500000,,I'm just going to rewrite this because yeah okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,3,00:48:37.500000,00:48:39.500000,,so here's what we have left,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:48:39.500000,00:48:45.400000,well so we must be going four divide it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:48:45.400000,00:48:48.900000,because two times b equals four,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:48:48.900000,00:48:50.500000,so we go four divided by two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:48:50.500000,00:48:52.200000,it would be two,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:48:52.800000,00:48:54.100000,,yeah so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:48:54.500000,00:48:55.600000,so two equals b,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:48:55.600000,00:48:59.300000,,yup b equals two,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:48:59.300000,00:49:00.500000,,that's not a two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:49:00.500000,00:49:01.700000,that's an eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:49:02.600000,00:49:04.400000,,that's now it's kind of a two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:49:04.400000,00:49:05.400000,,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:49:05.400000,00:49:08.300000,,I draw away in twos you know what whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:49:08.300000,00:49:11.600000,,you can see it like above it that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:49:11.600000,00:49:12.400000,,it's four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,4,00:49:12.400000,00:49:13,it's on recording (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,4,1.0,5,00:49:13.200000,00:49:16.300000,,yeah we're saying it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,6,00:49:16.400000,00:50:17.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:16.400000,00:49:19.100000,minus nine it (inaudible) so,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:20,00:49:22.100000,,this thing is easier I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:22.100000,00:49:22.200000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:23.200000,00:49:24.200000,,yeah this is easier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:24.200000,00:49:26.100000,so one divided by nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:26.200000,00:49:30,,I think it's only one step mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:30,00:49:34.500000,,so divided by but you would divide it by negative nine right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:34.500000,00:49:35,yeah but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:35.200000,00:49:37.800000,,yeah negative nine pause filler,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:38,00:49:39.300000,well can you go negative nine that's all,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,5,00:49:39.300000,00:49:40.800000,that is just add minus nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,4,00:49:51.600000,00:49:58.700000,so nine times nine would equal eighty-one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,4,00:49:58.700000,00:50:05.300000,so nine divided by nine or eighty-one divided by nine would be nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,4,00:50:06.300000,00:50:06.500000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,4,00:50:07.900000,00:50:09.300000,or minus nine (laughter) in this case,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,4,00:50:09.500000,00:50:14.300000,,yeah right we would add the minus,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,5,1.0,6,00:50:14.500000,00:50:17.300000,,okay that was quick good job,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,3,00:50:18,00:51:17.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:18,00:50:18.300000,okay okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:18.300000,00:50:21.300000,,this one's longer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:21.700000,00:50:22.500000,man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:22.500000,00:50:24.200000,,okay so now we do no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:24.600000,00:50:28,,all right the variable is still on one side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:29.800000,00:50:29.900000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:30.700000,00:50:30.900000,,oh okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:31.800000,00:50:34.300000,so we get rid of the ten,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:34.900000,00:50:36.700000,so ten minus ten equals zero,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:36.700000,00:50:39.400000,eighty-two minus ten equals seventy-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:40.600000,00:50:52.900000,,okay so we have seventy-two equals negative eight y,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:54.400000,00:50:57.700000,so now we'd be getting rid of the negative eight,,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:58.100000,00:50:58.500000,,pause filler yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:50:59.200000,00:51:03.500000,so negative eight equal or negative eight plus eight equals zero,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,6,00:51:03.500000,00:51:06.900000,so seventy-two plus eight equals eighty,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,3,00:51:07.900000,00:51:16.700000,,all right so y equals eighty,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,6,0.0,3,00:51:18.300000,00:51:21.400000,,okay you're much better at this than me,,,,,,,,,MCRP,,LPA,,,,,,,

10,1,T2,6,0.0,3,00:51:39.600000,00:51:42.900000,so we'd have to get rid of the sixty-five first here,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,7,0.0,4,00:51:39.600000,00:54:02.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,7,0.0,6,00:51:43.600000,00:51:47.400000,,okay and that's being subtracted which means (inaudible),,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,7,0.0,6,00:51:47.400000,00:51:55,sixty-five minus sixty-five will equals zero,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,7,0.0,6,00:51:55,00:52:06.100000,than a hundred and seven minus sixty-five would equal pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,7,0.0,6,00:52:06.100000,00:52:07.900000,,wouldn't that be like thirty-five,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T2,7,0.0,2,00:52:20.200000,00:52:20.900000,,it's easy to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,7,0.0,2,00:52:20.900000,00:52:28.400000,sixty-two plus sixty-five that's not a five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,7,0.0,2,00:52:28.400000,00:52:35,I'm writing on sixty-two plus sixty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

10,1,T2,7,0.0,4,00:52:44.200000,00:52:47,,so a hundred minus sixty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,1,T2,7,0.0,4,00:52:47,00:53:02.900000,one over seven six five two bye-bye (inaudible) forty-two so forty-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,S1 ,,,2,00:05:38.500000,00:05:41.400000,,because I've been in case ever for like three years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,2,00:05:41.400000,00:05:46.800000,,I've had the full computer in those three years which is the same computer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,2,00:05:46.800000,00:05:50.300000,you've gone through a lot less computers than I have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,2,00:05:50.300000,00:05:52.900000,,yeah well like I think I've broken one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,2,00:05:52.900000,00:05:53.700000,,I broken it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,2,00:05:53.700000,00:05:58.900000,,and I sent it to get them fixed or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,2,00:05:58.900000,00:06:00.300000,,I've to use my sister's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:00.300000,00:06:03.500000,,but it's obviously like the same type of computer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:03.500000,00:06:06,,I know right now they have the bigger ones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:06,00:06:08.600000,,is yours like smaller than usual,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,QE,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:09.900000,00:06:11.800000,,or is it normal size,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,QE,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:12,00:06:12.600000,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:12.600000,00:06:17.900000,out of all the laptops I've had probably like the third biggest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:18.400000,00:06:20.600000,,yeah mine is like really small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:20.600000,00:06:27.300000,,it's probably even smaller than this cad thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:27.300000,00:06:29.200000,yeah you must have the same one as my sister then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:29.200000,00:06:31.900000,because my sister has like the older and half the size of this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:32,00:06:34.900000,,yeah I don't know why they make it so small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:34.900000,00:06:37.900000,,but it's probably because when I type on that computer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:37.900000,00:06:40.300000,,and then I type on a bigger computer and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:40.300000,00:06:41.300000,and like way (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:41.400000,00:06:43.500000,,I yeah and I always mistype,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:43.800000,00:06:47.700000,,because my hands are so used to typing on a smaller ones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:47.700000,00:06:50.400000,,when it's bigger it's like throws everything off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:50.500000,00:07:00.400000,,and so there's always typos sort of like change to do stuff on my sister's computer any computer that's normal sized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:07:00.400000,00:07:04.100000,yeah and I am pretty bad at typing anyway so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,4,00:07:04.100000,00:07:06.300000,,I used to be horrible at typing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:06.300000,00:07:10.700000,,and then I think just from doing cyber school I got better at it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:10.700000,00:07:12.500000,,I'm not going to say I'm fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:12.700000,00:07:15.800000,,but I can do it better than I could three years ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:17.700000,00:07:20.500000,yeah I'm pretty slow at it (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:20.500000,00:07:25.700000,,but it's better than my handwriting,,,,,,,,,,,,LPP,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:25.700000,00:07:27,,and everything is all perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,LPP,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:27,00:07:31.800000,,so I would prefer than to writing on paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:49.900000,00:07:50.200000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:52.700000,00:07:53.300000,,wait what (inaudible),,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:18.800000,00:08:22.900000,,we have twenty minutes all the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:22.900000,00:08:25.100000,,because we have two different times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:25.100000,00:08:28.200000,,we're trying to figure out which one is correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:29.500000,00:08:30,that's mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:30,00:08:31,,I got eight À_À_À_o seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:31.500000,00:08:33.600000,well what did I say eight À_À_À_o seven,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:35.600000,00:08:36.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:37.400000,00:08:38.800000,,very,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:41,00:08:42.300000,,just ask me for the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:42.300000,00:08:44.300000,,and I'll tell you what's the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,,,7,00:08:51.800000,00:23:33.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:51.800000,00:08:54.200000,,oh twenty minutes really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:54.300000,00:08:56.300000,I know right I know (inaudible),,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:08:56.700000,00:20:46.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:57.100000,00:09:04,,okay so this isn't anything new I don't think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:04.600000,00:09:05.100000,nope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:05.100000,00:09:06.600000,,I'm going to draw the line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:06.700000,00:09:09.400000,,because that helps me for some reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:09.500000,00:09:16.100000,,I'm guessing I'm supposed to subtract x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:16.100000,00:09:20.600000,,because that's what the papers were saying,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:20.600000,00:09:23.500000,,is that correct because no,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:23.500000,00:09:25.100000,,no I'm supposed to divide x,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:25.700000,00:09:27.100000,,I'm not sure one minute,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:27.100000,00:09:33,,let me think pause filler yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:36.800000,00:09:40.600000,,and just make this forty over x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:40.800000,00:09:41.800000,cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:42.400000,00:09:49.900000,,okay this might be right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:49.900000,00:10:01,,so then if I did that I have eight over seven equals forty oops,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:10:01,00:10:04.200000,,oops I clicked the find okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:10:04.300000,00:10:06.100000,not that button,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:10:06.100000,00:10:08.200000,,I wish it was red,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:10:08.200000,00:10:13,,and then it can say don't click the red button,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:10:14,00:10:19.400000,,okay does that make any sense I think,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:10:19.500000,00:10:20.500000,I think so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:10:20.800000,00:10:21.600000,,I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:10:21.600000,00:10:24.800000,pause filler maybe we're using cross products,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:10:24.800000,00:10:28.400000,where like it go seven times forty and three times x equals,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:10:28.400000,00:10:33,,oh you could do that or you could just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:10:34.100000,00:10:36.400000,,I think I did that wrong,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:10:36.400000,00:10:36.800000,,what do you think,,0,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:10:36.800000,00:10:38.300000,,because I think I did that wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:10:38.800000,00:10:41.200000,pause filler when I learned it it was set up this way,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:10:41.200000,00:10:42.400000,but we used cross products,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:10:42.400000,00:10:45.900000,so it would be forty times seven and forty times x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:10:46.300000,00:10:46.600000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:10:46.600000,00:10:51.200000,but it's not about how I learned it so no promises (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:10:51.200000,00:11:08.800000,,so forty times does that mean just got to cross that out,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:11:09.300000,00:11:19.900000,or maybe we're supposed to multiply both the sides by the thing worth writing so like three seven times three seven and forty time three seventh,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:11:19.900000,00:11:21.900000,,yeah that might make sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:11:21.900000,00:11:25.600000,,but like that's doing the same thing right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:11:25.600000,00:11:26.700000,yeah pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:11:26.700000,00:11:35,,okay I'm going to try this so forty times seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:35,00:11:51.700000,,how come I don't have that memorized,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:51.700000,00:11:52.400000,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:52.400000,00:11:54.300000,,let's do it in my head,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:54.300000,00:12:01.500000,,would that be two hundred and eighty,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:01.600000,00:12:02.300000,,that's what I got,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:02.300000,00:12:03.300000,yeah two eighty,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:03.300000,00:12:06.300000,,two eighty that way right that's the top or the bottom,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:06.300000,00:12:07.200000,,I think that's the top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:07.200000,00:12:09.400000,top because forty times seven,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:12:09.400000,00:12:12.400000,,yeah over a three x then,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:12:12.800000,00:12:13,yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:12:13,00:12:22.800000,,and then I'm confused,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,6,00:12:23.300000,00:12:41.800000,,because it's supposed to say like in the format of this equals like constant constant constant equals variable or something like that,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,6,00:12:42.600000,00:12:45.900000,,so now it's just fraction,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,6,00:12:45.900000,00:12:48.800000,,oh well I'll see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,6,00:12:48.800000,00:12:51.800000,,maybe I'll get the right answer and just be doing it the wrong way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,6,00:12:51.800000,00:12:59.300000,,so try to get rid of yeah see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,6,00:12:59.300000,00:13:02.700000,,now this is all messed up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,6,00:13:03,00:13:07.400000,I'm looking at it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:13:07.800000,00:13:11,I'm not quite sure,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:13:11.100000,00:13:12.400000,I never learned about this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:13:12.600000,00:13:17.700000,,yeah okay maybe I should try it a different way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:13:17.700000,00:13:20.300000,,and then if it doesn't work I'll come back to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:13:20.400000,00:13:25.100000,it sounds like a hundred equals the fraction with a number (inaudible),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:13:25.500000,00:13:27.900000,so it says to go like first,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:13:27.900000,00:13:30.200000,it would be forty times thirty-seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:13:30.200000,00:13:32,and then that's the answer,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:13:33.200000,00:13:36.800000,,forty times what,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:37,00:13:41,thirty-seven so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:41,00:13:42.700000,,okay how would you do that,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:42.700000,00:13:46.600000,I think we might have to set up a forty as a fraction,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:46.600000,00:13:51.300000,so maybe we could put it over one forty over one times,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:52.100000,00:13:54.100000,,yeah that makes sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:54.100000,00:13:54.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:54.400000,00:13:55.900000,,three that's a bad three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:55.900000,00:13:58,,but at least I know it's a three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:58,00:13:58.400000,yeah it's a three (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:58.400000,00:14:12.300000,,okay times forty over one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:14:12.300000,00:14:16.100000,so let me find the common denominator and all that,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:14:16.200000,00:14:18.200000,,or wait can I just do this no can I no,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:14:49.200000,00:14:55.400000,one twenty over one or one twenty and ten also I think we got it (laughter),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:14:55.400000,00:15:00.500000,,yeah so we have one twenty over seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:15:00.600000,00:15:09,,we do have to simplify that over one or wait divide it,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:15:09,00:15:16.500000,one twenty divided by seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:18:01.700000,00:18:03.600000,,it goes into seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:18:03.600000,00:18:06.700000,,oh wait seven goes and fifty pause filler seven times,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:18:06.700000,00:18:14.600000,because with the seven fourteen twenty-one twenty-eight thirty-two or no no nothing I can remember,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:18:14.900000,00:18:16.900000,no you're right (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:18:22,00:18:26,,I guess not fifty oh well forty-nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:18:26.300000,00:18:32.900000,we'll just go one twenty over seven (laughter),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:18:33,00:18:37.400000,,yeah can I scroll down for a while,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:18:37.400000,00:18:41,,I'll just do up to this side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:18:41.100000,00:18:41.200000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:18:41.200000,00:18:50.900000,,fifty minus nine is one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:18:50.900000,00:18:52.800000,,and what do you do,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:18:52.800000,00:18:56.300000,,can I just say r one,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:18:56.300000,00:18:57,then you get a one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:18:57,00:18:58.400000,and then you'd get another zero,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:18:58.400000,00:19:01.500000,so you get ten one time,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:19:01.500000,00:19:03.100000,,so ten okay,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:19:03.300000,00:19:04.800000,this is a repeating process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:19:04.800000,00:19:07.200000,,I really need to scroll down scrolling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:19:07.200000,00:19:08.900000,,there's a setting that says scrolling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:08.900000,00:19:11.600000,this will just be pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:11.700000,00:19:14.700000,but this will pretty much just be a repeating thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:14.700000,00:19:17.300000,,yeah right one repeating seventeen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:17.300000,00:19:20.600000,so seventeen what's seventeen seventeen seventeen,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:20.600000,00:19:20.600000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:20.600000,00:19:21.700000,so it will be a long decimal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:21.700000,00:19:22.900000,so just say seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:22.900000,00:19:25.100000,,fifteen point one repeated right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:25.200000,00:19:25.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:26.700000,00:19:30.300000,,one repeated so what was it,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:19:30.300000,00:19:47.200000,,the variable x equals pause filler seventeen point one p,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:19:47.200000,00:19:50.800000,,encircle it so people know that's the very answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:19:50.800000,00:19:55,,because everything else is a mess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:19:55,00:19:55.100000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:19:55.100000,00:19:55.900000,,that's it forever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:19:55.900000,00:19:56.800000,,I'm sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:19:56.800000,00:19:58.600000,next to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:19:58.700000,00:20:02.200000,,finally again this is like same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:20:02.200000,00:20:04.300000,,this wasn't on the paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:20:04.300000,00:20:05.600000,,this was on the paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:20:05.600000,00:20:06.700000,,I think it was on paper now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:20:06.700000,00:20:08.700000,,it just didn't get far enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:08.700000,00:20:13.800000,,okay yeah except I don't have a paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:13.900000,00:20:16.300000,,okay so what does it say to do,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:16.400000,00:20:22.700000,it says this one is a hundred equals two over three y,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:23.100000,00:20:27.700000,so it says multiply both sides by three over two,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:27.700000,00:20:30.200000,and then it gets a hundred and fifty,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:30.200000,00:20:33.900000,,so multiply oh yeah that makes sense now okay,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:34,00:20:36.100000,,because you're trying to get k,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:36.100000,00:20:39.500000,,so we'll multiply why side by three over eight,,,,,,EC,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:20:39.500000,00:20:46,because three over eight times three over eight we'll cross cancel that out so fourteen time three over eight,,,,,,ER,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:20:46.300000,00:20:54.800000,,so here I just got k and then oh three over eight and the answer,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,7,00:20:46.300000,00:23:33.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:20:54.800000,00:21:07.200000,,this has been a b equal to k times fourteen over one equals,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:07.300000,00:21:09.900000,maybe I guess a lowest common denominator thing,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:09.900000,00:21:16,,maybe or you just got to like divide or something,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:16,00:21:18.200000,because one could go into eight pretty easily,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:18.200000,00:21:20.700000,so eight would be the lowest common denominator,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:20.700000,00:21:26.900000,so it would be three over eight times fourteen over eight (inaudible),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:26.900000,00:21:33.400000,,okay three times fourteen twenty-eight thirty-two oh,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:33.400000,00:21:33.600000,yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:33.700000,00:21:36.600000,I think so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:36.600000,00:21:40.800000,so let me let me just check it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:40.800000,00:21:44.200000,,okay I don't know why there's weird dots,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:44.400000,00:21:48.400000,,yeah I don't know why but okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:48.400000,00:21:48.900000,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:48.900000,00:21:52.900000,,okay I'm going to start y up here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:53,00:21:54.500000,in forty-two,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:54.700000,00:21:55.400000,,forty or thirty,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:21:55.900000,00:22:00.400000,forty-two because it will be four plus four plus four equals twelve,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:00.400000,00:22:01.800000,so you carry a one,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:01.800000,00:22:06.400000,,what's forty-two over eight,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:06.400000,00:22:06.600000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:06.600000,00:22:06.900000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:06.900000,00:22:09.400000,so then eight would go into forty-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:09.400000,00:22:11.200000,,okay wait now that's I set this up wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:11.200000,00:22:12.700000,,eight goes into forty-two what did you,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:12.700000,00:22:13.200000,you go first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:13.200000,00:22:28.600000,,oh I was going to ask if you bother anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:28.600000,00:22:31.700000,,because I'm still working on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:31.700000,00:22:33.600000,so eight and eight equals sixteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:33.600000,00:22:38.600000,sixteen plus eight equals twenty-four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:38.600000,00:22:41.300000,twenty-four plus eight equals thirty-two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:41.300000,00:22:44,so then thirty-two plus eight equals forty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:44,00:22:46.700000,so you can get the forty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:46.700000,00:22:46.900000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T1 ,2,0.0,5,00:22:46.900000,00:22:48.600000,so then it would be five times,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:42:15.500000,00:42:22.800000,,yeah okay to get rid of the four two times four,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:42:22.800000,00:42:27.900000,or no because it's not a minus four,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:42:27.900000,00:42:31,it's a four times four will be six,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:42:31,00:42:33.200000,and twelve four times four wouldn't be zero,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:42:33.200000,00:42:33.400000,,right right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:42:39.100000,00:42:41.100000,,divide it pause filler maybe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:42:42,00:42:46,,wait four is being divided by k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:42:46,00:42:49.200000,nah what did I write,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:42:52.600000,00:42:54.500000,go away seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:42:54.500000,00:42:55.400000,,and maybe you're right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:42:55.400000,00:43:01.400000,undo undo oh (laughter) the face is like an eight so four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:43:01.400000,00:43:03.400000,it's like a four equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:43:03.400000,00:43:07.300000,we'll just say zero if not equals one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:43:07.300000,00:43:08.100000,,you know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:43:15,00:43:20.900000,,it doesn't really matter like what you get on this side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:43:21.100000,00:43:22.900000,,like does it really matter what you get on more side,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:43:22.900000,00:43:27.200000,,it just like matters what admiration yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:43:33.400000,00:43:39,,and you were trying to divide it the same time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:43:39,00:43:40.300000,,I was trying to erase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:43:40.300000,00:43:44.300000,kind of planning this stuff (laughter) so then stop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:43:50,00:43:55,no when you press two card for too long it immediately pops up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:43:55,00:43:55.600000,,oh okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:43:56,00:43:58.500000,so one minus that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:43:58.500000,00:44:00.600000,,wait one second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:44:00.600000,00:44:03.900000,,I'm going to sign something might tell this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:44:05.700000,00:44:08.500000,so four oh (inaudible) scratch paper (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:44:08.500000,00:44:12.600000,,see okay well I have (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:44:12.800000,00:44:19.500000,,and it's two over x equals twenty,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:44:19.600000,00:44:24.800000,,it says which is what we have right now,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:44:24.800000,00:44:28.200000,,and this is multiply both sides by x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:44:29.700000,00:44:30.400000,oh no no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:44:31.900000,00:44:34.200000,,so if you multiply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:44:34.200000,00:44:36.800000,,wait this is what we're supposed to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:44:36.800000,00:44:39.400000,,so as you multiply both sides by x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:39.500000,00:44:40,got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:40.800000,00:44:41.900000,,you got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:42.400000,00:44:42.700000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:42.700000,00:44:42.800000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:42.800000,00:44:45,because it would be twenty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:45,00:44:46.100000,,because this thing is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:46.100000,00:44:49.400000,,I don't know if you're supposed to do that,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:49.400000,00:44:51.700000,,because it's the same set of,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:51.700000,00:44:54.200000,,its two over x equals twenty,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:54.200000,00:44:58,,and then it says multiply both sides by x (inaudible),,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:44:58,00:45:05.200000,but we have the fifty-four to before the k plus fifty-four,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:45:05.400000,00:45:11.300000,,yeah but that's the equation like we have right now like in the green,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:45:12.400000,00:45:14.700000,,so I don't know if that would tell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:45:15.500000,00:45:19.100000,,but technically we would follow the same steps and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:45:19.100000,00:45:20.200000,oh that's okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:45:22.400000,00:45:27.800000,,okay so divided by x so then if we would divide it by k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:45:27.800000,00:45:31.800000,,you would just be left with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:45:34,00:45:40.100000,,if we do it this way we would be left with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:45:40.100000,00:45:41,,was that four,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:45:41,00:45:44.900000,there would be no remainder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:45:44.900000,00:45:47.100000,there will be no remainder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:45:45,00:45:45.200000,,hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:45:47.400000,00:45:56.300000,,for that one okay I'm just going to real quick do it this way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:45:56.300000,00:46:03.900000,,and see if you get the same answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:46:03.900000,00:46:10.700000,well you see what I did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:46:10.700000,00:46:13.100000,so (laughter) yeah let's break (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:46:13.100000,00:46:20,,(inaudible) equals sixty-two k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:46:24.900000,00:46:25.600000,nice snails,,,,,,,,,,,,,LPP,,,,SV,,

10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:46:30.900000,00:46:31.500000,yeah that's me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:46:32.200000,00:46:56.100000,,I know so divide both sides by twenty twenty sixty-two wait still worst sixty-two ever,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:46:56.100000,00:47:01.400000,,it says divide both sides by the number,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:47:02.600000,00:47:07,,and then we just (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:47:07.100000,00:47:08.500000,,that makes no sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:47:09.200000,00:47:10.600000,,oh I guess that does,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:47:10.600000,00:47:22.600000,,then I get four over sixty-two equals k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:47:22.600000,00:47:30.500000,,and then you simplify the four over sixty-two by dividing it,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:47:30.500000,00:47:32.600000,,which is what we did here,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:47:32.600000,00:47:34.800000,,and you get one five five,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:47:35.200000,00:47:37.400000,,so like we got the same answers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:47:37.400000,00:47:38.900000,,so this would be the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:47:39.600000,00:47:42.100000,,but we did it different ways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:47:42.600000,00:47:42.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:47:43.100000,00:47:47.900000,,okay but I don't think it really matters at this point because,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:47:48.300000,00:47:51,(inaudible) (laughter) you made it a lot further last time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:01:41.400000,00:01:43.800000,yeah looks like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:01:43.800000,00:01:46.100000,,pause filler yeah it's nice how they have a shared whiteboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:01:46.100000,00:01:46.800000,,that's cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:01:47.600000,00:01:49.600000,,that's something that I've never seen them before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,

11,1,S1 ,,,0,00:02:08.100000,00:02:11.400000,well next year I'm pretty sure you'll be learning biology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS
11,1,S1 ,,,0,00:02:11.500000,00:02:13.400000,and on the second semester,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,0,00:02:13.400000,00:02:15.200000,,oh I'm learning biology this year too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,0,00:02:15.200000,00:02:20.200000,yeah well one of the schools I guess you need to learn it twice it's pretty interesting but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS
11,1,S1 ,,,0,00:02:20.400000,00:02:20.700000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:02:25.800000,00:02:33.200000,,pause filler yeah I hear it's going to be almost exactly the same as it was pause filler in middle school,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:02:33.200000,00:02:34.700000,,which middle school did you go to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,QE,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:02:35,00:02:37.200000,I pause filler did a program called Cyber School,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:02:37.500000,00:02:41.300000,and pause filler it was just a tutoring school remotely from home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:02:41.300000,00:02:44.100000,and pause filler using like computers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:02:44.100000,00:02:45.900000,and going to like online classes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:02:45.900000,00:02:48.200000,and learning so that yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:02:48.800000,00:02:49.700000,,okay cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:02:49.700000,00:02:52.500000,,would you say you know a lot about the algebra we're learning here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,IDQ,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:02:52.500000,00:02:56.300000,pause filler I mean I don't really get them out so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,IDQ
11,1,S1 ,,,5,00:02:56.900000,00:03:07.300000,,yeah yeah yeah I suppose this probably works a little better with kids who are less knowledgeable about it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS,
11,1,S1 ,,,5,00:03:07.700000,00:03:08,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,5,00:03:08,00:03:12.900000,but when it comes to advanced stuff I'm a little rusty on that but yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,5,00:03:12.900000,00:03:16.600000,,yeah I haven't really done algebra in a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,IDQ,
11,1,S1 ,,,5,00:03:16.900000,00:03:19.900000,,we're learning geometry this time of year pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,5,00:03:21.800000,00:03:22.700000,nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:03:24.700000,00:03:27.100000,,yeah last year was our algebra thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:03:27.100000,00:03:30,,have you taken keystones yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,QE,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:03:30.100000,00:03:36.500000,pause filler last week pause filler one same Thursday I did the biology keystones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:03:36.600000,00:03:38.400000,and that's was it so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:03:38.800000,00:03:45.500000,,okay yeah our school as part of our math program we do the keystones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:03:45.500000,00:03:48.800000,,pause filler just before high school,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:03:48.800000,00:03:51.400000,,so we don't have to deal with it then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:03:51.400000,00:03:52.900000,,just have to go through now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:03:57.500000,00:04:03.100000,,factoring polynomials is really the only thing that I've lost after that time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:04:03.200000,00:04:06.300000,,and overall it doesn't make a lot of sense to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:04:07.400000,00:04:11.400000,,but it doesn't seem like you would use it that much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:04:12.300000,00:04:17.400000,,as opposed to geometry and algebra where a lot more common,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:04:17.400000,00:04:22.300000,,but factoring polynomials that's all like the stuff that doesn't really tangible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,S1 ,,,4,00:04:23.100000,00:04:25.800000,mm-hmm yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,1,S1 ,,,3,00:04:55.100000,00:04:58.600000,,I see pause filler half of it is pause filler you and me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,3,00:04:58.600000,00:05:01.800000,,and then the other half would be the desktop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,3,00:05:02.200000,00:05:03.700000,yup that's what I'm seeing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,3,00:05:04.200000,00:05:05,it's blue pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,3,00:05:05,00:05:08.600000,,see anything interesting on the desktop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,S1 ,,,3,00:05:09.100000,00:05:10.300000,pause filler not really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:08.800000,00:11:13.100000,,oh so yup forty-four times x equals negative two twenty which means that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:13.100000,00:11:15.500000,so the opposite of it so then you would pause filler,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:16.500000,00:11:18.100000,,wait is that negative two twenty,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:18.100000,00:11:19.500000,,or what's going on right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:19.500000,00:11:23,pause filler I just see forty-four x equals twenty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:23,00:11:24.200000,yeah I don't see negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:24.200000,00:11:26.400000,,the top line is kind of like weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,

11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:38.500000,00:11:41.500000,,which pause filler divided by two zero,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:41.500000,00:11:47.300000,,let's just say divided by yeah divided by two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:47.300000,00:11:53.800000,,okay pause filler which means that one no one one zero,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:11:55.200000,00:11:58,all right well we can do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:11:58,00:11:59.300000,,divided by twenty-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:11:59.300000,00:12:00.400000,if that way works for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:00.400000,00:12:01.400000,we can do it that way but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:01.600000,00:12:03.400000,,yeah which way do you usually do it yeah,,ODQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:04.200000,00:12:06.900000,to tell you the truth I'll probably just use the calculator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:06.900000,00:12:09.200000,but since I don't have that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:09.200000,00:12:13.300000,pause filler we could set up where pause filler (inaudible) twenty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:14.600000,00:12:18.100000,then to go like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:18.500000,00:12:20.200000,,I mean we could factor it yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:21.300000,00:12:23,yeah this is the longest way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:23,00:12:25,but if we could do that way or wherever way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDE
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:25,00:12:25.600000,,that's (inaudible) yeah pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:25.700000,00:12:28.300000,but if you want to factor it go ahead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:29.100000,00:12:31,,let's see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:31,00:12:33.500000,,I feel like this would be a little easier on paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,IDS,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:33.700000,00:12:38.500000,,okay one one zero to be like fifty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:38.500000,00:12:41,,and then that would be five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:41,00:12:42,,would that be fifty-five,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:42.100000,00:12:43,,oh I think so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:43.200000,00:12:45.800000,,yeah fifty-five over eleven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:45.800000,00:12:49.800000,and then we can check,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:49.800000,00:12:54.500000,,oh wait doesn't that just mean that it's five over five wait five,,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:54.500000,00:12:56,I'm actually not sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,IDQ/IDS
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:56.300000,00:12:57.300000,,I'm not sure either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,IDS,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:57.300000,00:13:00.200000,,let's just say x equals five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:13:00.500000,00:13:02,,bam simplify everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:13:02.700000,00:13:04.600000,,let's just assume that's right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:13:05.500000,00:13:10.900000,,and if all else fails x equals two twenty over forty-four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:13:13.800000,00:13:14.300000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:13:14.300000,00:13:15.500000,,bam close enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:13:15.500000,00:13:18,all right so I assume,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:18.300000,00:14:08.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,3,00:13:18.700000,00:13:22.100000,,negative nine plus thirteen p equals forty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:22.600000,00:13:28.700000,so first step is to add the constant I think it's called,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:29.500000,00:13:33.500000,,yeah I guess because the quotient is this thing that you multiply by five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:33.700000,00:13:35.100000,yeah yeah the constant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:35.400000,00:13:36.200000,,so yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:36.500000,00:13:37.300000,so both that yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:37.300000,00:13:38.800000,so add nine,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:40.500000,00:13:46.200000,,so then fifty equals thirteen p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:46.800000,00:13:57.900000,,which means that p equals fifteen over thirty oh no fifty over thirteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:57.900000,00:13:58.300000,,correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:13:59.600000,00:14:03.400000,,which means that pause filler and you can't simplify that because p is prime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:14:03.400000,00:14:04.600000,,bam next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:14:05.100000,00:14:07,,or because thirteen is prime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:14:07.100000,00:14:07.600000,perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,

11,1,T1 ,6,1.0,5,00:14:14.400000,00:14:15.100000,pause filler so first step,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,6,1.0,5,00:14:16,00:14:16.900000,subtract ten,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,6,1.0,5,00:14:17,00:14:17.900000,,yeah subtract ten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,6,1.0,5,00:14:17.900000,00:14:18.800000,,so six x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,6,1.0,5,00:14:18.800000,00:14:20.900000,just like the last one except,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,6,1.0,5,00:14:20.900000,00:14:23.300000,,equals twenty-four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,6,1.0,5,00:14:24.700000,00:14:26.500000,yup and then divide,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,6,1.0,4,00:14:26.500000,00:14:30.100000,,which means divide it by four so six,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,6,1.0,4,00:14:31.100000,00:14:33.800000,,yeah pause filler so twenty-four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,6,1.0,4,00:14:33.800000,00:14:35,,I know that's easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:14:53.100000,00:14:53.800000,,yeah I think (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:14:54.100000,00:14:54.300000,pause filler wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:14:54.300000,00:14:55.200000,,there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:14:55.200000,00:14:56.300000,seven number seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,5,00:14:56.800000,00:14:57.400000,,seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,5,00:14:57.400000,00:14:58.800000,,there we go pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,5,00:14:59.400000,00:15:02.400000,forty equals negative twenty-two plus fifteen k,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,5,00:15:02.400000,00:15:05.900000,,plus well first step would be to add the thing so pause filler yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,5,00:15:06.100000,00:15:09.600000,yeah twenty-two to both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,5,00:15:09.600000,00:15:15.600000,,sixty-two equals fifteen k yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,5,00:15:15.800000,00:15:17,sixty yup,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,5,00:15:17,00:15:21.200000,and then you're going to want to divide fifteen k to both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:21.200000,00:15:28.600000,,so then sixty-two divided by fifteen equals k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:28.600000,00:15:29.400000,,yay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:30.300000,00:15:32.100000,,pause filler can we simplify that,,ODQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:32.100000,00:15:33,,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:33,00:15:36.400000,,okay I don't think so because it would have to be a five right,,ODQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:36.900000,00:15:37.200000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:38.500000,00:15:42,,pause filler oh we won't be able to divide it by three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:42,00:15:42.700000,,but I don't care anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:42.800000,00:15:47,,so okay so well first is that an equals,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:47,00:15:48.100000,that's not a minus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:48.100000,00:15:49,,okay that's an equals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:49.100000,00:15:49.900000,,there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:15:49.900000,00:15:50.600000,,that's an equals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:15:51.500000,00:16:37.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:15:51.800000,00:15:55.400000,,pause filler thirty-three minus twelve plus seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:15:57.300000,00:16:02.400000,,so then first we'd have to pause filler minus the twelve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:03.200000,00:16:03.900000,yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:03.900000,00:16:08.300000,,so pause filler thirty-three minus twelve equals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:09.400000,00:16:11.600000,,pause filler twenty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:11.600000,00:16:15.300000,,so twenty-one equals seven x yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:15.400000,00:16:17,and then what again to do off of that,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:17.400000,00:16:18.700000,,seven x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:18.700000,00:16:21.300000,,and after that I'll just that's seventy-eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:21.500000,00:16:23.800000,,I'm touching random buttons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:23.900000,00:16:28.600000,,pause filler which means that pause filler x equals three because yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:28.600000,00:16:31.500000,because yeah seven divided by twenty-one equals three,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:33.100000,00:16:34.700000,and we cannot simplify that anymore,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:35.100000,00:16:37.300000,,yup because three is just three three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,8,1.0,4,00:16:37.600000,00:16:40.500000,so this one there's pause filler we're going to do it step by step,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:37.600000,00:17:20.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:40.900000,00:16:43.200000,and we can do it like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:43.800000,00:16:46.500000,,let's just subtract p first so that begins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:46.500000,00:16:47.300000,subtract p first,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:47.500000,00:16:48.400000,that's a good,,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:48.600000,00:16:51.900000,,fifteen equals two p yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:51.900000,00:16:55.100000,all right and then plus twelve,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:55.700000,00:16:57.400000,and then let's add,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:57.600000,00:16:58.400000,,subtract twelve right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:58.400000,00:16:58.800000,,that would make,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:58.800000,00:16:59.600000,subtract twelve,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:16:59.600000,00:17:01.200000,yup that would be the next step all right,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:17:01.200000,00:17:03.400000,,yup pause filler so then subtract twelve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:17:03.400000,00:17:08.100000,,it would just be three equals two p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:17:08.100000,00:17:15.400000,,and that means that p equals three over two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:17:15.400000,00:17:17.900000,,and we can't simplify that because both of them are prime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:17:18.500000,00:17:19,perfect,,,,,,,,CF,,,,UL,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:17:19.200000,00:17:19.700000,that's great,,,,,,,,CF,,,,UL,,,,,,,

11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:17:23.300000,00:19:20.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:17:23.400000,00:17:24.700000,oops number ten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:17:25.300000,00:17:26.400000,yup last problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,5,00:17:26.400000,00:17:27,number ten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,5,00:17:27.300000,00:17:31.700000,so again we can do it we can pause filler start we can do lots of things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,5,00:17:31.700000,00:17:34,but let's just start off simpl with the k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,5,00:17:34.500000,00:17:35.800000,and get that out of the way first,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,5,00:17:36.400000,00:17:38,,okay so that would mean we subtract the k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,5,00:17:38,00:17:48,,so that means that negative ten equals seven k minus sixty-eight okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,5,00:17:48.100000,00:17:48.800000,yup,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,

11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,5,00:17:51.400000,00:17:52.500000,,that's it pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:17:53.400000,00:17:58.600000,,and that means that we can add sixty-eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:17:58.600000,00:17:59.800000,,so that means that pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:17:59.800000,00:18:00.300000,,oh crap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:18:00.300000,00:18:02.900000,,what's negative ten plus sixty-eight,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:18:02.900000,00:18:06.300000,,it's fifty-eight okay fifty-eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:18:06.300000,00:18:06.700000,,god damn it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,

11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:18:08.700000,00:18:14,,so I keep pressing buttons that are weird because these things have button on the weird side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:18:14.600000,00:18:18.900000,,pause filler fifty-eight equals seven k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:18:18.900000,00:18:21.400000,,and fifty-eight is divisible by seven right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:18:21.400000,00:18:23.100000,,now it's fifty-six right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:18:23.100000,00:18:24.400000,wait what did you just do pause filler with eight,,AE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:24.400000,00:18:27,,pause filler I added sixty-eight to both sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:27,00:18:28.400000,okay yup and yeah sixty-eight,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:28.400000,00:18:30,so then you get fifty-eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:30,00:18:32.200000,and then so then try to divide by seven and,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:32.300000,00:18:36.500000,,don't you even divide that by like I feel that's like no that's six,,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:36.500000,00:18:37.900000,,I think I'm thinking of six points,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:37.900000,00:18:38.600000,,no that's eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:39.100000,00:18:40.600000,,pause filler well I know that seven is prime anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:40.600000,00:18:41.400000,,so it doesn't matter all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:41.400000,00:18:42.800000,so wait I mean let's just like count up by seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:42.800000,00:18:44,so three times seven twenty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

11,2,S1 ,,,2,00:03:39.800000,00:03:40.500000,it was insane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,2,00:03:40.600000,00:03:44.800000,,it could be just on like every day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,2,00:03:44.800000,00:03:48.300000,yeah well it was a little bit of a challenge to get right there every day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,2,00:03:49.300000,00:03:55.500000,and sometimes it's pause filler yes it was fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,2,00:03:56.500000,00:03:58.100000,,did you know it would be,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,2,00:03:59.100000,00:04:00.800000,it wasn't even that much money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:00.900000,00:04:03.800000,I think it was like sixty dollars or fifty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:03.800000,00:04:06,I think it was sixty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:06,00:04:07,,all Season Pass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:07,00:04:09.800000,but they're doing it anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,6,00:04:09.800000,00:04:12.300000,and I could only use the pass on weekdays though so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,6,00:04:12.300000,00:04:18.300000,,oh on weekends because weekends (inaudible) very,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,6,00:04:18.300000,00:04:22.800000,on the weekdays the lines were relatively short,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,6,00:04:22.800000,00:04:23.600000,so it was awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,6,00:04:24.200000,00:04:33,,well the lines were just overall really short meaning it was going to be on Memorial Day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,6,00:04:33,00:04:34.400000,that makes sense yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,0,00:04:38.200000,00:04:41.600000,,yeah yup yup yup they had loud noise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,0,00:04:52.900000,00:05:00.900000,,wait is this mouse no it's not where wait,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,0,00:05:01.300000,00:05:03.700000,,is this shift control L and pan,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,0,00:05:03.900000,00:05:05,,what does pan mean,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:05.300000,00:05:16.600000,,does shift control (inaudible) wait a minute I found you touching these ones,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:16.800000,00:05:20.800000,,the last time I got curious I ruined everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:21,00:05:34.300000,,so there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,3,00:07:08.500000,00:07:10.300000,sweet are we going to start,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,3,00:07:10.700000,00:07:11.700000,,yup I guess they are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,3,00:07:11.800000,00:07:15.800000,all righty let's get this started,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,3,00:07:15.900000,00:07:18.900000,,so we are okay all right click,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,3,00:07:19.300000,00:07:24.200000,,all right we got three o seven times x equals forty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,3,00:07:24.500000,00:07:27.700000,,well I guess first thing we would do is pause filler multiply it by seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,3,00:07:28,00:07:35.500000,,you get three x equals pause filler forty divided or times seven well,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,3,00:07:35.500000,00:07:39.400000,,forty time seven pause filler seven times zero is,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,0,00:07:39.400000,00:07:40.300000,that's a long way to do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S1 ,,,0,00:07:40.400000,00:07:41.500000,that would be a longer way,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,,,5,00:07:41,00:28:03.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:07:41.500000,00:09:23.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:07:42.200000,00:07:45.500000,,is pause filler what is four times seven,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:07:45.500000,00:07:50.100000,,it's forty-eight right two hundred eighty there magic,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:07:50.100000,00:07:52.200000,,and then we just divide this by three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:07:52.500000,00:07:54.300000,and then you get your answer,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:07:54.600000,00:07:57.700000,,and that means x equals pause filler well pause filler,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:07:57.800000,00:08:01.400000,well but we could do it differently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:02.500000,00:08:04.500000,,yeah we could do this like this,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:04.500000,00:08:09.400000,,yeah let's just do it like pause filler thirty-eight and,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:09.400000,00:08:10,one division,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:10.300000,00:08:19,,so zero goes into that zero or twenty-eight pause filler like seven eight or eight time three twenty-four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:20,00:08:23.700000,,what's nine times three twenty-seven twenty-seven,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:23.700000,00:08:25.400000,,that would be it nine,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:25.400000,00:08:27.300000,,and we get twenty-seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:27.400000,00:08:28.500000,,so we get ten,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:29.700000,00:08:33.700000,,so we get pause filler plus three right yeah three,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:33.900000,00:08:38.300000,,and then that would be one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:38.300000,00:08:42,,so it would be nine three by three three three three three equals,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:42.700000,00:08:44.300000,that's what x would equal,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:44.300000,00:08:44.900000,I'm pretty sure,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:44.900000,00:08:48.900000,,I can do three point three three three now,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:48.900000,00:08:50.900000,,let's just say we're up ten all right yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:08:52.600000,00:09:00.700000,good all right for the next one let's just divide both sides by the pause filler the opposite of this,,,,,,,,SP,,,,UL,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:00.700000,00:09:02.200000,so like let's just like,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:02.900000,00:09:03.900000,I mean multiply each side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,Na,00:09:03.900000,00:09:08.300000,so like we'll do fourteen times,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:09:08.300000,00:09:11.600000,I want to make a dot dot make a dot,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,SV,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:09:12.300000,00:09:15.200000,there we go times like eight over three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:09:16.200000,00:09:18.200000,,eight over three that's the reciprocal,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:09:18.700000,00:09:22.600000,yeah so that's why you just do the reciprocal of the problem and then,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:09:22.600000,00:09:27.100000,,well fourteen time eight over three I don't understand how that would work exactly,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:09:23.500000,00:11:30.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,0,00:09:27.600000,00:09:29.800000,well I mean here let's just do this right,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,0,00:09:29.800000,00:09:30.800000,and then we'll just plug,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,0,00:09:30.800000,00:09:32.100000,,oh yeah you mean multiplying,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,0,00:09:32.200000,00:09:33.800000,yeah you multiply not divide,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,0,00:09:33.800000,00:09:34.700000,,yeah okay well you're,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,0,00:09:34.700000,00:09:36.100000,it was a dot it wasn't working though,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,SV,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,0,00:09:36.100000,00:09:38.200000,,yeah I see you're multiplying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,2,00:09:38.300000,00:09:44.500000,,this is to represent the division okay yeah pause filler well this just getting cross multiplied yet,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,2,00:09:44.800000,00:09:49.600000,,so we'll just have to do fourteen time eight fourteen times eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,2,00:09:49.600000,00:09:54.600000,,so eight times four is twenty-four right takes out yeah no no no,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,2,00:09:54.600000,00:09:59.900000,,eight time four is thirty-two and then pause filler two okay three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,2,00:09:59.900000,00:10:01.500000,,so it would be one one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,2,00:10:02.500000,00:10:03.700000,so one hundred and one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,2,00:10:03.700000,00:10:05.400000,,a hundred and twelve,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,2,00:10:05.800000,00:10:08.700000,yeah a hundred and twelve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,3,00:10:08.700000,00:10:15.100000,,a hundred twelve over three pause filler equals k and pause filler,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,3,00:10:16,00:10:18.200000,,well we'd simplify that or,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,3,00:10:18.300000,00:10:18.800000,can we,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,3,00:10:19.300000,00:10:23.400000,,I mean I'm sure we can we just have to get it to prime that right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,3,00:10:23.400000,00:10:24.200000,that should be the exact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,3,00:10:24.200000,00:10:26.700000,,I'm sure we're good yeah and back that to simplify,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,3,00:10:26.700000,00:10:28,,and we can get it so yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,3,00:10:28.500000,00:10:32.900000,yeah wait this three can go into twelve so we four by hundred,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,3,00:10:34.300000,00:10:35,,well no no,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:10:35,00:10:41,,let's see if both can be prime factorized pause filler so twelve,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:10:41,00:10:44.500000,,I mean one one two divided by,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:10:44.700000,00:10:45.700000,three goes into twelve,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:10:46.500000,00:10:47.800000,three does not go into a hundred,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:10:49.800000,00:10:52.600000,,so let's just say that's a (inaudible),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:10:52.600000,00:10:56.800000,,I can get it all right oh plus thirteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:10:56.800000,00:10:57.900000,,I think I can see it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:10:58.200000,00:11:01.200000,remember plus thirteen so what can you do about that,,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:01.200000,00:11:02.900000,,yeah subtract the thirteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:03,00:11:07.100000,,and then what's forty-four minus thirteen would be pause filler,,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:07.100000,00:11:12.200000,,let's just say one thirty-one okay whatever so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:12.200000,00:11:14.900000,and then let's just multiply the reciprocal of one half,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:15.100000,00:11:19.200000,,okay pause filler x equals thirty-one okay,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:19.200000,00:11:20,,so it means,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:20,00:11:22.200000,the reciprocal of that,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:22.300000,00:11:22.300000,,two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:22.300000,00:11:24.400000,so and let's just move yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:24.500000,00:11:29.500000,,thirteen over one time thirty-one over one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,2,0.0,4,00:11:31.200000,00:11:34.300000,you just do two times thirty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:11:31.800000,00:12:36.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:43.800000,00:11:45.300000,yeah x is being divided,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:45.300000,00:11:47.800000,,so you will multiply it yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:47.800000,00:11:51.800000,,pause filler yeah so two times thirty-one is sixty-two sixty-two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:51.800000,00:11:55.400000,,you have x equals sixty-two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:55.500000,00:11:59.700000,,I mean I'm not sure pause filler no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:59.800000,00:12:00.800000,,just look forward,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:01,00:12:03.900000,,thirty-one equals negative sixteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:04,00:12:05.900000,,oh I don't have to add sixteen here,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:06.700000,00:12:11.600000,,so pause filler thirty-one plus sixteen is forty-seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:11.600000,00:12:14.600000,,forty-seven equals three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:14.600000,00:12:17.700000,and then just do the reciprocal of that,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:17.800000,00:12:20.400000,,which is equals to half x is one over two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:20.400000,00:12:25.700000,,so I mean it's forty yeah seven times two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:25.900000,00:12:27,,it's time two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:27,00:12:28.400000,no just do forty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:28.700000,00:12:33.400000,this would be easier forty-seven times six over three the reciprocal,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:33.400000,00:12:34.400000,and just do that problem,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:34.400000,00:12:35.900000,,pause filler because the reciprocal of that I mean yeah,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:35.900000,00:12:36.800000,,that's what we're doing,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:36.800000,00:12:38.100000,,but it's just times two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:12:38.100000,00:12:39.800000,,because six over three is two,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,4,0.0,6,00:12:40.500000,00:12:41.600000,wait why would it be two,,AE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,5,0.0,5,00:12:41.600000,00:14:08.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,5,0.0,6,00:12:41.900000,00:12:43.700000,,because six divided by three equals two,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,5,0.0,6,00:12:44.400000,00:12:46.900000,okay wait yeah yeah yeah yeah that works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,5,0.0,6,00:12:46.900000,00:12:47.100000,that works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,5,0.0,6,00:12:47.100000,00:12:51.300000,,yeah so forty-seven two equals pause filler ninety-four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,5,0.0,6,00:12:51.300000,00:12:57.600000,,ninety-four equals ninety-four to make it one wait no one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,5,0.0,6,00:12:57.600000,00:13:01.200000,yeah I don't understand why they do three over two because I think,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,5,0.0,6,00:13:01.200000,00:13:02.300000,,it's not equal,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,5,0.0,6,00:13:02.300000,00:13:04.100000,because three I mean three over six,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,5,0.0,6,00:13:04.100000,00:13:05.600000,I mean my bad it's not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:19:30.900000,00:19:34.100000,,I think we should move the x over negative five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:19:34.100000,00:19:35.400000,,so I think we should pause filler should probably,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDS,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:19:36.300000,00:19:38.100000,to the right side of left side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:19:39.100000,00:19:39.800000,,to the right side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:19:40,00:19:42,okay so then we just add twelve I mean,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:19:42,00:19:43.600000,,so yeah we can subtract seventeen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:19:44.100000,00:19:45.300000,subtract seventeen then yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:19:46.200000,00:19:54.300000,,okay so subtracting seventeen we would get pause filler negative ninety no negative hundred negative a hundred,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:19:54.300000,00:19:57.600000,right yup negative one hundred,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:19:57.700000,00:20:02,,negative one hundred equals let's see pause filler,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:20:02.100000,00:20:05.800000,,it would be forty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:20:05.800000,00:20:08.700000,,because we're moving over to the eleven six,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:09.200000,00:20:11.700000,,so if we subtract eleven we just multiply,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:11.700000,00:20:12.500000,thirty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:13.100000,00:20:13.400000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:13.600000,00:20:16.200000,and then you would get pause filler twenty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:16.200000,00:20:17.400000,,that's forty-three right no,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:17.400000,00:20:19,,because we're adding it,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:19,00:20:21.600000,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah you're adding yeah yeah so forty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:21.600000,00:20:24.500000,,so forty-three forty-three over three x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:25.100000,00:20:28.300000,so negative one hundred equals forty-three over three x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:20:28.800000,00:20:51.900000,,all right so negative one hundred pause filler so negative one hundred time three over forty-three so negative a hundred time three is negative three hundred over forty-three equals x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,6,00:20:35.200000,00:22:29.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:20:53.300000,00:20:55.300000,I'll see if you do that right yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:20:55.300000,00:21:03.600000,and then just yup yup that's correct nine all right,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:21:03.600000,00:21:05.400000,pause filler let's do the same thing that we did last time,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:21:05.400000,00:21:08.900000,and just get this on the left side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:21:09,00:21:12.600000,,yeah it would be easier though so fourteen times four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:21:12.600000,00:21:14.600000,,let's see fourteen times four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:21:14.600000,00:21:22.300000,,so we're like we'll do it fourteen four so sixteen thirty-one fifty-six,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:21:22.600000,00:21:23.600000,so fifty-six,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:21:23.600000,00:21:27,,yup makes sense because it's seven times eight,,,,,,EV,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:21:27.100000,00:21:27.600000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:21:32.100000,00:21:32.400000,you're right,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:21:32.400000,00:21:38.800000,,okay fifty-six so I mean it could be minus nineteen minus fifty-six over four pause filler,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,5,00:21:39.800000,00:21:43.700000,no it's just fifty-six minus nineteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,5,00:21:44.200000,00:21:49.500000,,no ninety-six over pause filler nineteen minus fifty-six because we're subtract fourteen y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,5,00:21:49.900000,00:21:55.300000,I'll just write this out really quickly because here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,5,00:21:55.500000,00:22:01.600000,once you get here left over is three and then three so thirty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,5,00:22:02.700000,00:22:07,,so negative thirty-three because we're subtracting yeah okay okay pause filler,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,5,00:22:07,00:22:08.400000,so negative thirty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,6,00:22:09.300000,00:22:12.100000,,yeah plus fifty-five so we should get that to the other side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,6,00:22:12.500000,00:22:15.200000,and it's over y right I mean over four right,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,6,00:22:15.500000,00:22:27.400000,,yup all right and then we add fifty or sorry subtract fifty-five so then thirty-five minus thirty-four pause filler,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,6,00:22:27.400000,00:22:28.700000,so nineteen or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,8,0.0,6,00:22:28.700000,00:22:31,,it's one twenty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,9,0.0,1,00:22:29.500000,00:25:09.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,9,0.0,6,00:22:31,00:22:32.600000,,so it would be negative twenty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,9,0.0,2,00:22:32.900000,00:22:47.600000,,so negative thirty-three over four y equals twenty-one okay twenty-one okay,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,9,0.0,2,00:22:47.600000,00:23:00.200000,,and that means that we just have to subtract or multiply by twenty-one times pause filler four over negative three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T1 ,9,0.0,2,00:23:00.400000,00:23:03.200000,,because we can cancel out the negatives so yeah,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:43.600000,00:29:56.300000,,you can do it but never know pause filler on (inaudible) which I couldn't get to work for like a year now,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:56.300000,00:29:57.400000,,I don't know how to use it,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:57.700000,00:30:03.300000,,and pause filler things that are a little more in the gaming end are kind of like (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:03.300000,00:30:23.800000,,it's a good natural select simulator definitely could be used in your class,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:25.600000,00:30:28.800000,,(inaudible) my teacher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,0,00:30:31,00:30:55,yeah it is very interesting how like natural selection work and stuff like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,0,00:30:55.200000,00:30:56.800000,,yeah (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,0,00:30:59.800000,00:31:05,,hard to observe in this kind of reality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:31:09,00:31:18.200000,,because pause filler things tend to live a long time annoying you for a long time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:31:18.400000,00:31:21.700000,well and the changes are pretty slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:31:22.100000,00:31:32.800000,,yeah well the reason they're still slow is because everything is really ridiculous in long time bacteria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:31:32.900000,00:31:34.300000,,it's easy to find the (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:31:50.800000,00:31:58.700000,or is there anything like same things like that where like we are immune to now but we are like,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,1,00:32:01.400000,00:32:13.200000,,susceptible looks like it's going to start hey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,1,00:32:34.400000,00:32:35.300000,,oh I'll make sure not to do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:32:37.300000,00:32:44.200000,all righty hi there thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:32:48,00:32:51.500000,pause filler let's see it's on black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:32:52.300000,00:32:52.800000,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:32:54.700000,00:32:55,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:32:55.800000,00:33:06.900000,,yeah (inaudible) interesting pause filler I guess you could do this two ways,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:07.300000,00:33:12,,you could pause filler reciprocal everything,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:12.800000,00:33:15,,or you could multiply it by x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:15,00:33:17.600000,,and then divide it by twenty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:17.600000,00:33:18.900000,,I recommend just reciprocaling everything,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:18.900000,00:33:21.600000,,it's the same thing but you just yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:22.500000,00:33:24,all right let's do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:25.500000,00:33:29.800000,,so basically you're seeing the process right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:30.400000,00:33:30.700000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:31.100000,00:33:35.300000,,you multiply x which make this five x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:36.900000,00:33:39.100000,,and you just move this back to where the x was,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:40.900000,00:33:43.400000,,because that makes it reciprocal basically,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:44,00:33:46.900000,so it would be point five x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:47.400000,00:33:50.600000,,equals one and then you divide it by thirty-one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:50.600000,00:33:54.100000,,and then it would be going to,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,2,S2 ,,,2,00:33:55.100000,00:34:00,and then you get x equals one over twenty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,3,00:34:00.500000,00:34:11.100000,,yup all right negative thirty over y minus seventeen equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,3,00:34:11.100000,00:34:15.700000,,it looks like that's where the equal signs,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,3,00:34:15.700000,00:34:17,yeah I'll (inaudible) so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,3,00:34:17,00:34:17.200000,,yeah (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,3,00:34:17.200000,00:34:17.800000,add something,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,3,00:34:18.800000,00:34:21.900000,,good that would be pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,3,00:34:21.900000,00:34:22.600000,eighty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,3,00:34:22.900000,00:34:34.400000,,yup and now I guess you could reciprocal it,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:34:34.400000,00:35:00,mm-hmm wow so two hundred negative two hundred forty over y,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,4,00:35:03.300000,00:35:04.600000,,yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,S2 ,,,3,00:35:08.500000,00:35:15.800000,and equals negative three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,4,00:35:10.900000,00:52:59.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:11.800000,00:36:24.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:16.600000,00:35:18,,wait actually I'm not sure about that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:18.800000,00:35:20.300000,wait equal like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:20.300000,00:35:22.400000,,I'm not sure about that entire process,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:22.400000,00:35:27.800000,,because if you can't multiply that you'd be dividing that,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:27.800000,00:35:31.300000,yeah yeah it will be one x so,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:31.300000,00:35:32.600000,I mean y,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:34.200000,00:35:38.300000,and then we'll just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:38.300000,00:35:44.200000,oh and then we would multiply it to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:45.500000,00:35:46.200000,,there's number two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:49.900000,00:35:55.300000,I think I did something wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:56.200000,00:35:56.400000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:57.700000,00:35:59.300000,oh I know I did wrong I pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:35:59.600000,00:36:01.600000,,you can just divide it by negative three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:36:01.900000,00:36:07.100000,no I did it yeah you divide it by negative three by eight,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:36:07.100000,00:36:09.300000,yeah I forgot to switch it though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:36:09.800000,00:36:11,,well maybe yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:36:11.700000,00:36:13.100000,yeah you see I'm supposed to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:36:13.200000,00:36:16.200000,,I guess it would just be y equals negative three divided by eighty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:36:18.100000,00:36:18.200000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,1,0.0,Na,00:36:20.100000,00:36:24,,that was way more complicated than this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,6,00:36:24.700000,00:40:12.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,Na,00:36:25.900000,00:36:34.700000,yup and then we got pause filler twenty well,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:36:39.700000,00:36:45.600000,you don't get twenty fifteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:36:46.400000,00:36:49.100000,what's eighty divided by three twenty-four,,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:36:49.400000,00:37:25.400000,,no I can actually probably look it up pause filler eighty oh god damn it okay oh no equals negative twenty-six point six is six,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:37:25.800000,00:37:27.100000,,I don't think it can be simplified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,

11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,4,00:37:54.300000,00:37:57.300000,,pause filler okay I've scratched up fifty-four and pause filler,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,4,00:37:58.200000,00:38:00.600000,,let's see how you do it pause filler,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,4,00:38:02.300000,00:38:04.200000,,and five minus eleven is six right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:38:20.700000,00:38:28.800000,and then multiply it by both sides sixty-two k divided by four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:38:30.200000,00:38:33.200000,,yup that sounds good,,,,,,,CF,,,,UL,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:38:33.200000,00:38:45.900000,and then four divided to sixty-two would it be fifteen times no thirty-two,,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:38:47.100000,00:38:49.100000,,what sixty-two,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:38:49.500000,00:38:52.100000,yup six eighteen times,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:38:52.600000,00:38:53.300000,,sixteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:38:59.600000,00:39:01.900000,,and how about that number four,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:39:02.200000,00:39:02.600000,by four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:39:06.100000,00:39:06.800000,,sixteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:39:08.200000,00:39:09.800000,with that k equals sixteen,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:10.200000,00:39:12.500000,,is that right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:12.500000,00:39:13.900000,,I think so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:14.200000,00:39:17,yeah that's why you're supposed to get k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:17,00:39:19.100000,,wait isn't that sixty-two over there,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:20,00:39:21.500000,yeah it is so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:21.500000,00:39:23.700000,,it placed sixty-four oh well,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:23.800000,00:39:25.700000,,no then I don't think it does,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:27.900000,00:39:30.200000,well compute on sixty-four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:32,00:39:39.700000,so it will be like fifteen point yeah,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:39:39.700000,00:39:42.500000,,I would leave you with one over k equals sixty-two over four,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:39:45.500000,00:39:46.600000,are we even doing this right,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:39:46.600000,00:39:48.800000,I feel like we're doing something wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:39:48.800000,00:39:49,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:39:49.600000,00:39:53.300000,because like we get sixty-two,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:39:55.100000,00:39:57.500000,,it gets difficult when you don't have like a calculator now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:39:57.500000,00:40:00.900000,,because then you spend so much time looking up on the map,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:01.700000,00:40:09,,and it's hard to do in the algebra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:09,00:40:09.200000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,2,0.0,6,00:40:09.200000,00:40:12.400000,,sixty divided by four could be simplified to thirty-one divided by two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:40:12.200000,00:43:23.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:40:12.400000,00:40:14.100000,,and that's simplified again,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:40:14.100000,00:40:18,,so one over k equals thirty-one over two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:40:18,00:40:23.200000,,which means that k equals thirty-two one over thirty-two but no yes,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:40:23.400000,00:40:25.200000,oh yeah yeah yeah because we can just,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:40:25.200000,00:40:27.800000,,no two over thirty-one two over thirty-one there we go,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:40:28.300000,00:40:30.500000,so k equals two over thirty-one,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:40:30.500000,00:40:34.200000,because that's the possible (inaudible) in that scenario,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:40:34.200000,00:40:34.400000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:40:35,00:40:36.200000,yup yeah I forgot about that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:40:36.200000,00:40:39.300000,we could just where we're used fraction,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:40:39.300000,00:40:43.300000,all right let's move on so this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:40:42,00:40:43,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:40:43.300000,00:40:49.200000,,we could just divide by negative fourteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:40:45,00:40:45.800000,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:40:49.400000,00:40:53.300000,no no it's what I'm supposed to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:40:54.300000,00:40:55.100000,,what does it say to do,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:40:55.200000,00:40:56.200000,,which one is this,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:40:57,00:40:57.200000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:40:57.700000,00:41:01.300000,,definitely multiply both sides by x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:41:01.300000,00:41:05.700000,,but you can also just like divide it by fourteen and then,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:41:05.800000,00:41:08.100000,that's what you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:41:08.100000,00:41:11.500000,,yeah and then you get one (inaudible) reciprocal,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:41:12.700000,00:41:27.600000,all right so pause filler multiply by both sides pause filler no calculator two hundred and ten divided by fourteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:41:27.600000,00:41:33.100000,,pause filler they can both be reduced by seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:41:34,00:41:40.400000,,so that would be the same thing as pause filler thirty over two fifteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:41:40.400000,00:41:44.400000,yeah if we reduce it by seven because seven keep going,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:41:45.200000,00:41:57.200000,,fourteen twice and two hundred ten thirty times I believe it's thirty over two pause filler fifteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:41:58.100000,00:42:02,so yeah so fifteen so y equals fifteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:42:02.700000,00:42:07.100000,,yup no one over y equals fifteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:42:07.800000,00:42:08.200000,one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:42:09.100000,00:42:10.500000,,so y equals fourteen over fifteen,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:42:10.500000,00:42:10.900000,,I'm pretty sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:42:11.900000,00:42:13.400000,so y equals negative fifteen,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:42:13.500000,00:42:19.200000,,yeah no y over no pause filler y equals negative one over fifteen,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:42:20.600000,00:42:23.800000,,because with the reciprocal of the y you have the reciprocal of fifteen too,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:42:24,00:42:26.900000,yeah yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:42:27.100000,00:42:29.200000,,and that's I guess what you end up with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:42:30,00:42:36.800000,you have to reciprocal everything all right over five let's see,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:42:37.400000,00:42:39.900000,,hundred thirteen equals five over x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:42:40.200000,00:42:45.400000,,so I definitely get that to the other side so thirty-two seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:42:45.400000,00:42:46,you add it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:42:46.300000,00:42:58.800000,so one thirty-seven equals over x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:42:59,00:43:00.800000,and then multiply the reciprocal,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:43:00.800000,00:43:01.400000,,I guess one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:43:01.500000,00:43:03.300000,,you divide it by five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:43:03.400000,00:43:06.500000,or yeah it's technically what you're doing anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:43:06.500000,00:43:12.100000,well then I think that's all you got for one twenty yes,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDS
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:43:12.100000,00:43:14.100000,,divide by five and then,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:43:14.300000,00:43:15.500000,I don't think you can simplify,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:43:15.500000,00:43:18.800000,,so x equals pause filler five over a hundred (inaudible),,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:43:19.500000,00:43:19.700000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:43:23.100000,00:43:24.800000,,no no it's the other way around,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:23.500000,00:45:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:26.300000,00:43:29.600000,,because right now right now this is true one,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:29.600000,00:43:32.200000,,or yeah this is true right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:32.300000,00:43:34.700000,,you have to make it so the x is on top,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:34.700000,00:43:35.700000,,so it's a whole number,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:43:36.300000,00:43:42.600000,,you have to make it so that x equals five over (inaudible),,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:43:42.600000,00:43:44.400000,oh huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:43:45.700000,00:43:48.700000,,x equals five over a hundred and five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:43:48.700000,00:43:51.700000,oh yeah yeah a whole number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:43:52.400000,00:43:57.100000,,yeah because of the Ys its x is over one,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:43:57.100000,00:43:59.600000,,hey what do you have here,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:00,00:44:01.800000,pause filler what would be easier,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:02.500000,00:44:04.700000,,I think it would be easier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:04.900000,00:44:05.900000,,they're both over x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:06.100000,00:44:09.800000,,so it would be easier to move pause filler the smaller one to the other side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:09.900000,00:44:13,,so I think we should move three x to the right three over x to the right,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:13.600000,00:44:14.600000,and that would be yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:14.600000,00:44:17.100000,,and that would be fifteen over x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:19.800000,00:44:24.700000,,and if we move eleven to the other side by negative in it (inaudible) now pause filler,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:25.800000,00:44:27.700000,it would be positive,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:28,00:44:29.800000,,no we got,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:29.800000,00:44:32.900000,oh yeah so go to the left,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:32.900000,00:44:35,so I mean it's only negative but,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:35,00:44:38.400000,,yup between negative a hundred and twelve,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:44:38.800000,00:44:39.700000,yeah thirteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:44:41.800000,00:44:43.700000,,wait now I think it would just be a hundred and three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:44:45.500000,00:44:53.800000,yeah a hundred and three and pause filler just multiply the reciprocal,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:44:54.400000,00:44:57.100000,so you're just dividing by fifteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:44:57.100000,00:44:59.100000,,yup and then you're moving the x over,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:44:59.100000,00:45:00.700000,I think you're done right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:45:00.900000,00:45:04.200000,,well yeah but you also have to do pause filler put,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:45:04.200000,00:45:05.400000,,so the x is on top,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:45:07.100000,00:45:09.200000,,which means x equals fifteen,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:45:09.200000,00:45:10,over negative one o three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:45:10.100000,00:45:11.100000,,yeah negative one o three oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:45:11.500000,00:45:18.500000,,okay I think I'm giving you the answers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:45:18.900000,00:45:21.900000,well I could write down the answers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:45:21.900000,00:45:29.400000,,yeah I'll just get rid of all that (sfx),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:45:34,00:45:41.800000,fifteen I mean I understand negative one three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:45:41.800000,00:45:42.600000,pause filler let's see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:45:42.800000,00:45:43.500000,let's do this pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:45:44.500000,00:45:46.500000,,it could be easier again to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:45:47.300000,00:45:48.400000,,oh crap we're wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:45:48.400000,00:45:50.800000,for the last one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:45:51.300000,00:45:54.200000,,no yeah for the last one because we'd be subtracting it,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:45:54.200000,00:46:01,,it would mean pause filler nine over pause filler x equals nine over a hundred and three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:46:01,00:46:03.300000,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:46:03.400000,00:46:04.500000,,oh we almost made that mistake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:46:05.100000,00:46:07.900000,oh shoot yeah because we added it yeah,,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:46:07.900000,00:46:09.500000,because yeah there's a positive there,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:46:09.500000,00:46:10.900000,so you should be subtracting it oh crap,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:46:11.500000,00:46:13.100000,so nine it would just,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:46:13.100000,00:46:15.500000,,I don't think that changes any of our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:46:15.500000,00:46:17.200000,yeah we'll just change fifteen to a nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:46:17.200000,00:46:17.700000,that's all we do,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:46:17.700000,00:46:18.700000,,yup nine there we go,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:46:18.700000,00:46:19.500000,I got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:46:20.200000,00:46:20.600000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:46:20.700000,00:46:36.200000,let's see if I can just go back go back go back go back go back go back nine over negative one over three yeah those negatives man we're almost true yup,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:46:36.400000,00:46:36.700000,,(inaudible) man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,4,00:46:36.800000,00:46:41.600000,all right so yes pause filler we got to subtract,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,4,00:46:41.600000,00:46:42.800000,,oh yeah so we're going to move this,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,4,00:46:42.900000,00:46:44.400000,,make sure we don't have to make the same mistakes,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,4,00:46:44.400000,00:46:45.900000,,so make sure it's eight over x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,4,00:46:46.900000,00:46:51,eight over x equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,5,0.0,4,00:46:52,00:46:53.500000,,oh and this one is nice because again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:46:52.200000,00:49:40.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:46:53.500000,00:46:56,,because we'll have positive numbers on both sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:46:56.400000,00:46:57.100000,this is true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:46:57.200000,00:46:58.400000,this is very true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:46:58.900000,00:47:00.400000,,so we can subtract the twenty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:00.500000,00:47:07.400000,,add sixty minus twenty-five is pause filler forty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:07.600000,00:47:10.400000,I think one twenty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDS
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:10.600000,00:47:13.200000,,I think it's forty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:14.100000,00:47:15.500000,,I mean thirty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:15.500000,00:47:19.800000,yeah thirty-five and then just over eight,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:21.900000,00:47:22.200000,,yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:22.500000,00:47:25.200000,divided by eight what kind of equals that it's pen that's crazy,,,,,OSQ,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:26.300000,00:47:32.300000,does it equal to yup does equal five yeah,,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:32.300000,00:47:33.800000,,yeah no no no that would be great,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:33.800000,00:47:40.500000,,that would be forty yeah thirty-five going to eight or eight going thirty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:40.500000,00:47:42.200000,so we just leave it as that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:42.300000,00:47:45.100000,so x equals eight over thirty-five,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:45.300000,00:47:46.200000,,yup there you go,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:46.200000,00:47:48.400000,,you got it,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:50.400000,00:47:53.200000,,pause filler I left my free mystery just for last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:47:54.200000,00:48:00.300000,to look back pause filler well let's subtract this on this side so over there,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:48:00.300000,00:48:04.900000,so we just get one over x equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:48:05,00:48:07.800000,and unfortunately this is going to be negative,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:48:08,00:48:09.200000,so it's going to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,2,00:48:09.400000,00:48:13.700000,,pause filler negative one o three again negative one o three one common number,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,2,00:48:13.700000,00:48:28.100000,negative one o three divided b one and then we get just x equals negative oh no just one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,2,00:48:28.100000,00:48:29.900000,,well you can say negative one over one o three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,2,00:48:29.900000,00:48:32,yeah I think it just looks better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,2,00:48:32.200000,00:48:36.100000,and that's our (inaudible) equal sign,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,2,00:48:36.100000,00:48:36.600000,,equals yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:48:38.600000,00:48:43.900000,last problem pause filler I'm assuming this isn't equal right here again,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:48:45.200000,00:48:46.700000,,remember that one is negative five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:48:46.700000,00:48:48.300000,,so you can add this one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:48:48.500000,00:48:49.100000,yeah it is negative,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:48:49.100000,00:48:53,so just be eleven x over x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:48:53,00:48:55.400000,and then we can add,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:48:55.400000,00:48:58.100000,,yeah you can add the one o nine too so,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:48:58.100000,00:49:01.100000,yeah well no no no we can't,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:49:01.100000,00:49:03.100000,because this is going on this side,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:49:03.800000,00:49:05.500000,so this has to be going on that side,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:49:05.500000,00:49:05.900000,,okay you're right,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:49:06.800000,00:49:08,,and then we'll subtract it,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:49:08.400000,00:49:10.200000,so then subtract it so then pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:49:10.400000,00:49:12.200000,,negative three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:49:12.200000,00:49:17,yeah three so it would be negative three hundred and forty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:49:17.400000,00:49:17.500000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:49:19.200000,00:49:31.900000,negative three hundred forty divided by eleven so x equals eleven over,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:49:33.400000,00:49:37.500000,we could see negative to the matter three hundred and forty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:49:38.200000,00:49:42.500000,,yup I think we got this and pause filler,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,6,00:49:41.100000,00:50:53.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:49:42.700000,00:49:46,,stop look at this okay,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:49:46.600000,00:49:54.100000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:50:21.400000,00:50:21.600000,,good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:50:23.600000,00:50:24.600000,all right I'm on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:50:25.600000,00:50:27.800000,,well he's already on that page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:50:28,00:50:29.300000,,it's continuous for some reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:50:29.900000,00:50:33,,okay so we're on page thirteen right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:50:33.300000,00:50:33.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:50:36.900000,00:50:39.100000,,because yeah it goes on to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,6,00:50:39.300000,00:50:41.600000,,so there's like a bonus round,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,6,00:50:42.600000,00:50:45.500000,all right so you see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,6,00:50:45.600000,00:50:50.800000,,yup tell me what you haven't seen before actually yeah kind of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,6,00:50:50.800000,00:50:53.700000,,because we have constants or we have coefficients,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,6,00:50:53.700000,00:50:58,so the first thing we should probably do is to get twenty onto the other side,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,6,00:50:58.100000,00:50:59.200000,so we get seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,8,0.0,6,00:50:59.300000,00:51:01,,so we subtract twenty yeah seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:00.800000,00:51:47.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,6,00:51:01.300000,00:51:02.700000,and then we can just add this,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,6,00:51:02.800000,00:51:06.300000,,yeah so then it would be twelve over three x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,6,00:51:06.500000,00:51:09.400000,,that has to be reduced to four over x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:09.900000,00:51:16.200000,three x so over two yeah and let me just yeah reduce it by three so then four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:16.500000,00:51:16.700000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:17.200000,00:51:18.500000,so four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:18.500000,00:51:19.400000,,so four over x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:19.700000,00:51:21.700000,and then we multiply that again,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:22.200000,00:51:23.100000,I'll just do this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:23.300000,00:51:26.300000,just like explain it four x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:27.300000,00:51:30.500000,and then multiply that by seven right no no,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:30.500000,00:51:31.900000,,so we'll divide yeah,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:32.200000,00:51:32.600000,divide,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:32.600000,00:51:33.800000,,seven over four,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:34.600000,00:51:36.200000,so seven over x equals seven over four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:36.800000,00:51:37.800000,,x equals four over seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:38,00:51:41.900000,four yeah yeah yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:41.900000,00:51:46.700000,,yeah well that's good,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:51:46.700000,00:51:47.300000,oh boy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,4,00:51:47.600000,00:52:53.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:51:48.100000,00:51:50.200000,,pause filler what's that okay okay pause filler,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:51:50.200000,00:51:50.900000,I'm freaking out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:51:50.900000,00:51:53.700000,,we can pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:51:54,00:51:55.700000,just divide by,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:51:56,00:51:57.400000,,yeah I mean pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:51:57.900000,00:51:59.900000,don't you just divide it by two,,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:52:00.900000,00:52:01.800000,,we used to (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:52:02.200000,00:52:03.800000,,now we'll make it easier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:52:05.100000,00:52:08.800000,your reciprocal so it would be like,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
11,2,T2 ,10,2.0,4,00:52:09.100000,00:52:13.500000,,yeah yeah yeah yeah in fact I know how to get this,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,

12,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:37:02.600000,00:37:04.300000,,yeah by subtracting here,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:37:05.200000,00:37:09.800000,thirty-six and then plus two k right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:37:09.800000,00:37:16.900000,,pause filler no I think it was thirty-six plus,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,IDS,

12,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:37:21.900000,00:37:25.300000,subtract thirty-six to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:37:26.100000,00:37:31.600000,and that's negative fifty equals two k,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:37:31.600000,00:37:42.400000,and then divide by two with negative twenty-five equals k,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

12,1,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:38:21.600000,00:38:25.300000,and then four equals two b,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,1,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:38:26.600000,00:38:28.100000,you can divide by,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:05:14.600000,00:05:15.600000,,mm-hmm yeah test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:05:17.700000,00:05:28.600000,we just had a test on (inaudible) multiply that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:05:28.700000,00:05:36.900000,,oh so you guys are doing like simple one like compound interest,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:05:37,00:05:40.500000,yeah what and (inaudible),,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:05:40.600000,00:05:45.500000,,oh yeah yeah yeah functions and we had like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:05:45.900000,00:05:48.600000,,pause filler but like one of our chapters it was like the worst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:05:48.600000,00:05:51.100000,,we had to learn them twenty-four different formulas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:05:52,00:05:53.900000,,and thatÀ_s all we have four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:05:53.900000,00:05:55.800000,,because like it was just so horrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,4,00:05:55.800000,00:06:00.400000,,and he didn't tell us that we're going to have to memorize it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:00.600000,00:06:06.300000,,but then I ended up memorizing it anyways just to be safe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,IDQ,
12,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:06.300000,00:06:08.100000,,because they tell you there was like a sheet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:08.100000,00:06:15.600000,,but you want to make sure that you knew well enough so that pause filler so that we didn't have to look back later in life so we just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:15.600000,00:06:17,,pause filler he didn't let us use that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:18.200000,00:06:18.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:20.700000,00:06:25.200000,,in eighth grade pause filler I do like geometry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,5,00:06:25.200000,00:06:32.800000,,do you guys do geometry in eighth grade or seventh grade,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,QE,,,,

12,2,S1 ,,,5,00:06:49.200000,00:06:53.800000,yeah so (inaudible) geometry in eighth grade (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,6,00:07:20.200000,00:07:25.600000,,it's like pause filler I was supposed to be advanced with my math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:25.800000,00:07:36.100000,,but pause filler I was like my brother didn't want me going up to his grade I remember that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:08:09.600000,00:08:19,okay so we have three sevenths,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:08:19.200000,00:08:22.100000,,oh three sevenths x equals yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,3,00:08:23,00:08:25.800000,okay so (inaudible) we just want them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
12,2,S1 ,,,0,00:08:26.300000,00:08:28.100000,,okay what you have to do is pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,0,00:08:28.100000,00:08:30.800000,,since you try and get the x alone pause filler okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,S1 ,,,0,00:08:32.400000,00:08:37.300000,,maybe thatÀ_s good okay thank you yeah okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,2,T1 ,6,0.0,5,00:24:23.100000,00:24:29.300000,,so the negative six seventh minus y sixty-one I mean pause filler so you need to do plus sixty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,6,0.0,5,00:24:29.400000,00:24:32.100000,,so you do twenty-five plus sixty-one which equals pause filler,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,6,0.0,5,00:24:32.100000,00:24:37.100000,,I'm sorry eighty-six eighty-six plus y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDA,

12,2,T1 ,6,0.0,5,00:24:53.200000,00:24:54.600000,,let's just minus y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
12,2,T1 ,6,0.0,5,00:24:54.600000,00:24:56.200000,,that would be a lot easier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,

12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:24:57.600000,00:25:00,yeah we know eighty-six is on this side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:25:00,00:25:04.800000,,mm-hmm so you have eighty-six on the right-hand side and yeah just,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:25:04.800000,00:25:07.200000,,pause filler and you minus y on the right side too,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:25:07.200000,00:25:10,,and you get pause filler so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:25:10,00:25:24.900000,,you get negative six over seven two y equals eighty-six yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:25,00:25:26.800000,,and then what you do is you have to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:26.900000,00:25:31.800000,well by subtracting by y I think,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:31.800000,00:25:32.800000,(inaudible) subtract it,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:32.800000,00:25:34.700000,,oh yeah so I add y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:34.700000,00:25:36.400000,,you subtract y so yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:36.400000,00:25:40.600000,,so it's just six sevenths equals eighty-six oh wait,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:40.600000,00:25:43.700000,,no so you're subtracting six sevenths,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:43.700000,00:25:45.800000,well wait we're subtracting y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:46,00:25:46.200000,,yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:46.800000,00:25:48.400000,well we're subtracting y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,6,00:25:49.100000,00:25:53.200000,then thatÀ_s well the answer would be one seventh y,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:25:53.200000,00:25:57,,oh yeah because you're left with pause filler the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:25:57,00:25:59.200000,,because you got okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:25:59.600000,00:26:01.400000,,because you subtract the y,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:26:01.400000,00:26:04,because (inaudible) oh you're subtracting,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:26:04,00:26:11.600000,so that basically (inaudible) subtracting y so basically (inaudible),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:26:11.900000,00:26:12.200000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:26:15.300000,00:26:16.100000,,pause filler yeah I understand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:26:16.100000,00:26:19.200000,,because actually I added it,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:26:19.300000,00:26:22.900000,,and I understand which led me to completely on our own track,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:26:22.900000,00:26:27.500000,yeah so it's negative fifteen yeah negative fifteen (inaudible),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:26:28,00:26:32.400000,and then we're going to take the reciprocal of that,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:26:32.400000,00:26:38.700000,,the reciprocal pause filler negative fifteen over seven y is pause filler seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:26:38.700000,00:26:46.100000,,oh it's like negative seven over fifteen which is like pause filler basically the same thing,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:26:46.100000,00:26:49.500000,,because it doesnÀ_t matter where like the minus is,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:26:49.800000,00:26:52.600000,,so you have the y on the one side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:26:52.700000,00:27:02.500000,,so you have y equals eighty-six times,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:27:02.500000,00:27:06.100000,seven over negative fifteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:27:11.200000,00:27:12.200000,,so you have y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:27:12.800000,00:27:17.200000,,so y equals eighty-six minus negative seven over fifteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:27:17.500000,00:27:19.200000,,okay so we're there now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:27:19.500000,00:27:24.700000,,and pause filler we could do eighty-six over one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:27:25.100000,00:27:29.600000,,the negative seven minus one equals negative seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:27:29.600000,00:27:30.100000,multiply,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:27:34.200000,00:27:39.700000,,multiplying negative seven times one and eighteen times one is the same thing,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:27:39.800000,00:27:43,well we're going to multiply (inaudible),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:27:43.200000,00:27:57.400000,,oh yeah the reciprocal okay yeah so then eighty-six times negative seven okay which is pause filler eight-six times wow (laughter),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:28:42.800000,00:28:52.800000,oh thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,3,00:52:49,00:52:51.400000,,pause filler thatÀ_s what I would do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,1,00:52:51.400000,00:53:02,,you know on the right side you do pause filler seventy-three plus thirty-eight plus x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,1,00:53:03.100000,00:53:09.100000,well even if we're multiplying we still do that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,1,00:53:09.100000,00:53:11.700000,,yeah because we're multiplying by x plus thirty-eight,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,1,00:53:12.400000,00:53:16.600000,,so it's seventy-three time x plus thirty-eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,1,00:53:16.700000,00:53:19.900000,,so what I think is easier is that you add them together,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,1,00:53:19.900000,00:53:21.200000,,because there's that x,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,1,00:53:22.700000,00:53:22.900000,,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:53:22.900000,00:53:33.900000,and then you get negative two equals one hundred eleven x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:53:33,00:53:34,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:53:34,00:53:36,so twenty divided by one hundred eleven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:53:36,00:53:44.200000,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:53:41.100000,00:53:54.200000,,one hundred eleven yeah and x equals negative two over a hundred and eleven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:53:54.500000,00:53:54.700000,yep,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,

12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,4,00:54:14.100000,00:54:17.500000,well so pause filler so I'd have to simplify this well (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,4,00:54:17.500000,00:54:19.300000,,mm-hmm I can do that yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,1,00:54:20.800000,00:54:52.600000,yeah times two hundred twenty-five over x and nine divide (inaudible) wait equals ten x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:54:53.200000,00:55:17.100000,so there (inaudible) you get two hundred eighty-five x (inaudible) equals one seventy-seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
12,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:55:17.200000,00:55:22.500000,,mm-hmm you just have to multiply by,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,

16,1,S1 ,,,5,00:04:48.500000,00:05:04.500000,okay so this is kind of like the same thing pretty much ouch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,S1 ,,,5,00:05:05.700000,00:05:10.500000,so pretty much add here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,S1 ,,,5,00:05:10.900000,00:05:13.200000,you add this eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:16.400000,00:05:22.900000,that really worked but all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:22.900000,00:05:23.300000,I love it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:23.300000,00:05:28.600000,and then from that you get eight equals fifteen plus eight so,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:28.800000,00:05:29.400000,,twenty-three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:29.700000,00:05:44.700000,yeah so okay cool twenty-three yeah so that's turmoil kind of the same thing as the last one,,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:05:44.800000,00:05:47.200000,okay so this is kind of the same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:05:47.200000,00:05:51.900000,but just you also track and still add so pretty much wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:05:59.500000,00:05:59.900000,,six,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:06:01.800000,00:06:16.200000,oh great okay yeah actually all right okay so oh man okay so basically divide here and then yeah divided by thirty-four,,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:06:09.900000,00:23:34.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:06:16.500000,00:06:20.200000,so x equals twenty-one,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:06:20.200000,00:06:21.100000,,there's a calculator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:06:21.100000,00:06:21.400000,there is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:06:29,00:06:30.900000,,bless you bless you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:06:31.400000,00:06:36.300000,thanks okay I (inaudible) the calculator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:06:36.900000,00:06:38.600000,because I think there's going on over there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:06:38.800000,00:06:40.200000,okay we're done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:06:40.200000,00:06:40.700000,pause filler x equals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:06:40.700000,00:06:40.900000,pause filler this is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:06:40.900000,00:06:44.200000,okay so x equals five,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:06:44.700000,00:06:47.400000,,what because forty five times five equals two twenty,,,,CA,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:06:51.500000,00:06:57.900000,yeah pretty much so we get,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:06:57.900000,00:06:58.600000,all right how do I,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:06:58.800000,00:07:05.700000,okay so pretty much in this first you want to add this,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:07:08.300000,00:07:13.900000,and then you get this,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:07:14.800000,00:07:16.400000,I don't know what happened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:07:16.400000,00:07:16.800000,hold on pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:07:16.800000,00:07:24.900000,okay and then we get pause filler thirteen five so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:07:25.100000,00:07:27.800000,okay that was pretty bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:07:30,00:07:31.900000,but I was close enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:07:31.900000,00:07:32.900000,and then we get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:07:32.900000,00:07:44.300000,that is equals to forty-one plus nine which is fifty okay,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:07:44.500000,00:07:56,and then pretty much divide that out from here for thirteen because of really going with fifty okay so three and pause filler,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:07:55.800000,00:09:00.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:07:56,00:08:03.800000,oh I think thirteen something yeah okay so pretty much the next problem,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:08:07.800000,00:08:14.700000,so this is kind of like the same thing that we had before,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:08:14.700000,00:08:19.100000,so I'll start off by subtracting this,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:08:23.200000,00:08:32.400000,and then pause filler divide by this six,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:08:33.400000,00:08:35,and you get it four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,5,00:08:35.300000,00:08:40.500000,okay so this is kind of like the same thing,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:08:40.500000,00:08:45.900000,so different pause filler adding this twenty-two so so I guess,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:08:46.400000,00:08:53.800000,pause filler sixty-two yeah equals this fifteen k four and a two fifteens,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:08:53.800000,00:08:56.800000,so yeah this is like the same thing for now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:08:56.800000,00:08:58.100000,so to subtract this,,,,OSQ,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:08:58.100000,00:08:59.600000,,well I didn't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:08:59.900000,00:09:02.400000,,we'll subtract it,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:09:01,00:10:03.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,3,00:09:02.600000,00:09:02.800000,what,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,3,00:09:03.700000,00:09:10,,no I was just doing in my head,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,3,00:09:10,00:09:12.200000,okay so x equals pause filler equals three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,3,00:09:12.200000,00:09:19.100000,okay so this one is just a little bit different but pretty much the same thing,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,3,00:09:19.700000,00:09:36.500000,so you just start off by subtracting this,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,3,00:09:40.400000,00:09:42,so now you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:09:42.100000,00:09:45.800000,so now you just kind of divide it by two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:09:45.800000,00:09:49.500000,and you get p okay three halves,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:09:49.900000,00:09:57,oh so this is like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:09:58.300000,00:10:03.200000,this is like pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:10:03.400000,00:10:07.300000,pause filler just subtract this,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:10:03.900000,00:13:12.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:10:10.300000,00:10:23.100000,so you get a negative ten equals seven k minus sixty-eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:10:24.700000,00:10:25.900000,now you just add ten,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:10:26,00:10:27.300000,oh wait add sixty-eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:10:31.400000,00:10:40.700000,so you get fifty-eight equals seven k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:10:42.900000,00:10:51.900000,so k is equal to eight,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:10:55.900000,00:11:13,okay well I guess we're left to do this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS

16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:05.100000,00:20:05.900000,,nineteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:06.500000,00:20:06.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:09.400000,00:20:13.900000,,and x equals,,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:14.400000,00:20:16.400000,nineteen,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:16.400000,00:20:21.300000,,because nineteen oh I didn't know that three was negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:22.400000,00:20:24.600000,oh wait wait oh so it's twenty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:25.200000,00:20:25.600000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:26,00:20:26.700000,so you just add it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:27,00:20:33.800000,okay hold on so just change this yeah pretty much yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:36.100000,00:20:52.800000,,all right now this right here negative y plus eighteen equals twenty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:53.100000,00:20:54.700000,,so hold on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:54.700000,00:20:57.200000,,let me do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:20:57.200000,00:20:59.300000,just subtract the eighteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:21:00.900000,00:21:02.600000,,okay subtract eighteen for both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:21:02.600000,00:21:03.300000,,so you would,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:21:03.500000,00:21:06.300000,so you get negative y equals five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:21:07.100000,00:21:11.400000,but then you can just throw a negative one to the other side to make it y equals negative five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,9,1.0,Na,00:21:11.700000,00:21:15,but I'm not sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:21:13.900000,00:23:29.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:21:22,00:21:30.100000,,y equals twenty-three,,,,CA,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:21:30.100000,00:21:38.500000,yeah negative y equals,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:21:38.500000,00:21:46.200000,yeah so y equals negative five okay pause filler,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:21:48.100000,00:21:51.500000,,so here you would add k to both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:21:51.500000,00:22:01.900000,right so then we get negative fourteen equals thirty-six plus two k eighty-two k and then pause filler,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:01.900000,00:22:16.800000,,oh hold on because I need to pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:16.800000,00:22:17.700000,oh no no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:17.700000,00:22:20.900000,,see it would be negative forty equals,,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:21.100000,00:22:23,thirty-six plus two k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:23.400000,00:22:23.900000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:25.100000,00:22:25.800000,and then pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:25.800000,00:22:38.500000,,so two k and then you would subtract,,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:38.700000,00:22:39.800000,thirty-six,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:40.100000,00:22:40.600000,,from both sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:40.600000,00:22:45.500000,yeah so then it becomes pause filler okay pause filler fourteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:45.500000,00:22:52.500000,okay so we got fourteen equals thirty-six is,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:52.500000,00:22:59.200000,pause filler oh it's fifty negative fifty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:22:59.600000,00:23:02.600000,I guess k equals negative,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:23:02.600000,00:23:08,oh two k equals negative fifty and then pause filler so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:23:08,00:23:11,,divide that by a two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:23:11,00:23:40,yeah so k equals negative twenty-five,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:23:40,00:23:41.100000,,all righty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:23:41.700000,00:23:43.600000,yeah pause filler same set of things add b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:23:43.600000,00:23:46.900000,,it would be seventeen equals,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:23:47.200000,00:23:50.100000,thirteen plus two yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:23:50.100000,00:23:50.600000,,two b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:23:50.600000,00:24:18.600000,yeah and then subtract thirteen to get four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:24:18.600000,00:24:37.400000,and then divide the four by two to get to b equals two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:24:42.500000,00:24:52.600000,so basically just divide the pause filler the negative nine to get g equals negative,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
16,1,T1 ,10,1.0,Na,00:24:52.700000,00:24:55.200000,,well you know that too negative is like a positive right,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:24:58.700000,00:25:01.700000,,so it would just be negative nine,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,

16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:25:37.500000,00:25:44.200000,so seven times two equals negative eight y divide,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:25:44.200000,00:25:45.800000,,divide that by eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:25:47.600000,00:26:05.100000,yeah so it's nine all right yeah,,,,CA,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,

16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:26:11.400000,00:26:25.300000,yeah I guess nine so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:26:25.400000,00:26:30.400000,,it would have to and sixty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:26:30.400000,00:26:31.800000,,so just pause filler I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS,
16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:26:31.800000,00:26:34.500000,so subtract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:26:34.500000,00:26:37.500000,because that's a positive sixty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:26:37.900000,00:26:40.900000,the fourteen x is negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,1,T1 ,11,0.0,Na,00:26:40.900000,00:26:52,but sixty-five is positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:46.600000,00:06:48.200000,,we were actually pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,4,00:07:23.100000,00:07:29.700000,,three over seven x equals one right there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,4,00:07:31.700000,00:07:31.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,4,00:07:32.800000,00:07:35.400000,,do you see three over seven x equals forty,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,4,00:07:44.200000,00:07:46.700000,say that again,,,,HR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,4,00:07:46.700000,00:07:47.800000,,do you see,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,6,00:07:47.800000,00:07:51.300000,,three over seven x equals forty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,6,00:07:52.500000,00:07:53,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,6,00:07:53,00:07:53.100000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,6,00:08:09,00:08:10.700000,yeah we just checked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,6,00:08:10.700000,00:08:13.500000,it's like oh I can't full screen that okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,6,00:08:13.700000,00:08:15.400000,all right so I'm good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,6,00:08:16.100000,00:08:18.200000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:24.600000,00:08:25.100000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:25.200000,00:08:26.200000,,all righty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:26.900000,00:08:34.200000,do you see the problem,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:34.500000,00:08:35.200000,,yeah do you see,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,5,00:08:35.400000,00:08:40.700000,,I can make sure that (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,3,00:08:42.200000,00:09:00.500000,,pause filler okay yeah already we're ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,3,00:09:01.500000,00:09:04.500000,all right so I guess I'm tutoring first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,3,00:09:05,00:09:07.500000,so I guess I'll just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,3,00:09:08.800000,00:09:14.600000,pause filler I'll just start okay so first yeah okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:09:14.800000,00:09:22.800000,first we have to multiply this by oh what,,,,OSQ,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:09:24.100000,00:09:25.500000,,I don't know (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:09:25.700000,00:09:33.300000,by pause filler seven thirds so that these cancel out,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:09:33.300000,00:09:36.600000,and this is cancelled out,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:09:36.600000,00:09:42.300000,but then we have to multiply this by damn it by seven thirds,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,SV,,,
16,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:09:47.600000,00:10:08.400000,so now oh god I have to do forty-eight times seven twenty-eight so two hundred eighty divided by three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,,,3,00:09:52.300000,00:26:45.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:09:53.100000,00:11:53.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:10:09.400000,00:10:14.100000,and that's kind of how you get the answer pretty much,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:15.800000,00:10:37.600000,so yeah we're wrong okay,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:37.600000,00:10:39.600000,well my thing when we're off center,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:39.600000,00:10:41.800000,but I'm just going to rewrite the problem,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:42.100000,00:10:44.400000,,or I think that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:44.500000,00:10:45.800000,,this is hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:45.800000,00:10:50.500000,okay let's pretend that's an x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:50.600000,00:10:52,because that would make (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:52.800000,00:10:56,so here's kind of like the same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:10:56.200000,00:11:02.300000,we're just going to multiply by eight thirds thirds,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:11:02.300000,00:11:10.400000,and then same thing over here,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:11:10.400000,00:11:13.700000,hold on wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:11:13.700000,00:11:15.500000,I'll get it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:11:15.500000,00:11:21.900000,okay so we have a hundred twelve thirds pretty much,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:11:22.500000,00:11:41.900000,so yeah that's like the same thing as the last one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:11:27,00:11:29,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,1,1.0,0,00:11:42.400000,00:12:00.300000,,so like that's a little bit three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,1,00:11:54,00:12:56.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:12:01.600000,00:12:04.500000,,you know why don't you divide twelve by three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:12:05.400000,00:12:11.600000,yeah but pause filler on the example sheets pretty much they left it like as a fraction,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:12:12.500000,00:12:15.700000,so that's just kind of what I've decided to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:12:17.300000,00:12:20.700000,okay so this one is actually centered which is kind of nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:12:21,00:12:25.100000,so first thing that I'm going to do is add eighteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:12:25.100000,00:12:32.800000,so we're going to get negative,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:12:37,00:12:40.700000,so that we're kind of doing the same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:12:40.700000,00:12:48.200000,negative two-thirds y equals fifty-two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,1,00:12:48.200000,00:12:50.500000,so we're going to multiply by three halves,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,2,1.0,1,00:12:56.100000,00:12:59.500000,and then this whole thing cancels,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:12:56.900000,00:15:06.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,1,00:13:00.300000,00:13:01.700000,I'm left with that,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,1,00:13:03.100000,00:13:08.500000,and then we have a y equals fifty-two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:13:08.500000,00:13:32.900000,a hundred four a hundred and fifty-six divided by two or pause filler y equals seven,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:13:32.900000,00:13:38,that's four seventy-eight I think,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:13:38,00:13:38.800000,,so (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:13:39.500000,00:13:45.100000,okay so yeah I'm just close enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:13:51.700000,00:14:02.800000,okay so we'll this year is kind of off centered too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:14:02.800000,00:14:03.600000,,yeah yes (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:14:03.700000,00:14:08.400000,well this is kind of hard because,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:14:08.400000,00:14:11.100000,pause filler I don't really know what that equals,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:14:12.500000,00:14:16.400000,so maybe I can like select it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:14:16.700000,00:14:19.300000,let me see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:14:25.800000,00:14:28.100000,maybe I can like copy and paste it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:14:28.100000,00:14:37.800000,we're just look through to see what I could do here no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:14:40,00:14:45.100000,okay I don't think I can do anything,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:14:46.300000,00:15:02.500000,so let's just move on and maybe like come back to this one nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,3,0.0,3,00:15:02.700000,00:15:32.600000,wait oh maybe I know this okay oh,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:15:06.300000,00:16:10.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:15:32.600000,00:15:35,okay did you get this now,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,3,00:15:37.100000,00:15:44.200000,okay all right so okay so first we're going to add the sixteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:15:52.800000,00:15:56.900000,so now we have three equals ten,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:15:55,00:15:56,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:15:57.200000,00:16:06.100000,yeah you have forty-seven equals three six x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:16:06.100000,00:16:13.300000,so we're going to multiply it by six thirds now,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:16:13.300000,00:16:15.400000,that crosses out,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:16:16,00:16:17.100000,that crosses out,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,1,00:16:17.100000,00:16:19.900000,we're just left with x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,1,00:16:20.600000,00:16:26.400000,so we have forty-seven equals x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,1,00:16:26.400000,00:16:28.900000,but this is multiplied by six thirds,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,1,00:16:30.100000,00:16:37.700000,so oh man so I have to multiply,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,1,00:16:38,00:16:41.300000,do you know what forty-seven times six is,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:16:49.100000,00:16:52.200000,,multiply seven (inaudible),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:17:23.100000,00:17:28.200000,okay so x equals ninety-four so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:17:28.800000,00:17:35,there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:17:40.800000,00:17:54.500000,okay so first we're going to subtract this forty-eight oh man close enough the,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:17:58.200000,00:17:59.300000,we're going to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:17:59.300000,00:18:07.700000,pause filler I know what this is ninety-seven minus forty fifty-seven forty-nine yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:18:08.400000,00:18:16.800000,so forty-nine equals negative twelve fifths y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:18:17.700000,00:18:26.700000,so I have to multiply it by five twelfths,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:18:39.100000,00:18:41.500000,and you're okay,,,,,,,,,,MCRP,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:18:41.500000,00:18:44.600000,so now we're going to get forty-nine times five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:18:45.200000,00:19:03.700000,so wait so two hundred forty-five sounds right yeah two hundred forty-five divided by twelve oh,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:19:03.700000,00:19:23.200000,okay so first I'm going to add this sixty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,6,0.0,4,00:19:08.800000,00:20:52.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,6,0.0,2,00:19:31.300000,00:19:43.200000,so I have negative six sevenths y equals twenty-five plus five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,6,0.0,2,00:19:43.700000,00:20:11.900000,so eighty-six plus this y so let me see this real quick,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,6,0.0,4,00:20:12.500000,00:20:21.200000,pause filler okay so I guess we're going to subtract this y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,6,0.0,4,00:20:27.200000,00:20:38.900000,so if we were to multiply this we get seven six y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,6,0.0,4,00:20:39,00:20:42.400000,so we get left with seven sixth,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,6,0.0,4,00:20:42.400000,00:20:43.800000,but we have to keep the y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,6,0.0,4,00:20:43.800000,00:20:46.600000,because if we were to multiply we'll have another y,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,6,0.0,4,00:20:46.800000,00:20:48.300000,so we have this,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,6,0.0,4,00:20:48.300000,00:20:53.200000,y equals eighty-six and then,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:20:52.500000,00:23:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:56.100000,00:20:58.800000,okay so that y is the same,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:20:58.800000,00:21:07,it's eighty-six times seven oh man so yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:21:09.500000,00:21:27.200000,six hundred and two six hundred and two divided by six it's what y equal to,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:21:28.200000,00:21:54.300000,so moving onto okay so all right so first I'm going to add this eighty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:21:54.400000,00:21:55.700000,so now we have this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:21:56,00:22:10.800000,eleven x equals one hundred plus ten thirds ten thirds x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:22:10.800000,00:22:12.600000,so what we're going to do here is now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:22:12.600000,00:22:14.400000,we're going to subtract this x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:22:18.300000,00:22:34.600000,so now we're left with negative eleven equals one hundred x plus this pause filler ten thirds,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:22:34.600000,00:22:43.300000,but we're going to make this into a three tenths three tenths x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:22:43.600000,00:22:44.300000,and then we have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:22:44.300000,00:22:51.700000,pause filler let me see oh wait this oh okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:22:51.700000,00:23:01.600000,so now we have to also multiply this by three times,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:23:02.400000,00:23:05.300000,this should not,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:23:09.100000,00:23:14,so this should also be multiplied by three tenths,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,7,0.0,3,00:23:16.600000,00:23:17.600000,so then we get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,4,00:23:17.200000,00:25:54.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:23:18.200000,00:23:22.100000,so this would cancel and just give us oh wait not,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:23:22.100000,00:23:25,I'm not doing something wrong here,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:23:26.400000,00:23:40,okay so basically we're going to three three over ten equals one thousand over three x so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:23:40,00:23:58.700000,okay so this is kind of well it actually it like the same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:23:58.700000,00:24:05.600000,so then I don't have to deal with negative,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:06.200000,00:24:12.500000,so I'm going to subtract this thirty-five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:12.500000,00:24:14.900000,,did you see her,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:15.600000,00:24:17,she what,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:19.900000,00:24:22.500000,,no never mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:24.500000,00:24:31.400000,okay oh it's thirty-four oh,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:31.400000,00:24:35.200000,,oh well (inaudible) how do I solve this,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:35.900000,00:24:38.900000,pause filler to undo (inaudible) (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:39,00:24:40.100000,,that was fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:42.500000,00:24:46.400000,so subtract this thirty-four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:57.300000,00:24:57.600000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:25:04.300000,00:25:10.400000,all right so pause filler yeah we're going to subtract this thirty-four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:25:10.400000,00:25:12,and we're going to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:25:16.100000,00:25:21.200000,pause filler what am I doing twenty-one right yeah,,,,OSQ,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:25:22.300000,00:25:37.200000,so you have nineteen over four y plus twenty-one equals fourteen y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:25:39.300000,00:25:40.900000,that was like really weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:25:40.900000,00:25:43.200000,it's like eight people just walked into this room,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:25:44.800000,00:25:47.700000,and they're like oh yeah we're looking at the carpet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,4,00:25:47.800000,00:25:49.800000,and I was like all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,4,00:25:49.800000,00:25:53.100000,that was kind of weird pause filler okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,8,0.0,4,00:25:53.500000,00:25:56.200000,,oh they're weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,3,00:25:54.500000,00:29:39.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,4,00:25:57.200000,00:26:00.800000,yeah so now we're going to subtract y from each side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,4,00:26:02.600000,00:26:08.700000,so I have nineteen fours y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,4,00:26:09.400000,00:26:14.300000,plus twenty-one equals pause filler fourteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,3,00:26:17.200000,00:26:22.800000,oh wait that shouldn't be there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,3,00:26:22.800000,00:26:27.600000,that should be four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,3,00:26:27.700000,00:26:31.900000,well when we multiply this out it would be four nineteen slot,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,3,00:26:38.900000,00:26:42.100000,so then well that really didn't go very well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,3,00:26:42.100000,00:26:43.100000,so then we're going to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,3,00:26:43.100000,00:26:45.200000,basically I'm going to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,3,00:26:45.200000,00:26:47.200000,you and I shouldn't do this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,1,00:26:47.200000,00:26:51.700000,I'm going to subtract with fourteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,1,00:26:53.100000,00:26:59.200000,so we have four nineteenths y equals seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,1,00:27:00.100000,00:27:07.800000,and now basically we talked again improper fractions so or just the fraction in general so twenty-eight nineteenths y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,4,00:27:07.800000,00:27:26.400000,oh so that's the answer to this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,4,00:27:30,00:30:09.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,4,00:27:32.900000,00:27:44.600000,so okay so we now have a much bigger and more complicated problem then I really wanted to have but whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,1,00:27:46.300000,00:27:56.400000,so first we're going to subtract this two hundred and two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,1,00:27:56.400000,00:28:02.500000,so three three four minus two hundred is one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,1,00:28:07.200000,00:28:08.100000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,1,00:28:08.300000,00:28:08.800000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,1,00:28:09.600000,00:28:10.600000,hi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,0,00:28:43.600000,00:28:52.600000,okay so pause filler on the Scribbler board some things are kind of centered to like bullet point a little bit centered to the left,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,0,00:28:52.600000,00:28:55.300000,so I just move the screen over so that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,0,00:28:56,00:28:57.600000,okay all right I was just making sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,0,00:28:57.600000,00:28:59.400000,because I could really see the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,0,00:28:59.600000,00:29:01,so I just moved it over,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T1 ,9,0.0,3,00:29:24.800000,00:29:25.200000,nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16,2,S2 ,,,0,00:34:07.200000,00:34:09.900000,like is there a way I can turn the mic off or,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,0,00:34:09.900000,00:34:17.100000,I sometimes am having trouble hearing him but from both part,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,0,00:34:17.100000,00:34:18.400000,pause filler it's working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,4,00:34:22.400000,00:34:27.900000,yeah pretty much I think I can do that just a little bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,4,00:34:28.100000,00:34:29.300000,okay thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,4,00:34:48.200000,00:34:48.500000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,6,00:34:49.900000,00:34:56.400000,,oh you have to understand that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,6,00:34:56.400000,00:35:02.300000,you're there to make sure (inaudible) solving problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,6,00:35:02.400000,00:35:03.200000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,6,00:35:03.600000,00:35:13.100000,,well so here again (inaudible) all right so pause filler here we have x equals twenty-seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,6,00:35:13.800000,00:35:16.100000,,so we should multiply both sides by x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,6,00:35:16.200000,00:35:18.400000,yeah seems like a good idea,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,LP,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,3,00:35:18.400000,00:35:24.800000,,and then we have one over twenty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,3,00:35:24.900000,00:35:31.200000,,and twenty-five equals (inaudible) twenty-five equals twenty-five x so (inaudible),,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,3,00:35:31.300000,00:35:36.500000,,so x equals one,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,3,00:35:37.200000,00:35:37.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,3,00:35:37.600000,00:35:37.700000,,oh (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,3,00:35:38.300000,00:35:40.100000,yeah it's basically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,3,00:35:40.400000,00:35:45.900000,you got to just do it now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,3,00:35:47,00:35:48.200000,I'll eat some more Skittles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,1,00:35:48.900000,00:36:00.900000,,wait oh sounds like (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,1,00:36:01,00:36:04.700000,pause filler yeah I got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,1,00:36:04.700000,00:36:08.200000,,I got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,1,00:36:08.200000,00:36:09.500000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,1,00:36:09.500000,00:36:10.600000,,all right and (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,1,00:36:11.200000,00:36:18.700000,right what was that in the background,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,2,00:36:20.100000,00:36:24,,oh did you hear it,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,2,00:36:24,00:36:26,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,2,00:36:26.700000,00:36:26.900000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,2,00:36:26.900000,00:36:29.300000,oh it sounded really weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,2,00:36:29.300000,00:36:33.500000,and I was like what,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,2,00:36:33.500000,00:36:36.400000,,yeah we add,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,2,00:36:37.900000,00:36:38.500000,yeah we add,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,2,00:36:38.700000,00:36:43.500000,,so it will be eighty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:36:43.500000,00:36:57.900000,yeah I want as well to just get a whole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:36:57.900000,00:37:02.100000,that might be good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:37:02.600000,00:37:08.100000,,yay (inaudible) y is multiplied by y to both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:37:08.300000,00:37:48.300000,,which will give us negative three over eighty equals eighty-five minus five (inaudible) equals minus negative three divided by eighty (inaudible) negative two hundred times forty y (inaudible),,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2,2.0,Na,00:37:34.500000,00:58:04.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,1,0.0,3,00:37:46.900000,00:38:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,1,0.0,0,00:37:48.300000,00:38:01.300000,yeah pretty much eight yeah because eighty times three is negative two forty so yeah,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,1,0.0,0,00:38:02,00:38:08.100000,,all right and then you would subtract fifty-four from both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,1,0.0,0,00:38:08,00:38:08.900000,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,1,0.0,0,00:38:08.100000,00:38:16.300000,,we'll let you calculate a little bit with something sixteen minus,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,1,0.0,3,00:38:16.300000,00:38:27,all right one sixteen sixty-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,1,0.0,3,00:38:27.200000,00:38:45.300000,,all right (inaudible) by k sixty-two k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,4,00:38:31.300000,00:41:04.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:38:46.200000,00:38:47.300000,so basically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:38:47.400000,00:38:58.100000,,four over sixty-two four divided by sixty-two would be,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:00.700000,00:39:11.300000,sixty-two divided by four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:11.300000,00:39:11.400000,,oh (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:11.800000,00:39:12.700000,I'll say that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:13.200000,00:39:16.900000,that's this way wait yeah wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:20,00:39:24.100000,just leave it as an improper fraction I guess or yeah,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:24.500000,00:39:27.500000,because sixty-two divided by four is fifteen and a half,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:28.400000,00:39:31.300000,,yeah so eight equals sixteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:31.600000,00:39:33.600000,yeah I guess pretty much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:33,00:39:35.500000,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:33.900000,00:39:35.500000,yeah wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:35.500000,00:39:42.900000,,so ten equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:44.400000,00:39:45.400000,,oh this is easy (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:45.400000,00:39:51.200000,,multiply both sides by y too much since,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:51.200000,00:39:58.400000,,then y equals negative forty-two equals ten negative fourteen divided by (inaudible),,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:39:58.400000,00:40:02.800000,two ten divided by fourteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:40:03.700000,00:40:11,,yeah negative fourteen divided by negative fourteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:40:12.600000,00:40:14.800000,pause filler negative fifteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:17.700000,00:40:22.400000,,okay so fifteen minus,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:24.400000,00:40:27.100000,yeah so add this twenty-four start,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:28.700000,00:40:29,,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:35.700000,00:40:38.700000,so then we get one thirteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:40.700000,00:40:42.300000,it's like one thirty-seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:42.500000,00:40:45.800000,does that sound right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:46,00:40:46.100000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,4,00:40:46.100000,00:40:50.700000,pause filler okay so one thirty-seven equals five over x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,4,00:40:50.700000,00:40:53.800000,that's weird because five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,2,0.0,4,00:40:53.800000,00:41:04.600000,we're given the one thirty-seven so,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,3,0.0,1,00:41:04.400000,00:42:44.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:41:06.100000,00:41:06.900000,,all righty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:41:08.800000,00:41:15.600000,yeah so mm-hmm okay pause filler well we have two negatives,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:41:35.100000,00:42:02.200000,so I guess we should add twenty-one to get thirty-nine pause filler to get negative eighteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,3,0.0,1,00:42:11.300000,00:42:22.900000,so yeah seventeen x minus eighty-two equal twelve x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,3,0.0,1,00:42:28.400000,00:42:38.600000,,okay and then and then x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,3,0.0,1,00:42:39.900000,00:42:42.300000,well I guess from here we have to like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,3,0.0,1,00:42:42.600000,00:42:43.400000,,add seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,3,0.0,1,00:42:43.400000,00:42:47.100000,no you can't add seven,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:42:44.500000,00:43:35.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:42:47.100000,00:42:49.700000,because those two things have variables,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:42:49.700000,00:42:55,so I guess we should subtract x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:42:55,00:42:57,,or add seventeen so,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:42:57.100000,00:42:58.800000,oh yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:42:58.800000,00:43:11.700000,,twenty-nine x which is twenty-nine x equals two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:12.500000,00:43:18,yeah oh gosh which would be nineteen x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:18.800000,00:43:21,or my god I'm trying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:21.800000,00:43:24.100000,I don't understand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:24.100000,00:43:24.500000,,yeah oh yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:26.500000,00:43:27.200000,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:27.400000,00:43:28.200000,,add eleven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:43:28.200000,00:43:35.500000,,I mean subtract eleven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,5,0.0,5,00:43:35.500000,00:44:56.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,5,0.0,4,00:43:35.500000,00:43:44.700000,actually before you do that pause filler it might be easier to add the ninety-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,5,0.0,4,00:43:44.700000,00:43:47.700000,so that we don't have to deal with a negative number,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,5,0.0,3,00:43:55.600000,00:44:17.900000,,all right (inaudible) well all right well all right ninety-two x plus ninety-two equals (inaudible),,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:44:17.900000,00:44:29.900000,,well it was ninety-two and ninety-three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,5,0.0,2,00:44:29.900000,00:44:37.500000,oh yeah so basically we have three x equals a hundred three plus twelve x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,5,0.0,5,00:44:38.400000,00:44:56.300000,so basically what we should do here is subtract the x from each side,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,5,0.0,5,00:44:56.300000,00:45:02.900000,so that we just get three equals a hundred and,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:44:57,00:47:07.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,5,00:45:04.200000,00:45:05.500000,,got it (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,5,00:45:06,00:45:06.900000,hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,5,00:45:06.200000,00:45:14.900000,,you just try x equals seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,5,00:45:15,00:45:15.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,4,00:45:15.900000,00:45:30.200000,,and we get twelve x equals eleven twelve x plus a hundred and thirty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,4,00:45:21,00:45:28.700000,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,4,00:45:30.300000,00:45:42.600000,,(inaudible) this would be one actually (inaudible),,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,1,00:45:43.400000,00:45:49.100000,yeah that's it,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,1,00:45:50.200000,00:45:57,,so we subtract sixty to both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,1,00:45:57,00:45:59,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,1,00:45:59,00:46:02.800000,hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:46:15,00:46:20.300000,mm-hmm you can do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:46:20.500000,00:46:24.400000,or I would actually subtract,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:46:25.300000,00:46:28.700000,pause filler I want to really subtract twenty-five just because,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:46:28.700000,00:46:29.600000,so we won't have negative,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:46:29.600000,00:46:32.600000,but it doesn't really matter because,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:46:32.600000,00:46:33.500000,,oh yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:46:33.500000,00:46:35.500000,all right because negatives are like,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:46:36.100000,00:46:40,they're really annoying but like,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:46:46.300000,00:46:54.900000,it's not the worst thing oh well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:46:58.800000,00:47:01.200000,so basically subtract (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:47:01.700000,00:47:28.200000,pause filler so again it was one yeah so one x plus thirty-five right,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,2,00:47:07.100000,00:49:50.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,2,00:47:28.500000,00:47:28.800000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,2,00:47:29.200000,00:47:40,yeah one x plus thirty-five equals nine over x or basically x plus six plus,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,2,00:47:40,00:47:46.400000,pause filler thirty-five yeah equals nine over x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:47:47.400000,00:47:50.800000,so I just subtract x from both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:47:50.800000,00:47:54.800000,and then you get,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:47:55,00:47:59.800000,I think that makes no sense to subtract these Xs,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:48:00.900000,00:48:01.900000,,(inaudible) or four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:48:02.500000,00:48:07.200000,yeah yeah pretty much you can do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:48:07.200000,00:48:11.400000,,or I should say ten x plus thirty-five would equal forty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:48:11.400000,00:48:17.200000,,x equals twenty-five,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:48:17.200000,00:48:27.400000,,I guess you could say that (inaudible) oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:48:59,00:49:10.600000,so yeah one o three plus ten over x equals nine over x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
16,2,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:49:15.500000,00:49:16.400000,,oh well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:06:06.700000,00:06:09.700000,x minus six equals thirteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:32.300000,00:07:40.100000,okay so in this problem how to solve it basically you want to get x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:40.100000,00:07:45.400000,you want to have x only on one side and all the content,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:45.400000,00:07:49.800000,so basically (inaudible) we got a variable attach them or x on the other side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:49.800000,00:07:53,so you want to get this negative six here,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:08.200000,00:08:09.700000,yeah so you want to add six,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:09.700000,00:08:21.200000,right so you know what that is or something on the other side,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDE
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:21.700000,00:08:25.900000,so when you add six to the other side what do you get,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:27.900000,00:08:29.800000,,pause filler nineteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:29.800000,00:08:36,yeah so you could get nineteen so if you have x minus six here,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:36,00:08:38,add six yeah x minus six in here,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:38,00:08:48.600000,also add six to thirteen x equals nineteen correct so next problem,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:51,00:08:52.900000,okay do you want to go to page two,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:53.900000,00:08:54.600000,,pause filler I'm here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:55.200000,00:08:57.800000,,fifteen equals negative eight plus eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:58.400000,00:09:02.100000,yeah so in this problem is like the last problem,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:02.100000,00:09:07.200000,we have a negative number a variable and a variable on the other side and an equal sign,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:07.500000,00:09:10.700000,so you want to get the negative eight over to fifteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:09:11.300000,00:09:22.600000,so since it's a negative what do you want me to do,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,2,1.0,1,00:09:14,00:10:19.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,2,1.0,Na,00:09:22.600000,00:09:23.100000,,add eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,2,1.0,Na,00:09:23.100000,00:09:32.100000,,probably on the other side would equal twenty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,2,1.0,Na,00:09:32.100000,00:09:37.700000,twenty-three yeah so three equals twenty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:09:37.900000,00:09:52.500000,,yeah so twenty-three equals eight okay okay,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:09:52.500000,00:10:00.300000,okay so the next problem we have seventeen equals k plus eleven right and same as the last two problems,,,,CA,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:10:00.300000,00:10:02.800000,we want to get that eleven over to the seventeen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:10:03,00:10:04.500000,but this time it's a positive,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,T1 ,3,1.0,1,00:10:36.200000,00:10:38.600000,because it doesn't need (inaudible) subtracted in,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,3,1.0,4,00:10:38.900000,00:10:42.600000,since we have forty-four times x equals two hundred twenty,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,3,1.0,4,00:10:42.600000,00:10:46.400000,we're going to be using either multiplication or division,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,3,1.0,4,00:10:46.700000,00:10:51.100000,since this is twenty-four times since this is multiplication,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,3,1.0,4,00:10:51.100000,00:10:54.700000,you get the forty-four over eight x solitary,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:11:53.400000,00:12:04.200000,wait x make I might have done that wrong or pause filler wait two twenty over four forty,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:12:04.700000,00:12:07.300000,I'd say never mind if I think I did that wrong,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,0,00:12:10.800000,00:12:16.400000,okay so two twenty over four forty is subtraction right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,0,00:12:16.600000,00:12:20.800000,okay pause filler you can keep two twenty over four forty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,0,00:12:20.900000,00:12:21,,oh I can,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,0,00:12:21,00:12:28.700000,,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,0,00:12:23.800000,00:12:26,okay so this is a fraction,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,0,00:12:26.100000,00:12:28,do you know about simplifying fractions,,AC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,0,00:12:28.700000,00:12:29.500000,,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,0,00:12:31.200000,00:12:36.700000,pause filler so basically simplifying is basically dividing,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:12:36.700000,00:12:39.300000,this is partly just that common numerator,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:12:39.300000,00:12:43.900000,and this probably is called the denominator by the same number,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:12:44.200000,00:12:48,so we know already that four forty is divisible by two twenty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:12:48,00:12:50.200000,so we do by both sides by two twenty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:12:50.200000,00:12:52.600000,that would be called simplifying fraction,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:12:52.600000,00:12:54,,one number (inaudible) just two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:13:13.500000,00:13:15.700000,so this is going to be a two-set problem,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:13:15.800000,00:13:20.600000,so here like all the other problems we have a negative nine here,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:13:21.200000,00:13:26.600000,and so we want to get this negative nine over to the constant side here or at this side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:13:26.900000,00:13:34.500000,so since it's negative what do you want to do,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:07.800000,00:14:09.100000,,it's forty-one so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:09.100000,00:14:11.900000,yeah okay so this is forty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:12.100000,00:14:13.200000,,so it would be,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:15.500000,00:14:16.800000,forty-one plus nine,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:25.200000,00:14:31.100000,okay this one is a good number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:31.100000,00:14:32.700000,this is forty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:14:35.100000,00:14:45.100000,,fifty divide each side by thirteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:14:53.400000,00:14:57.300000,,and what pause filler simplify again,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:14:58,00:15:00.100000,okay so I think in this problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:15:00.100000,00:15:03,it is because the denominator is a prime number,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:15:03,00:15:07.500000,and prime numbers are numbers that can only be divisible by one and itself,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:15:07.700000,00:15:09.800000,so we can actually simplify this anymore,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:15:09.800000,00:15:12.500000,just because thirteen isn't divided by anything,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:15:12.500000,00:15:15.800000,and we know that fifty cannot be divided by thirteen,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:15:16.300000,00:15:27.500000,so the answer would still just be fifty over thirteen,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:15:27.500000,00:15:28.500000,,okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:15:30.100000,00:15:38.200000,okay we have six x plus ten equals thirty-four and same as all the other problems,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:15:38.200000,00:15:41.500000,so we want to get this ten over to the thirty-four side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:15:41.800000,00:15:52.600000,so yeah we're going to subtract ten for both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:15:52.600000,00:15:59.200000,,six x equals thirty-four,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:15:59.800000,00:16:00.100000,yes,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:16:00.500000,00:16:01.700000,,so that would be four,,,,CA,,,,A,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:16:02.700000,00:16:03.900000,yeah x equals four,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:16:13.100000,00:16:13.700000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,6,1.0,6,00:16:16.600000,00:17:03.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,6,1.0,4,00:16:16.600000,00:16:21.900000,okay the next problem we have forty equals negative twenty-two plus fifteen k,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,6,1.0,4,00:16:21.900000,00:16:25.100000,so we're going to get that negative twenty-two over forty side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,6,1.0,4,00:16:25.400000,00:16:35.200000,so yeah add twenty-two to both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,6,1.0,6,00:16:36,00:16:41.300000,,pause filler this is sort of (inaudible) so sixty-two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,6,1.0,6,00:16:43.800000,00:16:45.300000,equals fifteen k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,6,1.0,6,00:16:47,00:16:57,,yeah and pause filler and what pause filler divide each side by fifteen,,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,6,1.0,6,00:16:57,00:16:57.100000,yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,6,1.0,6,00:16:57.100000,00:17:03.700000,,x I don't know if x equals on this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,6,1.0,6,00:17:03.700000,00:17:08.500000,so you have sixty-two divided by fifteen right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:17:04.100000,00:18:41.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:09,00:17:14.800000,and so first you want to check if there are any common pause filler,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:14.900000,00:17:21.400000,if there are any number that you can divide both sixty-two and fifteen by pause filler which so fifteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:21.400000,00:17:25.900000,you have one and fifteen and three and five as its factors,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:26.100000,00:17:29.700000,and none of them match sixty-two's factors,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:29,00:17:30,,denominators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:29.700000,00:17:32.200000,so this fraction actually can be simplified,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:17:32.500000,00:17:39.900000,so we just have k equals sixty-two over fifteen,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:17:41.200000,00:17:43,,all right so two pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:17:43.700000,00:17:47.100000,okay so here we have thirty-three,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:17:48,00:17:57,you go twelve plus seven x right and so same as always,,,,CA,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:17:57,00:18:01.200000,you want to get this constant over to the thirty-three side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:18:01.200000,00:18:08.100000,so yeah what you're doing is correct,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,6,00:18:08.100000,00:18:13.600000,,so it would be seven equals twenty-one,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,6,00:18:13.800000,00:18:13.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,6,00:18:15.200000,00:18:19.200000,,equals twenty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,6,00:18:19.200000,00:18:19.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,6,00:18:21.900000,00:18:38.600000,yeah correct okay so this next problem we have variables on both sides,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:18:39.200000,00:18:42.400000,so basically we want to get variables on one side only,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,8,1.0,1,00:18:41.800000,00:19:28.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,T1 ,8,1.0,2,00:18:51.600000,00:18:52.300000,divide them,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,8,1.0,2,00:18:53.300000,00:18:56.500000,so if you want to get this positive p over to here,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,8,1.0,2,00:18:57.100000,00:18:59.200000,yeah you would subtract p to both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,8,1.0,1,00:18:59.500000,00:19:21.300000,,and that would be fifteen equals fifty plus twelve,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,8,1.0,1,00:19:21.900000,00:19:33.100000,yes correct and then so from here you want to get twelve to the fifteen side if this is positive,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:19:28.700000,00:21:22.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,0,00:19:35.900000,00:19:40.800000,,this is very hard to solve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,0,00:19:43.600000,00:19:48.600000,so three equals two p,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,0,00:19:48.600000,00:19:49.100000,,yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,0,00:19:51.800000,00:19:54.800000,and just divide it by two each,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,0,00:19:52,00:19:54.800000,,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,0,00:19:55.400000,00:20:02.200000,,mm-hmm and so it would be like,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,0,00:20:02.800000,00:20:03.300000,,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,0,00:20:04.700000,00:20:05.400000,three over two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,0,00:20:05.400000,00:20:06.300000,,yeah I was going to say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,2,00:20:06.800000,00:20:10.100000,,like one and a half would be better pretty much,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,2,00:20:10.100000,00:20:12.100000,yeah p over two is one and a half so,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,2,00:20:12.100000,00:20:13.200000,,yeah so it doesn't matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,2,00:20:13.200000,00:20:15.700000,p equals one point five or three over two,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,2,00:20:15.700000,00:20:18.800000,it doesn't really matter what you put,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,2,00:20:18.800000,00:20:24.500000,,yeah next one,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,2,00:20:24.500000,00:20:29.100000,okay you have k minus ten equals eight k minus sixty-eight,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,2,00:20:29.500000,00:20:35.400000,and so the first step you want to move k over to the eight k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,2,00:20:35.800000,00:20:38.100000,so since this k is positive,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,3,00:20:40.300000,00:20:41.900000,yeah you would want to subtract,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,3,00:20:43.500000,00:20:53.500000,,negative ten equals seven k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,3,00:20:53.500000,00:20:57.800000,okay and so and all you go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:20:58.200000,00:21:11.500000,you want to isolate the variables,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:21:11.500000,00:21:16.600000,so you want to take this negative sixty-eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:21:16.600000,00:21:19.700000,and move it over here out of the variable side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,9,1.0,4,00:21:21.100000,00:21:30.800000,so you would want to add sixty-eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:21:22.700000,00:23:23.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:21:30.800000,00:21:35.600000,,so then I'll turn to pause filler positive pause filler fifty-eight,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:21:35.600000,00:21:35.900000,yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:21:36.700000,00:21:45,,so fifty-eight equals seven k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:21:49.100000,00:21:51.500000,,which means k equals eight,,,,CA,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:21:52,00:21:57.200000,,or now k is just fifty-seven,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:21:57.200000,00:21:59.400000,k equals fifty-eight over seven,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:21:59.400000,00:22:00,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,3,00:22:00.400000,00:22:16,because seven times eight is actually fifty-six not fifty-two,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,3,00:22:16,00:22:18.300000,,yeah absolutely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,3,00:22:19.900000,00:22:20.500000,oh okay (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,3,00:22:21,00:22:32.200000,,pause filler I'll just go get him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,3,00:22:34.100000,00:22:34.300000,okay yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:22:38.700000,00:22:57.300000,,they said just keep going on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:22:57.300000,00:22:57.700000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:23:06.300000,00:23:08,okay uh-huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:23:08,00:23:10,so twelve is intentionally blank,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:23:10,00:23:18.100000,and thirteen is our next problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:23:18.500000,00:23:19.200000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:23:20,00:23:33.200000,okay so we have r minus fifty-three equals two r minus fifteen right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:23:33.600000,00:23:37.900000,so as always we want to get this r over to here,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:23:45.800000,00:23:48,,so negative fifty-three oh,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:23:48,00:24:11.700000,okay so yeah you want to get this negative fifteen over to the negative thirty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:24:11.700000,00:24:19.200000,so yeah you want to add fifteen and if you have a negative number,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:24:19.900000,00:24:24.300000,and you want to add a positive number to that,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:24:24.600000,00:24:26.400000,you can think of it as,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:24:27.900000,00:24:29.500000,we have the negative number,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:24:29.500000,00:24:35.300000,and then you have this number minus this number,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,4,00:24:33.300000,00:26:44.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:24:36.200000,00:24:38.200000,,so this number minus this number,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:24:40.500000,00:24:42,okay so to say this is,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:24:42,00:24:43.600000,we have negative x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:24:43.600000,00:24:46.200000,and then you're adding a positive y to it,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:24:46.200000,00:24:54.300000,you can think of it as negative and an x minus y as long as y is less than x,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:24:54.700000,00:24:57,so in this case thirty-three would be x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:24:57.400000,00:25:03.600000,and y would be fifteen right since we're adding fifteen to negative thirty-three,,,,CA,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:03.700000,00:25:09.900000,,[so] it would be eighteen plus eighteen sixty-eight,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:09.900000,00:25:13.600000,yeah so it would be x minus five would equal to eighteen to,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:13.600000,00:25:14.800000,it would be negative eighteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:16.300000,00:25:22.900000,,yeah negative eighteen equals r,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:23.200000,00:25:29.400000,,so that means just r equals negative eighteen,,,,CA,,,,A,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:29.500000,00:25:36.100000,yeah okay problem fourteen we have negative forty-two plus u equals eight plus four u,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:36.700000,00:25:39.100000,and we still have a u here,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:39.400000,00:25:42.100000,so we want to move this u over to four u,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:42.200000,00:25:44,and this u is still positive,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:45.100000,00:25:47.800000,so we can still subtract u on both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:25:50.500000,00:26:10.800000,,ah negative forty-two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:26:12.500000,00:26:14.300000,and since we have this positive eight,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:26:14.300000,00:26:16.700000,we can still move it over to negative forty-two,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:26:18.200000,00:26:19.800000,,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:26:20,00:26:23.100000,so positive eight if you want to move it opposite to equal sign,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:26:24,00:26:25.400000,you want to do the opposite,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:26:26.500000,00:26:27.700000,so you want to subtract,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T1 ,11,1.0,0,00:26:31,00:26:33.700000,,so it would be negative fifty,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,

17,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:34:53,00:34:54.100000,,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:34:54.100000,00:34:57,and so divide that by two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:34:57,00:34:59.800000,we have negative twenty-five equals k,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:00.700000,00:35:07.800000,and so here we can just add b to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:07.800000,00:35:09.300000,,(inaudible) yeah that would be (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:10.400000,00:35:12.600000,and then we can now go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:12.600000,00:35:15,,(inaudible) to both sides and then we divide by (inaudible),,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:15,00:35:20.100000,okay so divide by negative nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:21.500000,00:35:37,,yeah and then (inaudible) forty-seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

17,1,T2 ,6,1.0,6,00:37:44.100000,00:37:46.500000,because this is divisible by three,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T2 ,6,1.0,6,00:37:46.500000,00:37:47.900000,,and so is that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T2 ,6,1.0,6,00:37:47.900000,00:37:49.700000,and this is also divisible,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T2 ,6,1.0,6,00:37:49.700000,00:37:55.600000,,so it would be twenty-five over thirty,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,

17,1,T2 ,7,1.0,4,00:38:13.400000,00:38:14.500000,,so you add p,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T2 ,7,1.0,4,00:38:14.500000,00:38:17.400000,,then you what subtract the fifty-two,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T2 ,7,1.0,4,00:38:17.400000,00:38:19.300000,that's nineteen minus,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,1,T2 ,7,1.0,4,00:38:19.700000,00:38:22.200000,so we would add sixteen to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,1,T2 ,7,1.0,4,00:38:22.200000,00:38:26,and then we have fifty-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:03:17,00:03:25.500000,,it's so weird obviously not to leave after,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:03:27.700000,00:03:38.200000,,this is our second time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:06:19.100000,00:06:19.800000,pause filler stylus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:06:25,00:06:32,okay so pause filler you want to start,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:06:34.200000,00:06:39.200000,,I don't leave the room (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:06:40,00:06:46.200000,okay so this is the same like all the last problems,,,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:06:46.600000,00:06:51.800000,you want to get the x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:06:51.800000,00:07:03.200000,okay so we want to get x over to one side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:03.300000,00:07:13.100000,and so just imagine this as like a whole number not three ahead of seven not a fraction,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:13.300000,00:07:16.300000,so if this was a whole number what would you do,,AH,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:16.300000,00:07:22.600000,,pause filler subtract I think yeah subtract,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDS,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:22.800000,00:07:40.400000,no because this since okay so when basically when you see a number and there's no sign in between,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:40.400000,00:07:43,this means multiplication,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:43,00:07:43.100000,,mm-hmm (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:43.100000,00:07:49.700000,yeah okay so basically when dividing with fractions you do something called the reciprocal,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,,,4,00:07:46.300000,00:27:54.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,2,00:07:46.500000,00:12:18.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:07:49.700000,00:07:54.700000,and so you know the numerator and the denominator right,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:07:54.700000,00:07:54.800000,,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:07:54.800000,00:07:59.400000,so the reciprocal is when you flip them,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:07:59.400000,00:08:06.300000,so like the reciprocal of this would be four over three or,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:08:06.300000,00:08:10.400000,,seven over four seven over four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:08:10.700000,00:08:14.200000,yeah seven over four I think and x,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:08:14.200000,00:08:15.400000,,I mean seven over three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:08:15.500000,00:08:24,yeah seven over three and so when dividing by a fraction multiplying by the reciprocal is the same thing,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:08:25,00:08:33.300000,so if you wanted to divide this forty by three over seven the same as multiplying forty by seven over three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:08:33.400000,00:08:39.800000,so now that you know that can you do this problem,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:08:39.800000,00:08:44.800000,,pause filler so multiply those sides by the reciprocal right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:08:45.100000,00:08:45.200000,yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:08:45.200000,00:08:50.800000,,oh my gosh that sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,0,00:08:53,00:08:55.200000,,yeah that sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,7,00:08:55.300000,00:08:56.800000,(laughter) so bad at writing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,7,00:08:56.900000,00:09:07.800000,,that is a three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,7,00:09:07.800000,00:09:08.500000,,that's three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,7,00:09:08.500000,00:09:10.600000,yeah that's a three (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,7,00:09:10.700000,00:09:14.800000,,that equals one right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,7,00:09:15.200000,00:09:15.900000,yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,7,00:09:16.700000,00:09:24.300000,,all right yeah and okay so one x all right,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,7,00:09:24.300000,00:09:25.700000,yeah one x equals,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:26.100000,00:09:29.100000,,equals pause filler forty-seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:29.100000,00:09:30.900000,,I mean forty time seven so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:30.900000,00:09:31.300000,,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:31.300000,00:09:33.100000,forty times seven over three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:34.500000,00:09:36.700000,,yeah you could just spell it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:37.400000,00:09:37.600000,what,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:37.600000,00:09:41.400000,,I said we can just write it that way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:41.900000,00:09:49,pause filler so basically you can't just have forty times seven over three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:49,00:09:50.300000,so what you can do,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:50.300000,00:09:53.900000,pause filler multiplying via fractions is really troublesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:09:54.600000,00:10:01.400000,so do you agree that forty is the same as forty over one,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:10:01.600000,00:10:02.200000,,uh-huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:10:02.200000,00:10:07.300000,and so when multiplying fractions what you want to do is,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:10:07.400000,00:10:09.200000,you want to multiply the two numerators and the two denominators,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:10:09.200000,00:10:12.900000,so we have forty times seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:10:13.700000,00:10:14.200000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,3,00:10:17.600000,00:10:22.900000,that's those yeah pause filler over three and that would be our answer,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,4,00:10:23,00:10:28.400000,because we're multiplying forty by seven over three,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,4,00:10:30.700000,00:10:31.500000,,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,4,00:10:31.600000,00:10:38.800000,and then so basically the last step would be just to simplify forty times seven (laughter),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,4,00:10:38.900000,00:10:44.100000,,okay so forty so four times seven is twenty-eight so two eighty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,4,00:10:44.100000,00:10:46.900000,yeah yeah so it would be two eighty over three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,4,00:10:46.900000,00:10:49.500000,,okay you don't have to write that down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,4,00:10:49.500000,00:10:50.300000,,I'll write that down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,4,00:10:50.300000,00:10:53.400000,,that's equals two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:10:53.600000,00:10:56.400000,,yeah it's not going to work out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:10:59.900000,00:11:02.700000,by the way two eighty is not divisible by three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:11:02.800000,00:11:05.500000,so you can just write twenty-three over three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:11:06,00:11:06.400000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:11:08.300000,00:11:14.400000,an easy way to know if something is divisible by three is to add up all of the digits,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:11:15.200000,00:11:17.400000,so you would add up two and zero,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:11:17.500000,00:11:22.600000,and if the sum is divisible by three then the number is divisible by three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:11:23.200000,00:11:30.400000,so that's basically it's a cool trick so the next problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:11:30.400000,00:11:31.100000,,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:11:31.100000,00:11:35.800000,so now that you know what to do with fraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,5,00:11:35.800000,00:11:51.900000,,okay so fourteen equals x so (inaudible) one k,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,2,00:11:56.500000,00:11:57.100000,yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,2,00:11:57.200000,00:12:01.400000,,and then you can just multiply the fourteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,2,00:12:10.900000,00:12:14.700000,yeah that's very hard (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,2,00:12:14.900000,00:12:16.500000,,it's really hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,2,00:12:17.100000,00:12:17.900000,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,1,1.0,2,00:12:18.400000,00:12:24.800000,,wait can we just do fourteen times three over eight,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,3,00:12:18.800000,00:15:10.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:12:24.900000,00:12:29.300000,pause filler remember reciprocal so reciprocal of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:12:29.300000,00:12:31.300000,,fourteen times eight over,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:12:31.300000,00:12:43.200000,yeah so fourteen times eight over three because it's fourteen over one so,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:12:43.200000,00:12:45.100000,okay do you know fifteen times eight,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:12:45.100000,00:12:50.400000,pause filler okay so you can take the eight and say it's a ten,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:12:50.400000,00:12:50.500000,,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:12:50.500000,00:12:55.100000,then you can solve it right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,3,00:12:55.300000,00:12:58.900000,you know fourteen times ten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,3,00:12:59,00:13:02.300000,,pause filler it's a forty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,3,00:13:02.400000,00:13:14.700000,okay so once you know that since eight is two less than ten that means that it's two fourteens less,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,3,00:13:15,00:13:18.100000,so what you can do is you can just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,3,00:13:18.100000,00:13:22.300000,,so one forty minus twenty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,2,00:13:22.700000,00:13:26.300000,yeah one forty minus twenty-eight is the same thing as fourteen times eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,2,00:13:26.300000,00:13:32.100000,,okay one forty minus twenty-eight so one forty minus twenty is one twenty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,2,00:13:32.100000,00:13:34.300000,,and then minus eight is one twelve,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,2,00:13:34.500000,00:13:42,yeah so it would be one twelve over three which is,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,2,00:13:42,00:13:43.500000,,oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,2,00:13:43.500000,00:13:47.400000,which is not divisible by three so what I can tell,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,2,00:13:47.500000,00:13:48.600000,,one twelve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:13:49,00:14:01.900000,I bet you are going to get to my problems is going to be all pretty numbers (laughter) like an octopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:14:02.100000,00:14:03.500000,,jeez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:14:03.800000,00:14:07.800000,that's not anything like I an octopus (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:14:08.100000,00:14:09.300000,,this is so hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:14:10.500000,00:14:19.700000,and that equals k okay next problem,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,4,00:14:19.900000,00:14:22.700000,,all right add eighteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,3,00:14:22.700000,00:14:37.500000,,so it will be negative two over three y equals pause filler seventy,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,2,1.0,3,00:14:37.900000,00:14:38.100000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,3,00:22:17.600000,00:22:18.500000,,mm-hmm so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,3,00:22:18.700000,00:22:27,and so basically when the y is like this you can think of it as one times y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,3,00:22:27.200000,00:22:34,and so you can also think of one as seven over seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,3,00:22:34.200000,00:22:47.800000,do you agree that the fraction is seven over seven also goes one over one,,ODQ,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,5,00:22:48,00:22:56.200000,so when you have negative six over seven and you're subtracting another seven over seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,5,00:22:56.300000,00:23:02.200000,so what actually what did you get here,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ

17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,2,00:26:39.800000,00:26:41.300000,yeah it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,2,00:26:41.300000,00:26:47.100000,okay so seven times a hundred is seven hundred right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,2,00:26:47.100000,00:26:47.500000,,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,2,00:26:47.500000,00:26:55.400000,and so the difference between that and six hundred nine is ninety-one right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,4,00:26:55.400000,00:27:05.500000,and so in ninety-one you can split ninety-one into twenty-one and seventy,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,4,00:27:05.500000,00:27:10.500000,which are both divisible by seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,4,00:27:10.500000,00:27:28.500000,so we have seven times a hundred minus seven times three minus seven times ten,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,4,00:27:28.700000,00:27:31.900000,so yeah the answer is basically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,4,00:27:32.400000,00:27:38.600000,you take all of these numbers,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,4,00:27:38.800000,00:27:47.100000,and then when you add them all out,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,3,00:27:47.200000,00:27:59.300000,so when you add a hundred negative three at negative ten,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,6,00:27:59.400000,00:28:28.400000,and basically what you get is the number that you multiply seven by to get six o nine,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,0,00:28:29.400000,00:28:56.300000,,okay so divided by thirteen equals pause filler what was it thirty-seven,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,0,00:28:57.300000,00:29:01,you know what,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T1  ,7,0.0,0,00:29:01.600000,00:29:08.900000,we just did it over here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ

17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:20.500000,00:29:36.200000,oh wait no because wait pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:36.700000,00:29:44.100000,,(inaudible) got the seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:44.200000,00:29:49,oh okay I did this wrong,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:49.900000,00:30:19,because we (inaudible) eighty-seven by a thirteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:19,00:30:20.800000,,yeah I think that's (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:21.400000,00:35:29.400000,okay by the way this is supposed to be twenty-five not just a random scribbles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:29.400000,00:35:29.500000,,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:29.500000,00:35:30.900000,okay eighty y equals negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:31.300000,00:35:35.600000,okay if I write extremely big maybe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:35.800000,00:35:36.500000,they don't work (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:37.800000,00:35:43.600000,okay next problem we have minus fifty-four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:43.600000,00:35:45.200000,,so subtracting it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:45.500000,00:35:49.700000,one twelve wait so it's one twelve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:35:50.800000,00:35:59.800000,and then we have sixty-two yeah sixty-two (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,2,T2 ,2,1.0,Na,00:36:08,00:36:18.100000,the thing is I don't think it's a problem of the touchpad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
17,2,T2 ,2,1.0,3,00:36:18.300000,00:36:26.500000,I think it's the problem of the actual the pause filler the scribbler thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
17,2,T2 ,2,1.0,3,00:36:26.500000,00:36:30.600000,,and actually the website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,

17,2,T2 ,2,1.0,3,00:36:32.300000,00:36:35.900000,I figured it out what I've been doing wrong this entire time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,2,1.0,3,00:36:37,00:36:39.700000,I was holding the pen backwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,2,1.0,3,00:36:42.300000,00:36:43.700000,,(inaudible) at this right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:36:44.300000,00:36:52.600000,I was holding it like this with that (laughter) like finally for choosing out so yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:36:53.100000,00:36:58.800000,it's writing a lot to me there now (laughter) oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:37:01,00:37:02.600000,,wow pretty easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:37:02.600000,00:37:08.100000,yeah I don't have to multiply fractions or anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDE
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:37:08.100000,00:37:11.800000,I just have to take this y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:37:12,00:37:23.700000,and leave it to here it's like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:37:24.200000,00:37:25.800000,and this is seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:37:26.200000,00:37:39.200000,so we have negative two over thirty which can simplify the one of forty fifteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:37:39.300000,00:37:42.900000,,can't you find a lot of (inaudible),,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:37:43.500000,00:37:45.400000,,because you know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:37:45.400000,00:37:47.900000,,pause filler and I have to leave half of this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:37:50.100000,00:37:59.400000,okay so that's a four pause filler one thirty-three over one thirty-seven oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:38:00.700000,00:38:19.200000,yeah it's not a nice number okay let's yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:38:15.500000,00:38:51.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:38:20.600000,00:38:24.400000,,pause filler when you have thirty-nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:38:25.300000,00:38:31.900000,I'm going to take this step by step,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:38:32,00:38:34.100000,,no I'm going to say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:38:34.100000,00:38:43.500000,,let me add the thirty-nine to get that seventeen number x five so mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:38:43.600000,00:38:44.800000,normally I would,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS
17,2,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:38:44.900000,00:38:52.500000,but see this is a lot easier to understand right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,4,1.0,3,00:38:52.600000,00:38:56.200000,and then I would add thirty-nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
17,2,T2 ,4,1.0,3,00:38:56.300000,00:38:59.300000,basically what I did is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,4,1.0,3,00:38:59.400000,00:39:12.800000,I think the x (inaudible) twelve over x from a fraction by just multiplying by multiplying x's to both sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS
17,2,T2 ,5,1.0,2,00:39:00.500000,00:39:46.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,5,1.0,3,00:39:12.900000,00:39:25.800000,so it makes it a lot easier to understand for me mm-hmm nine eighteen yeah eighteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,5,1.0,2,00:39:27.500000,00:39:33.300000,so five x equals eighteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,5,1.0,2,00:39:33.700000,00:39:42.400000,and yes x equals eighteen oh (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,5,1.0,2,00:39:42.400000,00:39:51,,yeah so yeah (inaudible) first well not many of it in that way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,6,0.0,4,00:39:46.800000,00:40:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:39:51,00:39:54,I will need to like exercise denominators and like (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:39:54.100000,00:39:54.400000,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:39:54.900000,00:40:13.200000,that's a ninety-two that's not a twelve okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:40:13.400000,00:40:18.700000,,well I thought it was a twelve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,6,0.0,2,00:40:19,00:40:23.600000,I look at it like it was like a twelve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,6,0.0,4,00:40:23.800000,00:40:34.200000,pause filler two hundred two that's supposed to be an o,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,6,0.0,4,00:40:35.600000,00:40:45.700000,and that's just nine x (sfx) right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,6,0.0,4,00:40:45.800000,00:40:54.100000,okay I'm just going to say the hardest things to write are threes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,6,0.0,3,00:40:54.500000,00:41:08.900000,if you try and squiggle it too fast it either is just going to end up as a straight line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:40:55.300000,00:42:21.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:41:09,00:41:18.200000,,mm-hmm so just want to x so you just brought up all along like x plus sixty equals nine x plus twenty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:41:19,00:41:24.300000,,and then solve those for you and so not the fractions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,7,0.0,3,00:41:24.400000,00:41:32.200000,yeah no one likes looking at fractions which is like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:41:32.300000,00:42:02,if they're like easy like it's one fourth people (inaudible) to like point twenty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:42:02.100000,00:42:05.100000,,yeah I always do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:42:06.300000,00:42:11.800000,,I'd rather have decimal than fraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:42:12.300000,00:42:20.400000,mm-hmm thirty-five eight x graded slowly okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:42:20.600000,00:42:24.600000,,well I don't make it through this way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:42:21.800000,00:43:49.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,3,00:42:24.600000,00:42:39.400000,(inaudible) okay I'm guessing this is supposed to be an equal sign not just a line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,3,00:42:39.600000,00:42:43,,yeah that was looking better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,3,00:42:43.200000,00:42:44.300000,yummy yummy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,3,00:42:45.400000,00:42:46.400000,what,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,3,00:42:46.500000,00:42:52.900000,,this is a one twenty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:42:57.900000,00:43:06.800000,yeah that's supposed to be a one twenty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:42:59,00:43:03.400000,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:43:06.900000,00:43:09.900000,just like this is the first (inaudible)  okay yeah jeez (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:43:09.900000,00:43:17.200000,it doesn't actually matter which you subtract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:43:18.400000,00:43:22.800000,it's just which is more easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,5,00:43:23.500000,00:43:23.800000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:43:23.900000,00:43:35.300000,I mean I would prefer to have negative x than like negative one o three so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:43:35.300000,00:43:40.800000,,same I'm for a negative three equals a negative number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:43:41.200000,00:43:55.800000,and yeah think of it as negative one times x or a negative x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:43:49.900000,00:44:59.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:44:00.300000,00:44:08,and so then you divide both by negative one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:44:08.500000,00:44:13,and then we have negative one over,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:44:13.600000,00:44:16.100000,,negative one o three equals x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:44:16.300000,00:44:20.700000,I think yeah it should be right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
17,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:44:20.700000,00:44:37.300000,yeah I think that's right pause filler (sfx) scribbles everybody so hard to write,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
17,2,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:44:37.800000,00:45:01.500000,okay so it's like probably the most the hardest thing here is what you're writing comes out like just a slight delay like here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,2,00:44:59.600000,00:46:59.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:45:01.500000,00:45:07,,mm-hmm yeah that's the only thing it's about this (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:45:07.100000,00:45:08.400000,,the running is different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:45:08.500000,00:45:11.200000,I'm trying to do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:45:11.300000,00:45:17,pause filler so zero four carry the one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:45:17,00:45:23.100000,it's going to be yeah pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:45:23.100000,00:45:23.400000,that's yeah no (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,2,00:45:26.700000,00:45:28.800000,,that's true too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,2,00:45:30.900000,00:45:36.300000,wait no wait what am I doing,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,2,00:45:36.500000,00:45:42.100000,that's (inaudible) is two forty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,2,00:45:42.100000,00:45:43.300000,,uh-huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,2,00:45:43.500000,00:45:54.900000,okay okay let's just say I thought this was like a three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:45:55,00:46:00.700000,so then it would be three twenty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:00.800000,00:46:05,there's a three forty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:05.700000,00:46:09.700000,pause filler is it divisible by eleven,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:09.900000,00:46:14,,I don't think so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:15.800000,00:46:17.400000,,it would be (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:17.500000,00:46:20,,yeah I don't think it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:20,00:46:25.700000,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:20.600000,00:46:25.900000,there is an easy way to figure it out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:25.900000,00:46:32.100000,pause filler (inaudible) okay okay so we have twenty-seven minus six x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:32.200000,00:46:36,where the six go (laughter) figure out yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:36.100000,00:46:43.200000,(inaudible) oh my god so d now plus thirteen x this is a twenty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:43.400000,00:46:47.100000,yeah this is a twenty-seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:46:47.100000,00:46:48.400000,,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,2,00:46:48.400000,00:47:00.500000,oh my gosh and we have six x plus thirty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,10,2.0,2,00:47:00.800000,00:47:10.200000,okay thirty-six x I'm going to say this is a thirty-six,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:47:05,00:48:11.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:47:10.300000,00:47:12,you can't say this is not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:47:12.100000,00:47:20.500000,okay pause fillers then you have seven over thirty-six which is not a pretty number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,11,1.0,4,00:47:20.700000,00:47:30.600000,,no it isn't (inaudible) x okay plus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,11,1.0,4,00:47:31.600000,00:47:40.300000,so we have seventy-three times x plus thirty-eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,11,1.0,4,00:47:41.100000,00:47:50.900000,and so here we can multiply seventy-three to x and thirty-eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:47:52.700000,00:48:04.900000,so we have seventy-three x plus whatever seventy-three times thirty-eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,11,1.0,2,00:48:05.100000,00:48:12.800000,is this is what happens (inaudible) for,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:48:11.300000,00:51:25.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:48:12.800000,00:48:14.700000,pause filler that's twenty-four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:48:15,00:48:20.700000,that's fifty-six fifty-seven fifty-eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:48:20.700000,00:48:22.700000,that's seven yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:48:22.800000,00:48:24.900000,that's seventy-three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,4,00:48:27.600000,00:48:29.200000,so that's nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,4,00:48:29.400000,00:48:31.100000,and that's twenty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,4,00:48:31.200000,00:48:35.200000,so we have four seven five two pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,4,00:48:35.400000,00:48:41.200000,,two times by a hundred seventy-four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,4,00:48:41.800000,00:48:49.100000,yeah and this equals negative two guys (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:48:49.200000,00:49:00.500000,pause filler and then so yeah seventy-three x equals two thousand five hundred and seventy-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:49:00.700000,00:49:08.500000,,seventy-two so this (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:49:09.700000,00:49:11.600000,now are (inaudible) (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:49:11.800000,00:49:15.500000,,two plus five is seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:49:15.700000,00:49:22.100000,,seven seven is fourteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,6,00:49:22.900000,00:49:26.400000,I'm going to try,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,6,00:49:26.500000,00:49:34.800000,I actually really hope neither did this well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,6,00:49:36.500000,00:49:46,because that would be cool but this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,6,00:49:46.100000,00:49:48,,so this is not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,3,00:49:50.300000,00:50:06.700000,pause filler let's try three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,3,00:50:07.100000,00:50:25.800000,so two hundred ninety that's a one thirty-eight three eight two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,4,00:50:25.900000,00:50:30,pause filler that was actually very close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,4,00:50:30.600000,00:50:39.600000,pause filler so yeah that was very close to being divisible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,4,00:50:39.800000,00:50:51.800000,let's see if it was three hundred and sixty-five it would be divisible (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:50:52,00:50:58.900000,lawn division is great okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:50:59,00:51:21.300000,why am I getting the hard ones now (laughter),,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,12,1.0,2,00:51:21.400000,00:51:24.700000,oh yeah it used to be easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:51:25.300000,00:53:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,4,00:51:25.700000,00:51:28.700000,mental math is great see fifteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,4,00:51:29,00:51:33,so that's minus fifteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,4,00:51:33.100000,00:51:38.200000,and that's nine plus fifteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,4,00:51:38.200000,00:51:38.300000,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,4,00:51:38.300000,00:51:46.600000,pause filler we have seventy-three equals one twenty-nine minus sixteen plus (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,4,00:51:46.700000,00:51:55.800000,it's side and then one twenty-nine minus seventy-three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,2,00:51:56,00:51:59.600000,and we have six three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,2,00:51:59.700000,00:52:02.200000,that's five fifty six,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,2,00:52:02.400000,00:52:15.500000,pause filler now the question pause filler so I have x equals fifty-six over sixteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,2,00:52:15.700000,00:52:20.500000,we can simplify that to fourteen over four yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,2,00:52:20.600000,00:52:24.100000,and then that equals seven over two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:52:24.300000,00:52:29.300000,so it was close to a whole number but not really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:52:29.400000,00:52:30,,(inaudible) to those,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:52:30,00:52:33.200000,oh okay let's do two ninety-five and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:52:33.300000,00:52:41.500000,,one is two fifteen minus one seventy-seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:52:41.600000,00:52:43.700000,that is not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:52:43.800000,00:52:47,it's just two fifteen plus eighty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:52:47.100000,00:52:48.400000,so that's two ninety-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:52:48.500000,00:52:56,basically you want to simplify everything you can these are like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:52:56.100000,00:52:58.400000,so you can just add those two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:52:58.600000,00:53:03.100000,then it makes work a lot easier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:53:03.200000,00:53:03.300000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,13,0.0,1,00:53:03.500000,00:53:07,you could go two eighty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,4,00:53:06.100000,00:56:47.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:07.400000,00:53:10.900000,let's try it okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:10.900000,00:53:15.500000,okay if I just turn off lines moving it might be better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:15.600000,00:53:22.400000,pause filler so one seventy-seven is visible by three somehow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:22.400000,00:53:25.600000,I don't exactly get how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:25.700000,00:53:28.400000,pause filler so you have fifty-three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:28.500000,00:53:30.600000,and then we have twenty-seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:31.100000,00:53:36.300000,so it's nine time three so fifty-nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:36.700000,00:53:41,but two eighty-three is not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:41.200000,00:53:43.800000,no I'm just moving it like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:44.200000,00:53:48.400000,you don't want to (inaudible) pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,1,00:53:49.700000,00:53:55.400000,,these are really hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,3,00:53:58.200000,00:54:03.600000,at least it's not factoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,3,00:54:04,00:54:09.800000,that's like all I have to say (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,4,00:54:11.500000,00:54:38.200000,pause filler yes forty-five x plus thirty equals twenty-eight plus thirty-three times twenty-six ninety-six plus sixty-four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,3,00:54:40.800000,00:55:14.600000,and we have negative eleven equals pause filler seventy-two ninety-two plus ninety-six minus forty-five so ninety-one fifty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,3,00:55:18.900000,00:55:25.100000,and then we subtract ninety-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,3,00:55:19,00:55:20,,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,0,00:55:25.600000,00:55:26,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,0,00:55:32.200000,00:55:32.500000,,good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,5,00:56:03.400000,00:56:09.700000,all right I didn't actually finish this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,2,T2 ,14,1.0,5,00:56:12.300000,00:56:15.300000,yeah (inaudible) matters I can just take this and (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:00:36.500000,00:00:48,,I'm turning to eighth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:00:48.800000,00:00:58.600000,oh same with me pause filler are you taking any languages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:01:00.400000,00:01:01.800000,,pause filler yes German,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,4,00:01:03.500000,00:01:38.300000,pause filler I was thinking about taking that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,4,00:01:39.200000,00:02:01,but I'm taking Latin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,2,00:02:04.500000,00:02:08.400000,,and now (inaudible) stylus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,2,00:02:10,00:02:22.300000,yeah oh forwards I'm heavy but backwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,1,00:02:22.900000,00:03:26.600000,I'm not what am I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,S1 ,,,0,00:03:49.500000,00:03:52.700000,no let me know if you want the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,3,00:03:52.700000,00:04:22.700000,,I don't know the answer (inaudible) with riddles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,0,00:03:53,00:03:58,(laughter) (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,1,00:04:22.700000,00:04:36.300000,do you want to know the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,1,00:04:36.800000,00:04:37.100000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,1,00:04:37.800000,00:04:43.600000,ton forwards I'm heavy but backwards I'm not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,1,00:04:44.900000,00:04:45.100000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,1,00:04:45.200000,00:04:50.800000,,it's like games we play,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,1,00:04:51,00:05:00,,like you'd asked everybody that riddle (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,2,00:05:00.300000,00:05:06.100000,yeah it's so silly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,2,00:05:06.200000,00:05:08.500000,,because it literally gives you the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,2,00:05:08.800000,00:05:13.900000,,yes it is like you most simply get complicated (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,2,00:05:13.900000,00:05:20.400000,like most people would get through the point of reversing the styling of the word,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,2,00:05:21.600000,00:05:27,but then they'll think things like that's where it spells or not isn't a good example,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,S1 ,,,2,00:05:28.600000,00:05:33,but like one way they're thinking like one way to have the object the other way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,2,00:05:33,00:05:34.900000,it's a lightweight object,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,1,00:05:34.900000,00:05:36.900000,,naturally the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,S1 ,,,6,00:06:49,00:06:49.900000,can you still hear me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:09:30.600000,00:09:33.400000,yeah what's up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:09:33.900000,00:09:38.800000,pause filler I'm guessing you know pretty much how basic equations like this work,,,,,,,,,,MCRP,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS

18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:09:40,00:09:40.200000,,(inaudible) of this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:09:40.200000,00:09:45.500000,,and I don't know what is happening pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:09:47.100000,00:10:00,and then of course if you have a them as then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:00,00:10:07.100000,you're just doing it in the exact opposite order you would,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:07.300000,00:10:11,addition and subtraction are technically the same thing,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:11,00:10:12.600000,because subtracting you're just adding a negative,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:12.600000,00:10:14.400000,but let's say you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:14.400000,00:10:15.900000,in this case you have minus six,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:15.900000,00:10:18.800000,so you would add it with six,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:18.800000,00:10:20.500000,so you're doing it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:20.500000,00:10:25.900000,except with the inverse all the things and in the opposite order and then like if I have different,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:25.900000,00:10:34.600000,addition and subtraction are technically the same thing same with multiplication and division dividing it and multiplying by fraction and then oh yeah,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:35.200000,00:10:49.100000,so you know if you have like five y plus four equals twenty-four,,ODQ,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:49.900000,00:10:53,I know I have a terrible handwriting but anything like a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:53.700000,00:10:55.700000,you work for this backwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:10:55.900000,00:11:04.900000,and you have the inverse operations pause filler same with exponents with the logarithms,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:04.900000,00:11:07.100000,I'm not quite sure how that works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:07.100000,00:11:10.600000,so I can't find that here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:11.800000,00:11:20.200000,and then find just exactly what you think even if you have two x plus,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:21.700000,00:11:34.100000,I'll put pause filler four okay plus three x equals x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:34.800000,00:11:38.600000,you can't take care best until you've taken care of best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:38.900000,00:11:40.400000,so do you know what you do in this situation,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:40.400000,00:11:41.300000,why don't you rewrite it,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:43.700000,00:11:49.400000,I probably actually I can probably play,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:53.300000,00:11:53.800000,so if you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:11:53.800000,00:12:10.600000,I know you can probably write better but two x plus four in parenthesis plus three x equals x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,LPA,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:10.800000,00:12:12.700000,do you know what you do in this situation,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:13.400000,00:12:18,,you do the parenthesis last,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:18.600000,00:12:23.700000,so yes you have to do the parenthesis last to write your,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:25.600000,00:12:28.900000,I mean there are technically two ways of answering this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:29.200000,00:12:31.900000,but one is a lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:12:31.900000,00:12:34.300000,you feel (inaudible) plus four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:12:34.500000,00:12:43.200000,you could technically divide by five for what you'd be doing if you have y plus four fifth,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:12:44.100000,00:12:48.900000,because what you're doing is you're multiplying all this entire side by one fifth,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:12:49.200000,00:12:54.200000,and then you'd have twenty-four over five whatever the heck that is,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:12:54.400000,00:12:58.200000,and it's a lot easier if you just subtract four first into your,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:12:58.200000,00:13:00.600000,it's the same thing if,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:13:00.600000,00:13:04.400000,you could've technically multiply with his back here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:05,00:13:07.300000,but it's much easier to subtract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:08.400000,00:13:11.800000,so can you try to solve this one through,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:18.900000,00:13:19,,yeah (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:13:20.900000,00:13:31.900000,pause filler there's a same for the fifth bottom one easier (inaudible),,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:13:31.900000,00:13:38.500000,,you just click,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:13:38.900000,00:13:39.800000,what,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:13:39.800000,00:13:43.200000,,you need to write,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:14:05.800000,00:14:06,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:14:28.800000,00:14:29.200000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:14:29.800000,00:14:31.800000,pause filler are you writing or,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:14:31.800000,00:14:33.400000,,no I'm thinking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:14:33.400000,00:14:54.800000,okay I just wanted to make sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:14:58.700000,00:15:07.500000,so you know how subtracting coefficient works like x minus three x,,AC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:15:07.500000,00:15:11.700000,because you need to deal with this term first no,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:15:18,00:15:27.400000,,maybe I'm sorry my writing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDA/IDQ,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:15:27.800000,00:15:33.300000,,it's just not working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:15:40.200000,00:15:49,so let me know if you don't know any of these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:15:49,00:15:58.200000,and if the problem you'll need subtracting coefficients pause filler negative if numbers and then simple,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:15:59.900000,00:16:04.700000,pause filler division I believe simple that and problem solving,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:16:04.700000,00:16:15.600000,we're subtracting sides that being don't,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:16:15.800000,00:16:36.100000,so if you don't know how to do it that's perfectly fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:16:37.500000,00:16:40.900000,,yeah yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:16:43.400000,00:16:53.300000,okay so I'm going to like some let me this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:16:54.100000,00:16:57.800000,start with the simpler problems that are basically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:16:57.800000,00:16:59.100000,show the pieces of this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:16:59.900000,00:17:07.300000,,on that problem you were saying like four over five something like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:17:07.300000,00:17:08.900000,,where is the five coming from,,AE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:17:09.400000,00:17:10.300000,in this one,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:17:12,00:17:14.100000,,pause filler no the ones that were down here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:17:14.800000,00:17:19.900000,okay yeah sorry I was talking about this one not that one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDA
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:17:21,00:17:21.700000,,oh okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:17:22.300000,00:17:26,that one if this one you could divide it by five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:17:26.700000,00:17:29.500000,it's a lot simpler if you just subtract four first,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:17:30,00:17:36,because you end up with y plus four over five is equals twenty-four over five,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:17:36.100000,00:17:41.900000,which I don't want to go for that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:17:43.400000,00:17:49.200000,okay pause filler the same basic so let me see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:17:49.200000,00:17:58.100000,you just know how to solve this two sides okay of an equation with variables on two sides like this,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:17:58.700000,00:17:59,,I don't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:18:01.400000,00:18:14.500000,,I have done the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:18:14.600000,00:18:18.900000,,I just can't remember,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:18:19.200000,00:18:27.700000,okay then what you do with pause filler you could subtract either x or sort of react in something like this,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:18:27.800000,00:18:29,it doesn't really matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:18:29,00:18:32.300000,it's easier to do with the pause filler smaller one,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,1,00:18:32.300000,00:18:34.400000,because it keeps the coefficient positive,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:18:35.300000,00:18:36,so I'd say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:18:36,00:18:38.900000,I would subtract x from both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:18:39.400000,00:18:43.600000,we'd end up with two x equals zero,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:18:43.800000,00:18:46.900000,now this becomes a solvable problem right quite simple,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:18:49,00:18:58.900000,,what do you mean x besides that like yeah,,AE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:19:00.900000,00:19:01,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:19:01.500000,00:19:06.200000,,I want to say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:19:06.800000,00:19:16.400000,so then do you know basic negative numbers like how to get four minus seven,,AC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:19:18.600000,00:19:20.800000,,oops sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDA,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:19:20.800000,00:19:21.700000,pause filler for minus seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:19:23.500000,00:19:33.700000,,yeah that'll be minus three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:34.900000,00:19:47.600000,yup so then we can have a problem like x plus seven equals four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:48.200000,00:19:50.600000,and we got to subtract,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:51,00:19:55.300000,so you already know that we subtract first that negative for like,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:55.300000,00:19:57.200000,and then if we were to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:57.200000,00:19:57.800000,we can make this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:19:58.100000,00:20:00.800000,do you know like decimals slash fractions,,AC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,3,00:20:00.800000,00:20:03.200000,where I would have two x plus seven equals four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:05.700000,00:20:11.700000,,how are they related,,AE,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:12.400000,00:20:14.400000,so it's two times x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:15.100000,00:20:15.800000,that's what it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:15.800000,00:20:18.900000,if you don't have anything between a number and a variable,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:18.900000,00:20:20.800000,it means they're being multiplied plus x,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:20:20.800000,00:20:21.900000,I mean equals four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:24:41.700000,00:24:45.700000,,is that right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:24:46.800000,00:24:53.800000,no so do you not know what to do when you have a coefficient on the variable equal something,,CU,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:24:55.700000,00:25:01.400000,so here we have two times x equals negative three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,2,00:25:01.900000,00:25:03,so what we would do is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:25:03.200000,00:25:05.100000,we divide both sides by two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:25:06.900000,00:25:08,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:25:08.400000,00:25:13.200000,so it's not negative six but negative one point five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,0,00:25:14.800000,00:25:31.300000,have three and negative three divided by two is equal to two negative one point five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:25:31.300000,00:25:40.500000,so okay so actually with that do you know how (inaudible) like,,AC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T1 ,1,0.0,4,00:25:40.500000,00:25:59.800000,if you have two x two times a quantity x plus one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:36:55.600000,00:37:14.400000,pause filler on the back of anything that (inaudible) we got to make sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:20.700000,00:37:23.900000,so if we were to subtract eighteen from both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:25.500000,00:37:26.700000,that's what we do first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,1,1.0,1,00:37:30,00:37:38.500000,we got the opposite of y equals five right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,1,1.0,1,00:37:38.900000,00:37:40.700000,,you're almost right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,T2 ,1,1.0,1,00:37:49.100000,00:37:49.600000,,I guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
18,1,T2 ,1,1.0,1,00:37:49.600000,00:37:51.400000,so we multiply by negative one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,1,1.0,1,00:37:54.300000,00:37:57.400000,and we got y equals negative five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,1,1.0,1,00:37:57.400000,00:38:00.400000,which is I have here you know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:38:23.800000,00:38:26.400000,,I feel like (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:38:26.700000,00:38:33.200000,oh okay pause filler (inaudible) pause filler interesting so I believe the packet have a purpose of the variable first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:38:33.200000,00:38:34.100000,I don't need to do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:38:34.100000,00:38:34.900000,I thought I will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:38:37,00:38:40,pause filler there are multiple ways to do this because math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:38:40,00:38:41.800000,it's a free country,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:38:44.800000,00:38:52,the packet might do it in different ways but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:38:52.100000,00:38:56.600000,pause filler so like that ignore best I subtract k from both sides,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:38:56.600000,00:39:02,negative two k minus fourteen equals thirty-six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:39:04,00:39:11.200000,add eighteen plus five negative two k equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:39:15.800000,00:39:16.700000,what,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:39:16.700000,00:39:21.100000,,I'm not sure it's actually on the packet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:39:21.100000,00:39:27.200000,oh yeah pause filler I think they should step to make sure that everything was right beforehand okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:39:28.500000,00:39:31.600000,,yeah on the packet there was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:39:31.700000,00:39:37.100000,the cake would be equal to negative twenty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:39:39.200000,00:39:42.400000,this should be right twenty-five minus fourteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:39:43.500000,00:39:55.600000,it's a eleven thirty-six plus or negative twenty-five (inaudible) or but then (inaudible) well definitely it sorry,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDA
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:39:56.100000,00:40:06.800000,this side totally breaks out to eleven thirty-six plus twenty so thirty-six minus twenty-five if the value wake out to eleven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:40:06.800000,00:40:09.700000,if we tell the stack again yeah eleven equals eleven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:40:10.800000,00:40:22.100000,so this is right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:40:33.600000,00:41:04.900000,pause filler so I can subtract k from both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:41:04.900000,00:41:05.800000,,(inaudible) okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:41:07.600000,00:42:29.500000,I just cracked it from both sides but then that negative k minus k negative two k so maybe two k minus fourteen thirty-six negative two k so that's what (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:41:53.300000,00:47:37.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:31.100000,00:42:36,thirty-six so make them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:36.100000,00:42:38.600000,,I know twenty-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:38.600000,00:42:41.100000,,I know like this an arrow by needle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:41.600000,00:42:44.200000,so you're adding k to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:44.400000,00:42:45.800000,if that should still be right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:46.300000,00:42:48.100000,negative fourteen equals thirty-six plus two k,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:48.100000,00:42:51.400000,,and then subtracting thirty-six from both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:51,00:42:51.600000,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:51.600000,00:42:54.900000,okay subtracting thirty-six that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:54.900000,00:42:57.100000,,thirty-six are not negative twenty-two,,,,CA,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:42:57.500000,00:43:02.400000,that this is negative fourteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:43:02.800000,00:43:03.200000,,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,5,00:43:03.500000,00:43:08.900000,pause filler minus thirty-six is negative fifty divided by two to negative twenty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,5,00:43:09.700000,00:43:20,,okay that makes sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,5,00:43:20.900000,00:43:34.200000,so yeah I don't know if eight is terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:43:34.200000,00:43:38.200000,I can okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:43:38.800000,00:43:40.100000,pause filler I can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:43:41.300000,00:43:44,let's say if I would subtract p from both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDS
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:43:45.600000,00:43:56.300000,I get seventeen minus two b equals thirteen minus thirty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:43:57.500000,00:44:04.500000,actually let's subtract seventeen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:44:05.600000,00:44:12.400000,that would make more sense negative two oh (inaudible) pause filler negative two yeah,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:44:12.800000,00:44:22.900000,negative two b equals negative four divided by negative two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:44:22.900000,00:44:26.300000,yup b equals two,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:44:28.100000,00:44:36.500000,,it proves like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:44:38.100000,00:45:06.800000,,where did you get rid of things given you,AE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:45:06.800000,00:45:14,pause filler so in the first step I subtracted b from this side,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:45:14,00:45:14.500000,so this is a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:45:14.500000,00:45:16.600000,I'm trying to write it down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:45:16.600000,00:45:19.100000,this next part is seventeen minus two b,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:45:19.700000,00:45:22.100000,,oh oh okay okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:45:22.100000,00:46:02.800000,thirteen then we subtracted seventeen to both sides yeah (inaudible) that out in that negative two b equals negative four b equals five divided five by negative two equals two yeah five partial (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:46:03.900000,00:46:04.100000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,2,00:46:07.200000,00:46:09.100000,divide both sides by negative nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,2,00:46:11.300000,00:46:14.400000,g equals negative nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,2,00:46:14.600000,00:46:31.600000,subtract ten from both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,2,00:46:33.200000,00:46:42.400000,seventy-two equals negative eight y or divided by five by negative eight,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,2,00:46:47.200000,00:46:50.300000,and divide negative equal two like,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,1,00:46:51,00:47:20.500000,but that's an equal sign negative nine so (inaudible) here,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,1,00:47:20.900000,00:47:29.800000,I don't know why that (inaudible) like that's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:30.100000,00:47:40.200000,add sixty-five to both sides twenty-six oh (inaudible) twenty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:40.200000,00:47:41.100000,I'm sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDA
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:41.100000,00:47:47.800000,subtract sixty-five minus sixty-five minus,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:48.300000,00:47:59.300000,pause filler that would be one hundred to my sixty one hundred minus fifty-eight ninety-two minus,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:47:53.600000,00:50:45.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:48:02.600000,00:48:07.200000,that would be forty-eight equals negative fourteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:48:07.200000,00:48:16.500000,pause filler that doesn't quite (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:48:16.800000,00:48:23.900000,pause filler so four divide both sides by negative fourteen (inaudible) equals two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:48:24.200000,00:48:27.900000,let me work this out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:48:28.800000,00:48:40.400000,forty-eight okay equals twenty-four over seven twenty-four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:48:41.100000,00:48:44.900000,that's it as far as I can do with it negative,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:48:45.100000,00:48:58.600000,but I like to rate it as a next number three negative three and three yeah three times negative three and thirty-seven,,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:48:59.200000,00:49:02.300000,,can I tell you something,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:49:02.400000,00:49:03.300000,what,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:49:03.300000,00:49:05.100000,,you are a half genius (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,LPA,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:49:05.100000,00:49:05.300000,I know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:49:05.700000,00:49:21.300000,add forty-one to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:49:21.600000,00:49:28.300000,seventy-five equals nine end up really,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:49:28.300000,00:49:32.200000,the thing is when you actually are able to understand the operations you're doing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,1,00:49:32.200000,00:49:35,you realize there are so many different ways things can be done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,1,00:49:35.600000,00:49:44.200000,tell me when you divide both sides by negative nine right now (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,1,00:49:45.800000,00:49:50.500000,pause filler nine times eight is seventy-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,1,00:49:50.800000,00:50:00.600000,so k equal to eight and three-ninths which are due to one or,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:50:02.100000,00:50:19.500000,pause filler did I yeah oh that would be negative negative eight and one third,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:50:20.600000,00:50:21.100000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:50:21.600000,00:50:30.400000,pause filler hi add p to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:50:31.900000,00:50:41.300000,fifty-two equals nine p minus everything,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:50:41.300000,00:50:48,I like my number because these numbers are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,5,1.0,0,00:50:45.400000,00:51:14.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,5,1.0,4,00:50:48,00:50:50.400000,yeah add fifty-two to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,1,T2 ,5,1.0,0,00:51:11.200000,00:51:11.400000,bye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,1,T2 ,9,0.0,Na,00:55:24.600000,00:56:03.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:01:09.400000,00:07:51.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:01:20.500000,00:01:22.800000,,so let's hear your least favorite color,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:01:22.800000,00:01:31.100000,pause filler least favorite color I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:01:33.500000,00:01:39.200000,,at least mine is like a bright bright bright bright green like greenish with like a lot of white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:01:39.200000,00:01:44.600000,,but it just looks kind of like I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:01:44.600000,00:02:21.200000,,it's just like it feels like the kind of thing that (inaudible) with anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:02:21.300000,00:02:24.900000,(inaudible) and for my final project I'm trying to code something really weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,Na,00:02:25.600000,00:02:33.600000,it's a variant of chess where spectators decide how to be (inaudible) but don't tell the players how they move,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:02:33.600000,00:02:42.500000,,so it's like chess except the players need to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:02:42.500000,00:02:44.100000,,the players only sometimes get to move,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:02:44.700000,00:02:46.800000,yeah the players need to figure out how to move,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:02:48,00:02:52.400000,pause filler in some variant players get to keep trying and want to make a move and others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:02:52.400000,00:02:56.100000,if they're making a link the one that goes to the max players (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:02:56.100000,00:03:01.600000,,oh okay so the spectators they just choose how the pieces move,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:03:02,00:03:02.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:03:03.300000,00:03:06.100000,,oh that will be fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:03:06.100000,00:03:08.600000,yeah I found it on Wikipedia it's called Penultima,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,3,00:03:08.600000,00:03:15.800000,,it's like next-level chess or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,3,00:03:16.200000,00:03:30,yeah I'm probably going to have it be played in two different ways one where you input the pause filler how the pieces move and then the computer to find different moves (inaudible) and then one where (inaudible) the spectators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,3,00:03:30.500000,00:03:34.900000,because in the first one the moves are more restrictive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:03:34.900000,00:03:39.300000,but there will be no mistakes or cheating to the spectators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:03:40,00:03:43,in the second one you have that human element,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:03:43.300000,00:03:46.100000,but it doesn't allow for more creative rules,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:03:46.400000,00:03:54,,yeah well I mean like maybe only having one spectator because,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:03:54.100000,00:03:58.700000,,and like there could be other spectators but only one that decides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:03:59.600000,00:04:05,,because you know if you know that one because,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:04:05.100000,00:04:05.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:05.500000,00:04:10.500000,,like if (inaudible) with one person you know makes it really a part base field to move,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:10.500000,00:04:14.100000,,the other person will also have that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:14.300000,00:04:14.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:14.600000,00:04:15,,so yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:16.600000,00:04:22.600000,so generally if I have multiple spectators before the game begins when I talk about how the pieces will be moving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:22.900000,00:04:28.700000,,yeah well yeah that's just neat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,2,00:04:29.300000,00:04:36.900000,yeah the thing that where the computer are (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:04:37.200000,00:04:45,the thing that actually makes up possible to code is the fact that you can't have the rules be too complicated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:04:45.100000,00:04:47.400000,because then the players will never figure them out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:04:47.500000,00:05:00.500000,,well I mean something else you could run into is the computer having a new set of rules for each of move,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:00.500000,00:05:02.300000,yeah pause filler I haven't done Macs yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:02.300000,00:05:07.100000,I haven't even coding it maybe about an hour but pause filler right now I have had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:07.700000,00:05:09.400000,I'm not rendering (inaudible) anything yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:09.400000,00:05:15.500000,but I have a to-do list so a list of lists where it's eight by eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:15.500000,00:05:22.800000,and then it just have letters for the pieces pause filler lower case all for the black row and upper case long for the white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:23,00:05:27.100000,then it has the two letter of four light and king,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:27.700000,00:05:30.100000,,so you couldn't make it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:30.300000,00:05:33.800000,,so there's like only a certain amount of pieces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:05:33.900000,00:05:37.300000,,the moves can be changed to make it so like not like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:05:37.300000,00:05:43.600000,,because if it was different you would need to figure it out and remember it for each piece,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:05:45.600000,00:05:46.900000,,I mean we're having a list though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:05:47.500000,00:05:50.200000,yeah like the rook couldn't move in one way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:05:50.200000,00:05:52,the (inaudible) sort of move in a different way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:05:53.100000,00:06:01.600000,but like sometimes they can change when they're being captured or capturing the piece like how a pawn moves diagonally if it's capturing a piece then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:06:02,00:06:11.800000,pause filler also there's also something weird in Penultima called invoking of piece where a piece can affect another piece on the board without actually moving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:06:13.700000,00:06:20.600000,so it's kind of so it makes so even if the piece itself is weak it increases its strategic importance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:06:20.900000,00:06:27.300000,kind of like how the king is arguably the weakest piece in the game and yet also the most important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:06:28.100000,00:06:30,,well actually I have found it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
18,2,S1 ,,,5,00:06:30,00:06:38.400000,,if like the person doesn't have many pieces that are very good at capturing king the king can like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:38.400000,00:06:41.400000,,because the king can't die,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:41.400000,00:06:45.500000,,so it's like if you only have really pawns left you know maybe a bishop or two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:45.700000,00:06:47.500000,,like the king can't just go up and kill them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:47.500000,00:06:49.300000,,because the king can't die,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:49.300000,00:06:55.500000,that's because by the rules the game you're not allowed to put the position in the king into a position where he could,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:56.300000,00:07:00.400000,,yeah so that kind of means that (inaudible) (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,4,00:07:02.100000,00:07:06.200000,but like the car is definitively more powerful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,1,00:07:06.200000,00:07:09.100000,because it can move to every place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,1,00:07:09.100000,00:07:10.300000,it freaking can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,1,00:07:10.400000,00:07:15.200000,it can move (inaudible) where it can be killed and if it is killed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,1,00:07:15.200000,00:07:20.500000,,because you know like regardless of the king,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,1,00:07:20.800000,00:07:24,,the king can't technically die unless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,1,00:07:24,00:07:29.800000,,and if it does then the game is lost so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,1,00:07:29.800000,00:07:31.900000,yeah checkmate if you (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,1,00:07:31.900000,00:07:35.400000,,but that's very difficult (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:07:35.400000,00:07:41.200000,,so when like because like I think rooks are one of the best pieces for doing checkmate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:07:41.700000,00:07:45.200000,yeah that and knights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:07:45.400000,00:07:49.800000,,yeah so it's like they,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,6,00:07:50.400000,00:07:51.300000,,time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,0,00:08:14.800000,00:08:20,,pause filler do you see the problems wherever seven actually goes forty,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,0,00:08:20,00:08:20,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S1 ,,,0,00:08:20.100000,00:08:20.800000,,okay he does,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:09:31.400000,00:10:20.300000,okay pause filler can you solve this problem here or at least the (inaudible),,,,HO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:10:20.300000,00:10:23,,I realize now the (inaudible) people work at the back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:10:29.300000,00:10:30.700000,yes that would make fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:10:30.700000,00:10:31.200000,,is that right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:10:32.300000,00:10:34.300000,pause filler no I don't believe so,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:10:34.300000,00:10:34.300000,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:10:36.600000,00:10:37,,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:10:37,00:10:45.500000,pause filler so pause filler do you remember what to do when you have pause filler multiplication on the variable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:10:51.100000,00:10:51.800000,,multiplication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:10:52.500000,00:10:55.200000,so this is three sevenths times x,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:10:55.200000,00:10:59.300000,,oh oh times oh yeah okay wait divide,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:11:02.800000,00:11:22.300000,,should I need to add x to both sides divide it,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:11:22.300000,00:11:25.100000,pause filler so you want to isolate x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:11:25.100000,00:11:25.700000,I'm sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:11:25.900000,00:11:28.300000,I accidentally move that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:11:28.300000,00:11:31.600000,,okay okay so subtract three sevenths,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:11:31.700000,00:11:33.100000,you would not subtract,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:11:33.100000,00:11:35.800000,because subtraction is the inverse of addition,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:11:36.200000,00:11:38.800000,what you want to do here is sense this is multiplication,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:11:38.800000,00:11:41,and you want to do the inverse of multiplication then,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:11:41,00:12:48.300000,,okay division pause filler division remember I'm not sure how to do this,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:12:56.300000,00:13:03.500000,,like I'm going to make some fraction between five and six,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:13:05.500000,00:13:10,so you get that we need to pause filler use division here right,,CU,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:13:10.400000,00:13:15,,yeah dividing three sevenths to both sides so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:13:15.100000,00:13:18.300000,so do you know how to divide with fractions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:13:18.700000,00:13:26.300000,,I thought it was just like normal division,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:13:27.400000,00:13:29.200000,not exactly,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:13:30.800000,00:13:33.400000,,remembering it like multiplication,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:13:33.600000,00:13:37,I mean normal division could be done like this,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:13:37.100000,00:13:41.900000,but what you do is you multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:13:42,00:14:00.700000,,oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yes I guess yes okay so forty (inaudible) divisible by three is it,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:14:00.700000,00:14:01.900000,,no it's not,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:14:03.700000,00:14:04.100000,what,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,4,00:14:05.100000,00:14:08.300000,so pause filler I actually don't believe this would be divisible by three one thing,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:14:08.300000,00:14:09.900000,pause filler that is five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:14:10.100000,00:14:14.200000,,I think it's divisible by anything just as a fraction,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:14:14.400000,00:14:26.900000,pause filler if five time two to the power of three times seven so now there's no (inaudible) units pause filler (inaudible) occasion between,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:14:27,00:14:28.200000,that's not divisible by three,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:14:36.400000,00:14:38.700000,so I yeah it looks like it's fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,2,00:14:38.700000,00:14:41.900000,if you just write it up all fraction so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,2,00:14:42.600000,00:14:48.600000,pause filler do you know how to multiply a fraction by a whole number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,2,00:14:49.700000,00:14:52.800000,,pause filler yes multiply it straight across,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,2,00:14:53.400000,00:14:59.600000,yeah because basically forty is the same as forty divided by one,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:15:01.800000,00:15:11.200000,,yeah okay oh please don't tell me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,2,00:15:05,00:15:06,okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:18:44.900000,00:18:47.500000,,like it's seven or three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,1,1.0,1,00:18:50.800000,00:18:53.300000,okay so this is basically the same problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:20:01,00:21:19.900000,the difficult won't be this level by three only (inaudible) seven power oh (inaudible) would be seven and two four so (inaudible) but it will be divisible by or seven,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:04.900000,00:23:11.400000,okay so pause filler again this here is multiplication,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:12.300000,00:23:16.700000,but because of we basically go into,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ

18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,4,00:23:43.800000,00:23:44.700000,,so okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,4,00:24:41.700000,00:24:47.900000,okay so now we simplify this down to an equation in a (inaudible) forward so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,4,00:24:47.900000,00:24:55.800000,,yeah oh so negative this time though,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,4,00:24:56.200000,00:25:10.300000,yeah so the only difference is that a positive times a negative is negative,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:25:20.100000,00:25:48.700000,,okay so this will probably be a negative number,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:25:48.800000,00:25:48.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:26:16.300000,00:26:24.600000,okay and pause filler I don't know if it wants you to simplify it that or not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:26:24.600000,00:26:26.600000,but you easily could right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:26:29.600000,00:26:38.900000,the stock I'll make this equal sign write the simplify (inaudible),,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,4,00:26:45.100000,00:26:51.300000,,yeah so you actually don't need that over one at all,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,4,00:26:51.300000,00:26:57.900000,,because now we have a one divided by one equals x so,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:26:58.800000,00:27:16.700000,so y is driven (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:27:18.800000,00:27:27.400000,,negative thought yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:27:27.400000,00:27:35.900000,okay pause filler okay (inaudible) I think the (inaudible) for both could be fourth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:27:38,00:27:38.800000,,because (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:29:16,00:29:18.300000,yeah in fact he didn't write this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:29:18.300000,00:29:19.500000,it just appeared this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:29:20.500000,00:29:21.900000,unnecessary (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:29:27,00:29:27.600000,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:29:27.600000,00:29:29.300000,I think he didn't write it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:29:29.300000,00:29:32.100000,,and just after a little bit of I did it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,2,00:29:32.100000,00:29:35.100000,,I crossed undo and it disappeared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:29:49.300000,00:29:49.700000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:30:01.100000,00:30:03.500000,yeah we were on it for a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:30:03.700000,00:30:04.800000,and then it disappeared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:30:09.800000,00:30:10.700000,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:30:11,00:30:13.300000,we hadn't written anything on (inaudible) forty-four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:30:18.700000,00:30:19.600000,pause filler okay are we good (inaudible),,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,4,00:30:35.200000,00:30:35.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,0,00:31:26.400000,00:31:37.900000,,see that's interesting not just I think that the king can be very very powerful if you're careful about when and then where you use them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,0,00:31:38.800000,00:31:38.900000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,Na,00:31:40.200000,00:31:43.700000,,because you know you charge them into middle piece,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,Na,00:31:43.700000,00:31:46.800000,,or you're going to get surrounded easily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,Na,00:31:48.100000,00:31:53.600000,,but you know there's just like some of them like around your area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,Na,00:31:53.700000,00:32:09.300000,,you can just go around and take them out because like a single like in a single community,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,Na,00:32:10.200000,00:32:16.300000,,like it's next to a community,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T1 ,4,0.0,Na,00:32:16.400000,00:32:18.600000,,like it's pathetic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,5,00:32:16.700000,00:37:14.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:32:18.700000,00:32:22.500000,,because you can't handle actually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:32:22.500000,00:32:25.100000,I mean the queen you moved anywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:32:25.100000,00:32:27.400000,or the king (inaudible) hits itself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:32:27.400000,00:32:29.800000,,no it could run out to the king,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:32:29.900000,00:32:31.700000,,the king will be in checkmate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:32:34.200000,00:32:34.500000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:32:34.900000,00:32:43.200000,,oh well I mean it's oblivion pause filler the king being able to kill the queen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:32:43.700000,00:32:49.500000,yeah the queen can be able to relatively would fell ever learned the king again and more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:32:51.200000,00:32:57.800000,,the thing that makes like the king important is that it's how you win the game and to lose the game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:32:58.300000,00:33:23,,I mean you know they're definitely (inaudible) the kings pause filler insensibility to your advantage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:33:23,00:33:24.700000,,because like the king is (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:33:24.800000,00:33:32.900000,,it can't be killed by a piece,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,Na,00:33:33,00:33:36.400000,well that's partially true for other pieces too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,3,00:33:36.700000,00:33:43.200000,because the part of the king is you're not allowed to move it to a place where it's (inaudible) the other pieces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,3,00:33:43.200000,00:33:46.200000,if you're being careful you could avoid moving it to a place where it's (inaudible) and pinned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,3,00:33:46.200000,00:33:49.500000,,yes but the king has very free movement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,3,00:33:49.500000,00:33:52,,and you know like the queen you want to keep safe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,3,00:33:52,00:33:53.500000,,because the queen is very powerful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,3,00:33:54,00:33:54.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,3,00:33:54.900000,00:34:03.800000,,like definitely more powerful than the king but I think the king is the second most powerful piece,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
18,2,S2 ,,,5,00:34:03.800000,00:34:12.900000,so are you saying that there are other pieces that have more free to movement because of their distance,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,5,00:34:13.400000,00:34:15.100000,or even the night you can jump over pieces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,5,00:34:17.900000,00:34:24.700000,but the point is those you end up being sacrifice all the king,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,5,00:34:25.200000,00:34:28,you're guarding it with every pieces you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,5,00:34:28,00:34:32.900000,so the king is not powerful but strategically important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,5,00:34:33.400000,00:34:38.500000,his power lies in is actually a weakness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:34:38.800000,00:34:41,it's how your opponent will attempt to win the game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:34:41,00:34:48.500000,,yeah but like how like any pieces are just like relatively close to you in your base,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:34:48.700000,00:34:50.400000,,you can stay involved easily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:34:51.300000,00:34:57.800000,,just like if you go close to them they will most likely move back to the base,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:34:58,00:35:05.900000,,because usually any pieces that get there either cannot go back or pause filler are like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,6,00:35:06.600000,00:35:11.100000,,because you know a piece that really make I get there upon which you know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,6,00:35:11.100000,00:35:17.700000,,that's the only piece that can't go backwards until pause filler it reaches the other side of work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,6,00:35:17.900000,00:35:24.200000,the thing is you can really use any piece to steer an opponent off as long as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,6,00:35:24.600000,00:35:29.500000,pause filler it's in a place where it can take your opponent's speed can't take it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,6,00:35:29.600000,00:35:32.900000,knights are amazing at this because of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,6,00:35:33,00:35:35.600000,they're both some of the weirdest patterns of movement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:35:35.600000,00:35:42.200000,and they can jump over on little pieces than rooks and bishops for any attacks are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:35:45.900000,00:35:49,pause filler and pawns threaten rooks and knights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:35:49,00:35:52.500000,but the pawns are also commonly used to protect knights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:35:57.500000,00:36:02.300000,,so this has ruin chess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:36:03.100000,00:36:06.100000,,but if your pawns are like sending off against each other in the middle of the board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:36:06.500000,00:36:08.400000,,I can't remember what's called,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:36:08.500000,00:36:13.300000,,but it's like you couldn't move the pawn the way it would normally move to attack,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:36:13.900000,00:36:20.800000,,it kills the pawn that is important to that though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:36:20.800000,00:36:23.900000,interesting in what variant is this,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:36:25.600000,00:36:29.500000,,not much us currently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:36:30.200000,00:36:32,I don't think that's correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:36:32,00:36:39.200000,because some of them are popular opening half two pieces standing off for the only time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:36:39.800000,00:36:49.800000,,I mean it's like one of those rules that people don't really know about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,5,00:37:28.700000,00:37:38.400000,so the thing is openings like this are even popular among like chess masters who has memorized books full of chess strategies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:37:40.100000,00:37:42.600000,,yeah like when I find installed me the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:37:42.700000,00:37:54.400000,,like it might just be a rule that was made up by the chess class or the chess class,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:37:54.600000,00:37:57.800000,yeah probably probably it's helpful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:37:58.200000,00:38:02.600000,like the chess rules very rarely get changed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,4,00:38:02.600000,00:38:05.200000,we have a how class game it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,0,00:38:05.900000,00:38:10.500000,but I remember one time in the 1990s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,S2 ,,,0,00:38:10.500000,00:38:13.100000,it was changed it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:38:11.300000,00:58:54.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,5,00:38:11.400000,00:40:50.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:38:13.100000,00:38:20.800000,pause filler because it used to be that when you got your pawn to the other side you could transform it into any piece in the master competition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:38:21,00:38:26.500000,so a way the game could go where a player would win by transforming a piece into an enemy piece,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:38:31.900000,00:38:33.100000,,oh that works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:38:33.500000,00:38:36.600000,yeah and you weren't going to transform it into kings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:38:36.600000,00:38:37,but that was it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:38:37,00:38:47.400000,and it was basically like pause filler you stopped them from pause filler getting out of checkmate by stopping them from moving to that certain point or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:38:49.200000,00:38:58.300000,,oh she like she can stop or paying from going into checkmate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:38:59.300000,00:39:01.400000,yeah it's like you can (inaudible) your king from doing a checkmate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:01.400000,00:39:03.600000,or you can view,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:03.600000,00:39:10.200000,your opponent can move to by putting your opponent into checkmate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:10.200000,00:39:11,or if you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:11,00:39:12.900000,or they can move to or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:13.500000,00:39:14,,oh wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:14.100000,00:39:19.700000,oh so well got a problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:20.100000,00:39:22.900000,,we can imagine that it would be difficult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:23.900000,00:39:26.500000,,because you need to arm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:26.500000,00:39:28.700000,,which piece is the one that you control,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:30.500000,00:39:33,mm-hmm the thing is your opponent now controls what makes you (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,Na,00:39:33,00:39:37.400000,okay I got this problem down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:39:37.800000,00:39:46.100000,if you multiply both sides by x and divide both sides by twenty-five you get as one twenty-five which makes sense,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:39:46.100000,00:39:51.300000,because one divided by pause filler one divided by twenty-five is sort of equal twenty-two,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:39:51.700000,00:39:55.200000,and so one divided by a number of that number is a reciprocal,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:39:55.700000,00:40:03.700000,one divided by twenty-fifth is therefore twenty-five,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,4,00:40:13.200000,00:40:13.500000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,1,1.0,5,00:40:15.100000,00:40:53.300000,okay eighty pause filler eighty pause filler so like I could do this (inaudible) actually (inaudible) about y then dividing by eighty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:40:50.500000,00:44:39.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:40:53.900000,00:40:58.600000,the simple way to do that is just to switch with you out right yeah,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:40:59.300000,00:41:10.200000,,trying to match this up to something okay oh,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:41:10.500000,00:41:31.600000,,oh okay wait are you getting under the y and pause filler the stuff right here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:41:31.900000,00:41:33.900000,pause filler the y is over here,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:41:34.700000,00:41:36.800000,basically I did two things at once,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:41:37.400000,00:41:41.700000,I multiplied by y to get negative equals eighty y,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:41:41.700000,00:41:44,then just divide both sides by eighty,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:41:44.600000,00:41:49.700000,then I can easily be done just fixing the possessions of the y and the eighty,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:41:59.100000,00:42:33.800000,,it's like I'm going to test tablet if and that (inaudible) wrong but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:42:34.100000,00:42:42.600000,,and it's like it's doing a different way in the book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:42:42.600000,00:42:46.300000,okay pause filler how is it doing it,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:42:46.400000,00:42:51.300000,I'm not actually a wire of the generally accepted pause filler way to do problems like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,IDQ
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:42:51.300000,00:42:53.300000,,it will be like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:42:54.200000,00:43:00.500000,,it's kind of more of the seventeen then pause filler getting rid of the variable on this side pause filler,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:43:02.100000,00:43:06.400000,so yeah how is it getting more of is it multiplying both sides by y,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:43:06.400000,00:43:08.400000,,yeah just multiplying both sides by y,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:43:08.400000,00:43:10.900000,,and then it's getting rid of,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:43:11,00:43:13.700000,,it would be getting rid of the eighty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:43:13.700000,00:43:15.700000,so yeah it divides by five by eighty right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:43:17.200000,00:43:21.400000,,I mean the answer is the same format as the answer in this one,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:43:21.800000,00:43:26.500000,I'm doing the same thing basically and just getting us back by saying about,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:43:26.900000,00:43:29.200000,I know it's the same if I flop these two out,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:43:30.800000,00:43:33.400000,,which two oh,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:43:33.400000,00:43:35.800000,the y and the eighty,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,3,00:43:36.800000,00:43:39.600000,,okay okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,3,00:43:49.600000,00:43:51.100000,so minus fifty-four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,3,00:43:53.400000,00:43:59.100000,,okay so pause filler the next thing here (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:43:59.200000,00:44:34.100000,pause filler so well well it's one hundred two minus forty hundred minus thirty-eight seventy minus eight sixty-two here four over k (inaudible) equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,2,1.0,4,00:44:35.100000,00:44:41.900000,pause filler it's supposed to be sixty-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:44:39.800000,00:52:47.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:44:41.900000,00:44:48.300000,so four all right I did my contraction correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:44:48.300000,00:44:53.200000,there like forty one o two minus,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:44:53.200000,00:45:02,,wait what number or symbol is like this right here,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:45:02,00:45:13.300000,pause filler oh I'm subtracting fifty-four from both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:45:13.700000,00:45:15.100000,,it's a five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:45:15.100000,00:45:15.500000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:45:15.900000,00:45:21.800000,,okay okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:45:22.700000,00:45:23.300000,,okay yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:45:25.600000,00:45:29.600000,pause filler yeah then this can be simplified,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:45:29.600000,00:45:35,so this is ten k equals over thirteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:45:35,00:45:36,okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:45:46.500000,00:45:48,wait it does not make (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:45:48,00:45:54.100000,pause filler I have the number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:45:54.100000,00:45:58,pause filler I think that makes sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:45:59.200000,00:46:07.300000,pause filler two that's one hundred okay or,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:46:08,00:46:14.800000,,that's one hundred and sixteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:46:15.400000,00:46:27.600000,okay so I got it right like right now from (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:46:17,00:46:18,,pause filler (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:46:27.700000,00:46:31.100000,,maybe pause filler so I'm attempting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:46:31.800000,00:46:37,,they're not there (inaudible) but attempting to match this up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:46:37,00:46:39.400000,,pause filler do you like this system,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,

18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:46:49.300000,00:46:51.900000,,like I would teach you about science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:46:51.900000,00:46:58.900000,,and then you would teach me about history,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:00.200000,00:47:02,yeah something like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:02.100000,00:47:07.300000,,yeah so we kind of eliminate the aspect of somebody being better than the other I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,IDQ/IDS,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:07.400000,00:47:10.900000,I think what they're trying to do with where and about how people learn about math pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:10.900000,00:47:21.200000,,I think you're definitely better at math than me,,,,,,,,,MCRP,,LPA,,,,SV,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:22.200000,00:47:23.600000,pause filler I might have made a mistake here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:24,00:47:30,,the first stuff (inaudible) were here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:30.500000,00:47:31.800000,,that sounds right,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,3,00:47:31.800000,00:47:38,yeah but if one sixteen minus fifty-four were equal to sixty-two,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:47:38.300000,00:47:39.900000,let me work that out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:47:45.900000,00:47:47.700000,but I was doing in my head for the rest of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:47:47.700000,00:47:56.200000,,pause filler let's see so I mean it's fifty minus a hundred and fourteen essentially,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:47:57.700000,00:48:04,,so fifty-four I think it will be sixty-four wouldn't that,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:48:04,00:48:05.100000,pause filler let me think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,1,00:48:05.600000,00:48:09.700000,no it has to end in a two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,1,00:48:09.900000,00:48:14.300000,because six minus four is two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:50:05.800000,00:50:08.300000,yeah it's four over sixty-two isn't it,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:50:09.500000,00:50:18.200000,,oh like I'm really confused,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:50:18.400000,00:50:29.900000,,okay so in the next step on this they are multiplying each side by k or by the variable so,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:50:29.900000,00:50:32.700000,,and that's the second step,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:50:33.200000,00:50:35.300000,yeah that's essentially what I'm doing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:50:36,00:50:38.400000,it's the same by a full,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:50:38.400000,00:50:43.900000,like do we both get to come out to k for over sixty-two at some point,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:50:43.900000,00:50:55.600000,,wait pause filler I feel like you did two steps in one somewhere right here,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:50:55.600000,00:50:59.900000,yeah that's what I did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:51:00.200000,00:51:27.300000,,okay yeah because this is the step that is not in you in your problem okay okay oops to be correct,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,7,00:51:27.600000,00:51:42,okay it's a k equals two over thirty-one,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,7,00:51:42.600000,00:51:47.400000,,and then you need to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,7,00:51:47.500000,00:51:49,,pause filler I think it's correct,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,7,00:51:50.300000,00:51:57.400000,,yeah I'm pretty sure that's correct,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,7,00:51:58,00:51:58.100000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,7,00:51:58.200000,00:51:58.700000,,pause filler I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:51:59,00:52:09.400000,,I'd like to (inaudible) next second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:52:09.900000,00:52:20.100000,okay pause filler we're getting the fourteen over four hundred k or a thirty times nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:52:24.100000,00:52:55.800000,,so it would be negative two over three or five okay (inaudible) that in a moment,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,3,1.0,4,00:52:56.800000,00:52:59.100000,,y is equals to negative one fifteenth,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:53:01.900000,00:56:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:53:03.600000,00:54:13.300000,,so you first said is multiplying both sides by y,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:54:13.800000,00:54:18.100000,yeah and dividing both sides by two hundred ten and simplify them,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:54:18.900000,00:54:19.100000,,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:54:28.200000,00:54:32.600000,negative fourteen over two hundred ten simplifies to negative one fifteenth I believe,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:54:32.800000,00:54:33.300000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,3,00:54:37.800000,00:54:46.400000,seventy plus one hundred forty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,3,00:54:47.900000,00:54:48.300000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,3,00:54:53.300000,00:54:53.400000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,3,00:54:53.400000,00:55:00.300000,,okay okay so it's actually right,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,3,00:55:00.300000,00:55:04.400000,,pause filler I think your answer is right,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:55:11.200000,00:55:13.500000,so add twenty-four to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:55:15,00:55:32.600000,okay so two hundred forty (inaudible) five over x equals one hundred thirty-seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,4,00:55:34,00:55:51.100000,four x equals five over one thirty-seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,4,1.0,2,00:55:51.400000,00:56:18.700000,,wait one second okay pause filler okay pause filler okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,5,1.0,1,00:56:18.200000,00:58:23.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,5,1.0,3,00:56:31.700000,00:57:24.600000,interesting pause filler over pause filler what's both as a person will do is pause filler forty-nine over five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,2,T2 ,5,1.0,3,00:57:27,00:57:31.900000,because it's a free country,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,

3,1,S1 ,,,5,00:03:43.600000,00:03:49.700000,yeah pause filler so I guess we're supposed to work through these problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,5,00:03:51.400000,00:03:51.700000,not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,5,00:03:51.700000,00:03:57.500000,,all right so just get rid of the scribbles I guess so that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,5,00:03:57.600000,00:03:59.300000,okay so pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,3,00:04:02.900000,00:04:06,so like what I do is before I started erasing the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,3,00:04:06.300000,00:04:08.600000,so I think I'm just going to have to rewrite that problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,3,00:04:10.200000,00:04:13.800000,and that did okay adjacent pencil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,3,00:04:14.500000,00:04:22.800000,pause filler let's see three plus x equals twenty-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,3,00:04:22.800000,00:04:24,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:27.600000,00:04:33.100000,so I assume you probably know how to solve this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:33.400000,00:04:33.700000,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:33.700000,00:04:35.400000,,pause filler sorry you're tutoring me first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:35.600000,00:04:37.900000,that's what I think they said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:37.900000,00:04:38,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:38.500000,00:04:46.800000,so I guess pause filler you need to get x on leave only a thing on one side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:46.800000,00:04:48.900000,so you're going to have to get rid of three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:49,00:04:52.300000,,yeah so would you have to subtract three from both sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:52.600000,00:04:53.700000,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:53.700000,00:04:55.700000,so can you do it on there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:56,00:04:56.400000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,S1 ,,,2,00:04:56.600000,00:04:57.200000,,do you see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,,,5,00:07:14.700000,00:07:16.600000,,pause filler x minus six equals thirteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,,,5,00:07:16.600000,00:07:16.700000,pause filler no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,,,5,00:07:17.600000,00:07:21.500000,pause filler I don't know I don't know so you want me to get to that one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,1,0.0,5,00:07:36.200000,00:08:21.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,1,,3,00:07:36.300000,00:07:37.300000,okay so pause filler as we're doing equal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,1,,3,00:07:37.300000,00:07:41.500000,so I wonder if I can circle all right here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,1,,3,00:07:52,00:07:54.700000,,yeah so you would have to add six right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,1,,3,00:07:55.200000,00:07:55.700000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,1,,3,00:07:55.700000,00:07:58.500000,so do you want to add six to both of those sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,1,,5,00:08:04.700000,00:08:06.500000,,so pause filler you add six,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,1,,5,00:08:06.500000,00:08:08.800000,,and then you get x equals nineteen,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,1,,5,00:08:09.900000,00:08:10.300000,,oh gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,1,,5,00:08:10.300000,00:08:13.800000,so okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,1,,5,00:08:14.800000,00:08:17.400000,,oh that didn't work yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,1,,5,00:08:17.600000,00:08:21.100000,but do you know how to get to the next problem,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,1,,5,00:08:26.800000,00:08:29.900000,pause filler okay for this one it's sort of the same thing,,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,2,1.0,2,00:08:29.600000,00:09:10.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,2,,6,00:08:29.900000,00:08:34.500000,so you want to get pause filler or does the eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,2,,6,00:08:34.500000,00:08:39.900000,,yeah and that's a negative so you would have to add it,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,2,,6,00:08:39.900000,00:08:53.300000,yeah just like the last one,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,3,,2,00:09:17.900000,00:09:21,okay pause filler so this one is a lot like the other ones,,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,3,,2,00:09:21,00:09:23.600000,except for this one yeah you don't want to add it,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,3,,2,00:09:23.600000,00:09:25.300000,,yeah so you have to subtract,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,3,,3,00:09:26.100000,00:09:32.400000,,so you would subtract eleven because it's a positive right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,3,,3,00:09:32.500000,00:09:32.900000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,3,,3,00:09:33.400000,00:09:35.200000,,all right so minus eleven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,3,,3,00:09:42.900000,00:09:44.200000,,then those who cancel out,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,3,,3,00:09:44.200000,00:09:46,,so it would be k equals six,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,1,T1 ,3,,3,00:09:46.400000,00:09:46.700000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,3,,3,00:09:50.600000,00:10:00.800000,okay so this time we pause filler yeah only one term on the other side so yeah,,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:09:57.900000,00:11:56.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,3,00:10:00.800000,00:10:03.500000,pause filler so you want to get rid of the forty-four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,3,00:10:03.500000,00:10:06,so the coefficient of x is one so,,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,3,00:10:06.600000,00:10:12.700000,,yeah pause filler so you want to get rid of the forty-four so the coefficient of x is one so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,3,00:10:12.700000,00:10:13.100000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,3,00:10:14.800000,00:10:17,do you know how to do that,,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,4,,3,00:10:17.900000,00:10:21.400000,,so you'd have to divide because it's multiplication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,3,00:10:21.400000,00:10:22.500000,,then you do the opposites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,3,00:10:22.500000,00:10:23.900000,,so divided by forty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,3,00:10:23.900000,00:10:24.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,3,00:10:25.600000,00:10:26.500000,,it's so weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:10:30.200000,00:10:34.900000,,because I'm so accustomed in my class to using calculators like she lets s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:10:34.900000,00:10:36.500000,I know yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:10:36.500000,00:10:37.500000,,so divide it,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:10:37.500000,00:10:40.300000,on personal calculators and I just pull it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:10:40.600000,00:10:43.500000,,yeah wait oh gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:10:43.500000,00:10:48.300000,,is this what even is this then (laughter),,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:10:53.300000,00:11:02.300000,,ten x equals twenty-two divided two hundred and twenty divided by forty-four,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:11:04.200000,00:11:07.100000,yeah I wonder if I could,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:11:07.600000,00:11:09.800000,pause filler so that's like a forty-four on that side,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:11:10,00:11:10.700000,that was lovely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:11:10.700000,00:11:11.800000,okay I know what I mean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:11:12.500000,00:11:13.800000,and two hundred twenty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:11:15,00:11:17.700000,see you can go I see like pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:11:19.100000,00:11:19.900000,,yeah yeah yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:11:19.900000,00:11:23,I just yeah okay how many times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:11:23,00:11:26.500000,it's like about five five ten,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:11:26.500000,00:11:28.800000,,oh yeah that would make sense so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,4,,4,00:11:38.600000,00:11:41.900000,,it seems so embarrassing because it's just like we're so used to using calculators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,4,00:11:41.900000,00:11:43.600000,,but it just yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,4,00:11:44.300000,00:11:45.700000,okay let's see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,4,,4,00:11:48,00:11:51.400000,it's pause filler a two yeah a two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,4,00:11:51.900000,00:11:53.200000,four times that that's also,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:12:27.900000,00:12:30.600000,,and I'm like right where I should be in my grade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:12:30.800000,00:12:32.800000,,and English is more my subject,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:12:32.800000,00:12:34.600000,,like I'm in advanced English all the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:12:34.600000,00:12:38.200000,,but math it's all right I just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
3,1,T1 ,4,,5,00:12:39.300000,00:12:39.900000,yeah so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:12:39.700000,00:13:38.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,5,00:12:39.900000,00:12:46.300000,,all right so now you add nine right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,5,00:12:46.500000,00:12:47.200000,yeah so (inaudible),,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,5,00:12:47.200000,00:12:51.600000,,so you add nine to this,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,5,00:12:51.600000,00:12:59.600000,,and then you're left with thirteen p equals fifty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,3,00:13:00.200000,00:13:00.500000,,so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,3,00:13:02.800000,00:13:08.600000,pause filler so then you want to give it to the thirteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,3,00:13:08.700000,00:13:10.600000,,so you divide it by thirteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,3,00:13:13.700000,00:13:16.100000,,wait does the fraction pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,3,00:13:18.200000,00:13:21.900000,,does the fifty divided by thirteen equal out to a fraction,ODQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,3,00:13:22.500000,00:13:23.800000,no I don't think it's simplified,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,3,00:13:23.800000,00:13:25.700000,I think it's just fifty over thirteen,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,3,00:13:25.700000,00:13:26.900000,,all right great,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,4,00:13:30,00:13:32.400000,,I thought that it could've been a simplified fraction,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,4,00:13:32.400000,00:13:33.300000,,I'm not sure,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,4,00:13:33.300000,00:13:35.800000,I mean like thirteen is like prawn numbers,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,5,,4,00:13:35.800000,00:13:38.100000,so it would not be that likely,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,1.0,4,00:13:38.200000,00:14:18.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:13:38.300000,00:13:41.600000,,yeah so with this one it's a little bit different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:13:41.600000,00:13:46.700000,,but you just subtract ten from both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:13:47.700000,00:13:48,yup,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:13:48.500000,00:13:51.100000,,so twenty-four,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:13:53.500000,00:14:00.100000,,and pause filler so you're left with six x equals twenty-four,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:14:00.100000,00:14:01.600000,,so then you divide by (laughter),,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:14:01.800000,00:14:04.100000,,sorry I'm getting over a cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:14:04.100000,00:14:05.200000,,so that's why I sound,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:14:05.400000,00:14:07.500000,pause filler yeah a six,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:14:08.700000,00:14:09.600000,,divided by six,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:14:09.600000,00:14:13.400000,,and then x equals four because twenty-four divided by six equals four,,,,,ER,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:14:13.700000,00:14:17.700000,yeah oh your equals signs are getting better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:14:17.700000,00:14:18.300000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,6,,4,00:14:18.400000,00:14:20.800000,okay next one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:14:20.300000,00:15:27.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,4,00:14:20.900000,00:14:23.400000,,all right so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,2,00:14:26.300000,00:14:30.600000,,with this one since that's a negative you add it right so,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,2,00:14:31.100000,00:14:31.600000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,2,00:14:40.900000,00:14:41.500000,,oh okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,2,00:14:44.300000,00:14:45.200000,,oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,2,00:14:45.400000,00:14:50.200000,,so that would equal,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,2,00:14:53.600000,00:14:58.800000,,sixty-two equals fifteen k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,2,00:14:58.800000,00:14:59.700000,,oh my god,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,3,00:15:00.300000,00:15:04.500000,,pause filler and then divide that by fifteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,3,00:15:07.400000,00:15:09,,so that would just be another,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,3,00:15:09.700000,00:15:10.300000,let's see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,3,00:15:10.300000,00:15:11.900000,where were we sixty-two (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,3,00:15:11.900000,00:15:12.100000,nope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,3,00:15:12.100000,00:15:17.700000,I'd say that no you can't simplify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
3,1,T1 ,7,,3,00:15:17.700000,00:15:19.200000,it maybe maybe not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,3,00:15:25.200000,00:15:26.700000,yeah because yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,7,,3,00:15:26.700000,00:15:27.300000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,1.0,2,00:15:28.700000,00:16:35.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,2,00:15:29.100000,00:15:32.800000,,so for this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,2,00:15:35.700000,00:15:36.700000,,subtract,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,2,00:15:37.400000,00:15:38,twelve,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,2,00:15:41.900000,00:15:51.500000,,sorry it's like it takes a minute for it to show up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,2,00:15:52.400000,00:15:55.500000,yeah real slow okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,6,00:15:56.400000,00:16:09.500000,so yeah twenty-one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,6,00:16:09.600000,00:16:10.100000,that's right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,6,00:16:10.200000,00:16:13.800000,,so then that cancels out obviously,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,6,00:16:14,00:16:14.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,6,00:16:14.800000,00:16:15.700000,,so plus,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,6,00:16:15.800000,00:16:18.400000,,oh no that equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,6,00:16:18.400000,00:16:21.700000,,twenty-one equals seven x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,6,00:16:22.100000,00:16:24.600000,,and then twenty-one is divisible by sevens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,6,00:16:24.600000,00:16:28.900000,,so that's pause filler divisible by three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,2,00:16:28.900000,00:16:32.200000,,so then pause filler x equals three,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,2,00:16:33.400000,00:16:34.300000,yup okay,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,2,00:16:36.700000,00:16:38.700000,,all right great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,8,,2,00:16:38.800000,00:16:39,,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,1.0,2,00:16:39,00:17:37.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:16:39,00:16:40.800000,,so this is a different one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:16:41.400000,00:16:46.600000,,so first you're going to get to pause filler you're going to do the variables first,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:16:46.800000,00:16:49.900000,,and then you do the one that's like less right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:16:49.900000,00:16:50.900000,yeah you do the less,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:16:50.900000,00:16:52.600000,because otherwise you'll have the negative p,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:16:52.600000,00:16:53.700000,and that's not that fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:16:53.800000,00:16:56.100000,,yeah so minus p,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:16:56.100000,00:16:57.700000,,and then minus p,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:16:58.300000,00:17:01,,so you end up with fifteen equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:01.400000,00:17:02,,oh gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:02.700000,00:17:04.500000,,got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:05.900000,00:17:11.100000,,pause filler fifteen sorry pause filler fifteen equals two p plus twelve,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:12.200000,00:17:12.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:12.900000,00:17:13.600000,,so then pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:13.600000,00:17:15.900000,it's just like the other problems,,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:15.900000,00:17:17.700000,,yeah now you subtract twelve,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:19.500000,00:17:21.800000,,so three equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:22.200000,00:17:22.700000,,oh god,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:24.300000,00:17:27.500000,,two p no,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,4,00:17:27.500000,00:17:29.900000,,no you divide it by two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:17:29.900000,00:17:33,,so you end up with three halves,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:17:35.100000,00:17:35.800000,yeah so,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:17:35.800000,00:17:37.700000,because you can't simplify that anymore,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,9,,2,00:17:37.700000,00:17:46.300000,,yeah all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,1.0,6,00:17:46.100000,00:19:35.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,2,00:17:46.300000,00:17:53.200000,okay so for this one yeah you want to start off by having only one k,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,1,00:17:56.100000,00:18:00,,so you have to subtract that anyway,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,1,00:18:01,00:18:04.500000,,subtract that from this,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,1,00:18:04.500000,00:18:06.100000,,so you would end up with negative ten,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,1,00:18:06.100000,00:18:08.400000,,because you leave the negative there equals,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,1,00:18:08.400000,00:18:09.100000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,1,00:18:10.100000,00:18:17.500000,,seven k minus sixty-eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,1,00:18:17.800000,00:18:25.700000,,then plus ten on both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,1,00:18:25.700000,00:18:25.700000,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:25.700000,00:18:31.700000,actually you wouldn't want to do the plus ten because then you'll have seven k equals yeah so,,,,,,,EV,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:31.700000,00:18:33.400000,,you add sixty-eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:33.600000,00:18:33.800000,yup,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:34.800000,00:18:36.900000,,I'm just going to write over it you know what,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:37.200000,00:18:40.300000,,so plus sixty-eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:40.500000,00:18:42.200000,,so that cancels out,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:42.500000,00:18:43.100000,,then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:45.600000,00:18:46.900000,,seventy-eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:49.700000,00:18:54.400000,,equals seven k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:54.400000,00:18:58,,wait is seventy-eight divided by seven divisible by seven I mean,ODQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:18:58,00:19:00.800000,wait no I think you messed up because that's a negative ten,,,,,,,EV,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:00.800000,00:19:02.900000,so it wouldn't be ten plus sixty,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:02.900000,00:19:06.800000,it would be ten minus it would be sixty-eight minus ten,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:07,00:19:07.900000,,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:08.100000,00:19:09.400000,yeah so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:09.400000,00:19:10.600000,,it would be fifty-eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:12.100000,00:19:14.200000,,so fifty-eight equals seven k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:14.200000,00:19:17.600000,,so is fifty-eight divisible by a seven,ODQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:17.600000,00:19:19.500000,,I can't talk I'm sorry pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDA,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:19.500000,00:19:22.600000,pause filler I don't think though because I don't remember that,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:22.600000,00:19:25.200000,fifty-six fifty-eight isn't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,4,00:19:25.500000,00:19:26.200000,,okay great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,6,00:19:27.100000,00:19:30.700000,so you can just here we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,6,00:19:31.400000,00:19:34.300000,,so k equals fifty-eight,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,6,00:19:35,00:19:35.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,10,,6,00:19:35.400000,00:19:43,,all right next stop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,0.0,3,00:19:43,00:22:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:19:43.200000,00:19:47.200000,pause filler okay to solve this problem you have to delete all the variables,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:19:50.500000,00:19:52,,wait so it said come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:19:52,00:19:52.800000,,and get us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:19:53,00:19:53.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:19:53.800000,00:19:56.800000,pause filler do you know where they are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,4,00:19:58.400000,00:20:00.200000,,pause filler I don't but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,4,00:20:00.200000,00:20:03.400000,okay maybe they're outside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,4,00:20:03.400000,00:20:05,I'll look and you will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,4,00:20:05.100000,00:20:06.300000,,all right I'll be right back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:20:41,00:20:42.800000,,all right great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:20:42.800000,00:20:44.500000,,so she's tutoring me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:20:44.600000,00:26:24.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:20:44.700000,00:20:45.200000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:20:45.300000,00:20:47.200000,okay yeah okay (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:20:47.200000,00:20:51.400000,so yeah you want to make sure one side has variables and one side doesn't,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:20:51.500000,00:20:55.600000,so which one do you want to start with,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,6,00:20:56.100000,00:20:58.400000,,pause filler let's just start with the variables,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,0,00:20:58.400000,00:21:01.600000,,so you subtract r,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,0,00:21:02.100000,00:21:06.400000,,so then you would just end up with r  because you don't say one r because it's all yeah,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,0,00:21:06.400000,00:21:06.700000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,0,00:21:06.800000,00:21:11.500000,,so you keep the negative thirty-three equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,0,00:21:15.100000,00:21:17.600000,,r minus fifteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,0,00:21:19.900000,00:21:25.900000,,and then you add fifteen to both sides right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,0,00:21:27.300000,00:21:27.700000,yup,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:21:31.500000,00:21:31.900000,,so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:21:32.100000,00:21:39.200000,so then you would that would be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:21:39.300000,00:21:42.800000,,so negative three plus negative thirty-three plus fifteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:21:43.600000,00:21:44.500000,is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:21:45.700000,00:21:47.200000,pause filler that's a negative three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:21:47.200000,00:21:55.400000,I just want to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:21:56,00:21:58.900000,pause filler that would be a negative twelve I'm pretty sure,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:22:05.100000,00:22:08.300000,,oh wait don't you always want to end up with a variable on the left side,ODQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:22:09.200000,00:22:11.900000,pause filler I'm pretty sure that doesn't matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:22:11.900000,00:22:13.800000,but yeah if you want to write that around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:22:13.800000,00:22:15.400000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,11,,3,00:22:15.400000,00:22:15.900000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,1.0,2,00:22:17.200000,00:23:33.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:22:17.500000,00:22:21.200000,,negative forty-two plus u equals eight plus four u so,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:22:22.400000,00:22:25.200000,so want to get for the variable again,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:22:25.900000,00:22:28.700000,,yeah you subtract u from both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:22:28.700000,00:22:34.200000,,so you'd end up with negative forty-two equals eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:22:37.200000,00:22:40.500000,,plus three u now,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:22:41.500000,00:22:42.200000,,so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:22:42.600000,00:22:44.800000,now you want to get rid of that eight,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:22:46.500000,00:22:48.300000,oh that's fun underlining stuff (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:22:51,00:22:54.100000,,so then you subtract eight from this,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:22:54.400000,00:23:00.300000,,so since it's a negative you would base yeah I'm just thinking of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:23:01.300000,00:23:03.100000,yes so it would still be a negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:23:03.100000,00:23:05.700000,,oh so yeah it would still be a negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:23:05.700000,00:23:07.800000,,so you're basically just adding it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:23:07.800000,00:23:10.100000,,but it's a negative kind of,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:23:10.200000,00:23:10.600000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:23:10.700000,00:23:17.900000,,yeah yeah so you would obviously end up with negative fifty equals three u,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:23:17.900000,00:23:21.700000,,and then fifty isn't divisible by three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,3,00:23:22.200000,00:23:25.300000,,so just divide it by three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,2,00:23:25.400000,00:23:31.300000,,and then u equals oh fifty over three,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,2,00:23:31.900000,00:23:32.900000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,12,,2,00:23:34.100000,00:23:34.600000,,so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,1.0,5,00:23:35.900000,00:24:33.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,2,00:23:36.500000,00:23:39.900000,I'll pick numbers okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,2,00:23:41.400000,00:23:49.300000,,so you're just going to add no subtract n,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,2,00:23:49.300000,00:23:52.300000,,just forget I put that sign there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,2,00:23:53.300000,00:23:55.300000,,pause filler subtract n from both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,3,00:23:55.900000,00:24:08.800000,,so what you end up with one of six equals ninety-nine n plus seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,3,00:24:10.100000,00:24:12.900000,,and then u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,3,00:24:13.600000,00:24:15.600000,,do you subtract seven next,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,3,00:24:16.200000,00:24:18.200000,pause filler yeah you want to subtract the seven,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,3,00:24:18.600000,00:24:22.700000,,so you that you end up with ninety-nine on this side also,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,3,00:24:22.700000,00:24:23.800000,,so ninety-nine equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,3,00:24:23.800000,00:24:24.300000,that would be easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,3,00:24:24.500000,00:24:25.100000,,ninety-nine,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,3,00:24:25.100000,00:24:28.500000,,and then obviously that divides into one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,5,00:24:28.500000,00:24:31.300000,,so n equals one,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,5,00:24:31.600000,00:24:33.200000,,that was an easy problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,5,00:24:33.400000,00:24:35.400000,yeah that (inaudible) numbers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,5,00:24:35.500000,00:24:36.600000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,13,,5,00:24:37.700000,00:24:38.400000,,so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,1.0,3,00:24:39.900000,00:26:04.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:24:40.400000,00:24:40.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:24:41.100000,00:24:42.700000,,fifty-five all right great,,,,,,,RP,,,,UL,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:24:42.700000,00:24:46.400000,,so you subtract g this time because,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:24:46.800000,00:24:52.800000,it's so that will less oh I want to try with g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:24:54,00:24:57.200000,there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:24:58.100000,00:24:59.300000,,fifty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:25:01.400000,00:25:02.800000,,I can't even write on this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:25:02.800000,00:25:04,,wait I'm just going to go back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:25:05.700000,00:25:07.300000,you want with the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:25:07.300000,00:25:07.900000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:25:08.500000,00:25:12.200000,,so fifty-five minus,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:25:16.800000,00:25:24,,no like I'm sorry fifty-five equals seven plus twelve g,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:25:24.400000,00:25:24.600000,yup,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:25:25.700000,00:25:27,,so then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:25:29,00:25:29.800000,,plus,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:25:31.600000,00:25:33.200000,,no it's minus seven right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:25:33.400000,00:25:35.100000,yeah you want as good as positive,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:25:35.700000,00:25:36.800000,,so minus seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:25:37.700000,00:25:43.900000,,and then that would end up being forty-eight yeah forty-eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:25:44,00:25:44.700000,yeah forty-eight,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:25:44.700000,00:25:49.500000,(inaudible) oh yeah because I want to subtract the two,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:25:50.200000,00:25:56,,so forty-eight is pause filler that's twelve times four right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,5,00:25:57.500000,00:25:57.800000,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:25:57.800000,00:26:00.500000,that's what so you'd want to divide the twelve,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:26:00.700000,00:26:04.700000,,so g equals four great,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,14,,3,00:26:05.900000,00:26:11.500000,and okay and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,15,1.0,3,00:26:09.900000,00:26:24.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,15,,3,00:26:11.500000,00:26:18.500000,,all right so you would want to start out by subtracting the n,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,15,,3,00:26:19.500000,00:26:23.100000,,and then doing that on both sides and,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,15,,0,00:26:30,00:26:30.200000,,huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T1 ,15,,0,00:26:31.100000,00:26:31.700000,,oh it's doing great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T2 ,1,,0,00:36:23.100000,00:36:27.400000,okay so start off you want to add three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,0,00:36:28.700000,00:36:29,,yeah,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:29.400000,00:36:36.300000,that was a thirteen (laughter) x equals twenty-five here we go,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:36.300000,00:36:41.700000,,all right great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:41.800000,00:36:42.900000,let me see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:43.100000,00:36:45.700000,pause filler you change it do you know how to change it,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:45.700000,00:36:46.800000,or should I change it for you,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:46.800000,00:36:48.400000,oh this is the page I see okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:50.100000,00:36:51.900000,,so this is a negative,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:51.900000,00:36:53.600000,,so we start off by adding,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:54.800000,00:36:56.800000,okay so adding y,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:57.100000,00:36:57.600000,here we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,6,00:36:58.200000,00:36:59.100000,wait no not the y,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,2,00:36:59.100000,00:37:00.200000,,oh not the y,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,2,00:37:00.200000,00:37:03.400000,but you know I guess you could do that right yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
3,1,T2 ,1,,2,00:37:04.900000,00:37:08.600000,,no no you shouldn't do that,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,2,00:37:08.600000,00:37:09.300000,,wait let's go back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,2,00:37:09.300000,00:37:10,,let's go back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,2,00:37:10.500000,00:37:11.600000,,that was wrong (laughter),,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,2,00:37:12.400000,00:37:17.500000,,okay so you want to start off by subtracting eighteen from both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,2,00:37:18.100000,00:37:27.800000,okay okay negative y equals five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,2,00:37:28.500000,00:37:29.200000,,yeah great,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,5,00:37:29.200000,00:37:31.800000,,so just remember that pause filler there's a negative in front of it,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,5,00:37:31.800000,00:37:33.500000,,so that means that there's a negative one,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,5,00:37:34.100000,00:37:36.400000,,so divide that by negative one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,5,00:37:36.400000,00:37:41.700000,,and you'll get your answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,5,00:37:41.700000,00:37:45.500000,okay y equals negative five,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,5,00:37:46.100000,00:37:46.600000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,1,,5,00:37:46.600000,00:37:47.900000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,1.0,2,00:37:49.400000,00:40:02.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,5,00:37:49.700000,00:37:52.300000,,this one is a little bit different pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:37:52.900000,00:37:56.800000,,so what do you think you're going to start off by doing,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:37:56.800000,00:38:03.800000,pause filler so for this one we want since there's pause filler I guess there's two ks,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:38:03.800000,00:38:08.400000,so pause filler you would want to get rid of one of the k,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:38:08.600000,00:38:10.400000,,yeah you should start off with the variable,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:38:11.300000,00:38:16.300000,so we're going to add a k so that it cancels out the other k,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:38:14,00:38:16,,(sfx),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:38:17.900000,00:38:20.300000,are you okay,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:38:21.300000,00:38:22.900000,,yeah I'm okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:38:22.900000,00:38:23.300000,,thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:38:24,00:38:29.900000,so we have negative fourteen equals thirty-six plus two k,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,5,00:38:29.900000,00:38:32.400000,,all right great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,5,00:38:32.400000,00:38:33.800000,,so you end up with two k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,5,00:38:34.200000,00:38:41.400000,,so now since pause filler this is a negative fourteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,5,00:38:41.600000,00:38:43.900000,,what are you going to need though,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,5,00:38:43.900000,00:38:49,I'm going to add it so (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,5,00:38:49,00:38:54,,well you would be doing it to the thirty-six remember because that's alone on the other side,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,5,00:38:55.100000,00:38:58.100000,yeah but you also want to do it to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,2,00:38:58.500000,00:39:00.400000,so I guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,2,00:39:00.400000,00:39:01.500000,,I know but would you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,2,00:39:01.500000,00:39:02.800000,oh yeah oh that oh oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,2,00:39:02.800000,00:39:05.700000,,you would want to be subtracting thirty-six,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,2,00:39:11,00:39:14.300000,(laughter) okay I did not see it,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,2,00:39:14.300000,00:39:15,,it's okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,2,00:39:15,00:39:16.700000,,it was my fault,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,2,00:39:17.600000,00:39:25.300000,okay so hurry up pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,2,00:39:26.200000,00:39:29.500000,so now you want to subtract with thirty-six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:39:32.200000,00:39:35.700000,yeah thirty-six okay,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:39:36.500000,00:39:43.300000,and then you get pause filler negative fifty equals two k,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:39:43.900000,00:39:49.400000,,all right so then you would want to divide by two on both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,3,00:39:52.800000,00:39:56.900000,yeah equals negative twenty-five,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,3,,2,00:39:58.300000,00:40:02,and we're good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,4,1.0,0,00:40:02.600000,00:41:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:40:02.700000,00:40:03.200000,,yup,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:40:03.200000,00:40:13.100000,,all right so pause filler for this one you can do you should do the variable first always,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:40:13.100000,00:40:28.800000,,but you should start off by adding b on this side because sorry I just wrote over that pause filler you should start off by adding b because even though they both look the same that pause filler is worth less,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,IDA/IDQ,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:40:28.800000,00:40:32,,and you should always add and subtract the one that,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:40:32.800000,00:40:43.100000,okay so add b here and like the other following get seventeen thirteen plus two b,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:40:43.100000,00:40:43.900000,and okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:40:44.900000,00:40:49,so now we need to make sure the b is on only one side,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:40:49.100000,00:40:51.700000,and to do that you have to subtract the thirteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:40:52.100000,00:40:52.400000,,right,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:40:53.200000,00:40:54.200000,not the seventeen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:40:55.400000,00:40:59.700000,and you get four equals two b,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:40:59.700000,00:41:03.400000,and then you want to divide the two divide the two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:41:03.900000,00:41:06.600000,and you get two equals three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:41:06.900000,00:41:08.600000,and b equals two,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,5,1.0,4,00:41:09.200000,00:41:40.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:41:09.300000,00:41:09.700000,here we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:41:09.700000,00:41:14.700000,,all right so this one is a little bit easier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:41:14.700000,00:41:16.300000,,and you're multiplying,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:41:16.300000,00:41:20.100000,,so what are you going to do to solve the equation,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:41:20.600000,00:41:23.300000,so this one you want to measure g alone,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:41:23.300000,00:41:27.200000,and since it's multiplying the negative nine by the g one you divide the negative nine,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:41:27.300000,00:41:27.900000,,correct,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:28.300000,00:41:31.800000,that okay negative nine negative nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:34,00:41:38.300000,and g equals negative nine,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:38.500000,00:41:39.900000,there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,6,1.0,5,00:41:41.400000,00:42:37.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:41.600000,00:41:43.600000,,all right great,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:43.600000,00:41:44.800000,,and now next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:45.400000,00:41:48.800000,,all right so for this one it's different than the last one,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:49.200000,00:41:57.700000,,and it's like what we've been doing but pause filler you would be subtracting ten to start off,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:41:58.200000,00:42:07.100000,I see so seventy-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:13,00:42:16.700000,okay so now you want to get rid of the eight right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:17.400000,00:42:17.700000,,yes,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:17.700000,00:42:22.500000,,so you would have to pause filler divide by negative eight in both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:22.900000,00:42:28.800000,,and let me know if you need help on that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:30.500000,00:42:31.200000,(inaudible) that's nine,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:31.500000,00:42:31.900000,,yeah,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:32.400000,00:42:34.500000,,well you remember it would be negative nine,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:35.400000,00:42:37.100000,yeah so there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:37.600000,00:42:38,,great,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:38,00:42:39.400000,,all right next page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,7,1.0,6,00:42:39.600000,00:44:23.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:39.800000,00:42:43.100000,,one hundred seventy equals sixty-five minus fourteen x,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:44.800000,00:42:51,okay so for this one you want to subtract the sixty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:54.100000,00:42:55.400000,here we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:42:55.600000,00:42:56.400000,yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:43:00.200000,00:43:02.800000,,all right all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:43:06.700000,00:43:13.900000,,so you just make sure you know that like you seem to be you seem to know,,,,,,,,,MCRP,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:43:13.900000,00:43:22.400000,,but I mean just the role is always like depending on whether it's positive or negative just add or subtract and everything,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:43:22.900000,00:43:31.800000,yeah okay so pause filler now we got to subtract okay one hundred seven sixty-five is two like,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:43:31.800000,00:43:35.400000,I'm going to say that's forty-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:43:37.300000,00:43:44.900000,so forty-two equals negative fourteen x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:43:47.300000,00:43:48.300000,,yeah yeah,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:43:48.300000,00:43:54.600000,okay so and how we will want to pause filler divide by negative fourteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:43:57.200000,00:44:00.100000,not the x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:44:00.100000,00:44:08.500000,,so pause filler is ninety-two divided by negative I can't talk is ninety-two divided by divisible by negative fourteen,ODQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:44:09.300000,00:44:10.200000,actually maybe let's see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:44:10.200000,00:44:12.600000,wait fourteen times three happens,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:44:14.500000,00:44:14.800000,yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:44:15.400000,00:44:22.600000,yeah so we have pause filler x equals negative three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:44:22.900000,00:44:23.300000,,great,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:44:23.500000,00:44:27.300000,,all right onto the next problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,8,1.0,4,00:44:23.500000,00:45:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:44:27.300000,00:44:28.400000,,you're moving fast,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:44:29.200000,00:44:33.400000,,all right so pause filler this has bigger numbers in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:44:33.400000,00:44:37.200000,,but you would start off by adding what number,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:44:38.100000,00:44:38.700000,forty-one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:44:38.700000,00:44:38.900000,,yup,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:44:38.900000,00:44:47.300000,that looks like an h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:44:47.500000,00:44:50.600000,yeah that's horrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:44:51.400000,00:45:00,pause filler yes so that would be seventy-five equals negative nine k divided by the negative nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:44:51.400000,00:45:00,,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:00.700000,00:45:04.900000,,so you just want to make that equal on both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:09.400000,00:45:14.500000,would you say seventy-five divided by negative nine,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:15.200000,00:45:15.700000,here we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:15.800000,00:45:17.800000,,all right great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,9,0.0,2,00:45:18.500000,00:46:31.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:18.600000,00:45:21.500000,,so now this one is a lot different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:22.300000,00:45:26.900000,,so pause filler you would have to start off by adding p to both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:26.900000,00:45:29.100000,,so what would you add it to on the other side,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:29.500000,00:45:32.400000,so I guess you want to so that would be nine p,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:32.800000,00:45:34.400000,so you want to add the p yeah,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:35.100000,00:45:39,so if you do it to both sides we got the negative fifty-two here,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:39.300000,00:45:41.400000,we got the nine p over here,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:41.400000,00:45:47.200000,we got the negative sixteen which we need to now add so that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:45:47.200000,00:45:51.500000,,yeah just remember that you always have to keep that negative there because that's important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:45:54.300000,00:46:01.100000,so it would be fifty-two minus sixteen which happens to be fourteen that would be forty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:46:01.400000,00:46:06.900000,I'm pretty sure that would be thirty-six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:46:07.100000,00:46:07.400000,,yeah,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:46:07.700000,00:46:13.300000,that seems like (inaudible) okay thirty-six equals nine p,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:46:16.600000,00:46:19.500000,pause filler okay so then we want to divide it by nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:46:19.500000,00:46:22.400000,and we get pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:46:22.400000,00:46:22.500000,,four,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:46:22.500000,00:46:24.600000,p equals four,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:46:24.600000,00:46:29.200000,I feel like there's a lot of nines in here okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:46:29.400000,00:46:31.200000,,all right great,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:46:32,00:46:32.900000,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,10,2.0,2,00:46:32.400000,00:47:56.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:46:33,00:46:35.400000,,next one up and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:46:35.400000,00:46:40.500000,,so you're going to add,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:46:43.100000,00:46:45,the pause filler fourteen w,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:46:45.400000,00:46:45.900000,,yes,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:46:46.900000,00:46:56.100000,,so that equals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:46:56.900000,00:47:01.200000,pause filler negative forty-one equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:47:02.800000,00:47:07.900000,pause filler I'll say forty forty w,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDS
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:47:09.100000,00:47:09.800000,,correct,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:47:10.200000,00:47:15.700000,oh wait and we don't want to figure about that nineteen plus,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:47:16.200000,00:47:21.100000,okay so now subtract the nineteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:47:23.800000,00:47:28.900000,and okay to make it a hundred,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:47:30.300000,00:47:35.900000,be a negative a hundred sixty equals forty w,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:47:38,00:47:40.400000,here we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:47:40.400000,00:47:47.600000,okay (inaudible) by forty and that would be negative four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:47:48,00:47:50.100000,yeah w equals negative four,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:47:50.600000,00:47:56.300000,,yeah because remember just regular sixteen divided by four equals four so,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:47:57,00:48:04.900000,yeah I wonder what all these buttons are doing okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:48:05.500000,00:48:08.500000,pause filler continuing on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:48:44.200000,00:48:45.200000,,all right great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,1,00:48:46.100000,00:54:24.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:48:46.200000,00:48:55.200000,okay so all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,11,1.0,4,00:48:53.900000,00:50:39.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:48:55.100000,00:49:05,,so first you want to start off by adding y because it's negative n,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:05,00:49:14.300000,and then we get negative sixty-three equals forty-three plus two y,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:17.700000,00:49:19.700000,,so what do you think the next step is,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:21.700000,00:49:24.300000,I think well we've got to get rid of that forty-three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDS
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:24.400000,00:49:24.600000,kill it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:24.600000,00:49:30.600000,okay so we want to subtract forty-three forty-three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:30.800000,00:49:32.500000,,that cancels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:33.100000,00:49:38,yeah yeah like here we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:39.200000,00:49:44,oh come on now okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:44,00:49:47.800000,yeah we want to pause filler add yeah subtract them together,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:47.800000,00:49:54.100000,we got a hundred and six equals two y,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,0,00:49:55.700000,00:49:57.800000,so divide it by two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:50:00.400000,00:50:03.900000,and get y equals fifty-three pause filler,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:50:07.500000,00:50:17.200000,,all right so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:50:18.200000,00:50:19.300000,,oh gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:32.200000,00:50:35.300000,okay maybe we should just go to the next one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:35.300000,00:50:37.100000,,yeah did you get the answer,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:37.300000,00:50:38.500000,mm-hmm y equals fifty-three,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:38.500000,00:50:39.300000,right over there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,12,1.0,1,00:50:41.600000,00:52:02.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:41.800000,00:50:46.500000,okay now they're all like negative p and positive p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:46.700000,00:50:48.700000,,yeah so you would want to start up by adding p,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:51:01.600000,00:51:03.100000,equals two p okay,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:51:05.500000,00:51:12.900000,and then pause filler you want to pause filler get rid of three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,5,00:51:14.200000,00:51:24.800000,that was totally necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:51:26.700000,00:51:35.700000,pause filler see pause filler a hundred ninety pause filler negative,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:51:43.400000,00:51:45.500000,pause filler thirty equals two p,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:51:47,00:51:47.500000,,great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:51:48.600000,00:51:50.700000,,so then what is that divided by two,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,1,00:51:52.100000,00:52:02.400000,p equals negative one hundred and fifteen okay,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,13,1.0,3,00:52:03.100000,00:53:08.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T2 ,,,1,00:52:06.400000,00:52:16.200000,seems like it really come with me okay it would just add pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:52:31.500000,00:52:31.900000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,2,00:52:31.900000,00:52:32.200000,pause filler nah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:53:11.100000,00:53:16.100000,,all right so add m to start off,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:53:16.100000,00:53:18,,and make it equal on both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,3,00:53:18.800000,00:53:28.600000,yup I didn't get where that m,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:53:31.500000,00:53:33.900000,,just rewrite the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:53:34.200000,00:53:39.200000,equals forty-three plus two m,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:53:39.600000,00:53:41.800000,I'll subtract the forty-three again,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:53:41.800000,00:53:52.300000,and then we get w sixty-eight sixty-eight minus forty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,6,00:53:53.200000,00:53:57.800000,it should be twenty-eight equals two m (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,1,T2 ,,,1,00:53:58.200000,00:54:06.500000,now divided by two to get m equals fourteen,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,

3,2,S1 ,,,6,00:05:08.400000,00:05:10.800000,so we need to figure that out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,6,00:05:15.100000,00:05:17.200000,,so it was just warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,6,00:05:17.200000,00:05:18.600000,,and then it's not even warm again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,2,S1 ,,,6,00:05:36.400000,00:05:40.200000,,yeah the only thing I really like about winter is when it actually snows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,6,00:05:40.200000,00:05:42,,and then it barely even snowed this winter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,6,00:05:42,00:05:42.500000,,so I'm done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,7,00:05:42.500000,00:05:47,I know it was just sort of like annoying like enough that you had to shovel it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,S1 ,,,7,00:05:47.100000,00:05:49.400000,but you didn't get any days off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,2,S1 ,,,7,00:05:50.600000,00:05:54.200000,I actually got like one day off this entire winter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,7,00:05:54.200000,00:05:54.600000,,yeah me too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,7,00:05:55.400000,00:05:57.900000,yeah but it was like not even cold out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,7,00:05:58.500000,00:06:01.700000,,and I only got like two-hour delays probably,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,7,00:06:01.700000,00:06:04.200000,yeah we didn't get yeah the same for us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,7,00:06:04.200000,00:06:08.600000,it is like winter wasn't even here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,7,00:06:09.200000,00:06:09.500000,,yeah (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:09.600000,00:06:15.300000,,I don't know if they go to your school or not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:15.300000,00:06:18.900000,,but a couple of my friends are at Squirrel Hill and then pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:19,00:06:20.800000,,do you know Sophia Doyna or Trisha Soreta,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,QE,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:20.800000,00:06:21.100000,I (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:21.600000,00:06:26.300000,,okay because I think they go to Falk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:26.300000,00:06:28.100000,,never mind (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,4,00:06:29.100000,00:06:29.700000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:38.600000,00:06:48.200000,,so what made you decide to do the CMU thing,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,QE,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:48.700000,00:06:53.100000,oh well I guess pause filler my mom works here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,IDS
3,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:53.100000,00:06:54.300000,so she noticed it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:54.400000,00:06:57.900000,and yeah I decided I'd do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:58.100000,00:06:58.300000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:58.600000,00:06:59,so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,2,00:06:59.300000,00:07:02.900000,,it's not too long you get money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,2,00:07:03.500000,00:07:04.700000,yeah money is nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,2,00:07:05,00:07:07.200000,,yeah but it's a good experience also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,2,00:07:08.300000,00:07:08.700000,yeah (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:16.400000,00:07:17.500000,,thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:17.500000,00:07:18.900000,I have a question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:18.900000,00:07:24.300000,is there a way to turn this down a little bit,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:24.300000,00:07:25.200000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,S1 ,,,5,00:07:25.200000,00:07:26.300000,(inaudible) all right thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:08:05.800000,00:28:25.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,1,1.0,5,00:08:07.800000,00:11:04.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:08.600000,00:08:09.200000,pause filler okay (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:09.900000,00:08:12.600000,,so do you know how to do this,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:12.600000,00:08:14,,you've learned this in school right,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:14.200000,00:08:18.800000,yeah so okay so yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:18.800000,00:08:21.900000,the first thing is you want to get x alone,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:21.900000,00:08:25.100000,you want to get rid of those the three over seven pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:26.300000,00:08:35.400000,,yes so then you would have to well on the sheet it was like saying that you would have to do seven x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:35.400000,00:08:36.900000,,but I guess that's not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:37.500000,00:08:38.300000,,well never mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:39.100000,00:08:41.900000,yeah so there's like two ways to do this,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:42,00:08:45.500000,you could either divide x plus three over seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:45.500000,00:08:48.400000,or you could multiply it plus three over seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:49.600000,00:08:52.300000,,yes so you would have to divide it by three sevens,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:53.200000,00:08:56.500000,yeah or we could multiply it by the reciprocal,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:57.100000,00:08:58.200000,because that would also work,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:58.200000,00:08:59.800000,because that would turn it into one,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:00.500000,00:09:01.300000,,yeah yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:02,00:09:03.400000,,so what do you think,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:03.400000,00:09:04.100000,,what do you,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:05.100000,00:09:08.900000,pause filler I mean it all depends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:09,00:09:11.800000,would you rather divide forty or,,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:11.800000,00:09:13.600000,would you rather multiply over forty,,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:13.600000,00:09:17.800000,probably multiplying might be easier than dividing forty,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:17.900000,00:09:20.800000,,all right then teach me how to do that then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:22.500000,00:09:27.500000,okay okay that's weird oh okay yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:27.500000,00:09:30,so you would want to do is,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:30,00:09:34.700000,you would want to just put like forty over here,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:35.700000,00:09:38.900000,so that works,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:38.900000,00:09:44.600000,so you I guess you would want to write out forty if you're going to multiply that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:44.900000,00:09:49.500000,,all right so then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:49.500000,00:09:58,so then pause filler if we're going to multiply it pause filler you're going to just write over here three over seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:58,00:10:00,or seven over three yeah,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:00,00:10:01.400000,and you want to do a reciprocal,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:01.500000,00:10:01.900000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:03.700000,00:10:06.200000,and I assume you know how to multiply fractions right,,,CU,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:06.800000,00:10:09.900000,,I actually haven't learned this for like a year or two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,2,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:09.900000,00:10:12.600000,,so just refresh me on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:10:12.700000,00:10:16.200000,,I kind of remember but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:10:16.400000,00:10:19.500000,so pause filler basically it's like multiplying normally except,,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:10:19.600000,00:10:25.600000,you want to multiply the forty times seven and the one times three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:10:26.100000,00:10:28.400000,,okay okay yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:10:28.400000,00:10:30.600000,you just multiply straight across so you get,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:10:31.200000,00:10:32.200000,,two hundred eighty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:10:32.800000,00:10:33.200000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:10:36.700000,00:10:40.300000,,over three right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:10:40.300000,00:10:43.700000,,and then does that pause filler does that simplify,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:10:40.400000,00:10:41.100000,yea,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:10:44.700000,00:10:45.400000,pause filler no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:10:46.100000,00:10:47.500000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:10:46.800000,00:10:47.200000,no,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:10:47.500000,00:10:51.700000,see pause filler I guess you could just say that,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:10:52.600000,00:10:58.700000,because it would be okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:10:58.700000,00:11:04.300000,because you know you probably know (inaudible) okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:11:04.300000,00:11:05.600000,,all right next up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,2,1.0,4,00:11:04.400000,00:11:37.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:11:05.600000,00:11:09.900000,,so now do you want to multiply from the reciprocal again,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:11:10.100000,00:11:11.100000,,so fourteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:11:11.500000,00:11:11.900000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:11:13.600000,00:11:18.200000,,time eight over three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:11:19.800000,00:11:22.900000,,and then that's over one so fourteen times eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:11:24.200000,00:11:25.900000,,oh gosh what is fourteen times eight,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:11:26.300000,00:11:28.900000,see pause filler seven time eight is fifty-six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:11:28.900000,00:11:31.900000,fifty-six times two a hundred and twelve,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:11:32.400000,00:11:34.200000,,all right thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:11:34.900000,00:11:36.900000,,over three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:11:37.600000,00:13:34.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:11:37.600000,00:11:38,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:11:38,00:11:40.300000,,all right so next up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:11:42.300000,00:11:43.700000,,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:11:45.900000,00:11:51.600000,okay yeah for this one this one you just have you're adding an extra step to it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:11:51.600000,00:11:55.100000,so the first thing want to do is make sure y is alone on this,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:11:56.400000,00:12:03.900000,,all right so you're adding eighteen to both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:12:04.800000,00:12:09.400000,,so that will equal seventy right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:12:09.600000,00:12:09.800000,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:12:11.500000,00:12:23.300000,,so seventy negative two thirds y sorry my writing is so messy equals seventy,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,SV,IDA,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:12:25.200000,00:12:36.100000,,so you want to do seventy times wait three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:12:36.200000,00:12:37.800000,yeah you wanted to make sure there's a three,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:12:37.800000,00:12:49,,yeah wait let me go back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:12:50.400000,00:12:53.400000,okay you want to just multiply,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:12:53.400000,00:13:03.900000,,seven times two equals (inaudible),,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:13:07.500000,00:13:13.700000,,and then that would equal to one hundred five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:13:14,00:13:16.900000,yeah maybe you could probably just put a y equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:13:17.500000,00:13:24.400000,,yeah so finally it's our y equals one hundred,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:13:24.600000,00:13:27,except one thing you forgot to do is,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:13:27,00:13:31.700000,I'm pretty sure the one o five would be a negative because yeah,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:13:32.300000,00:13:34.900000,you know y was a negative so,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:13:34.900000,00:13:39.800000,,all right next up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,4,1.0,5,00:13:35,00:14:30.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:13:41.500000,00:13:46.300000,,all right so same thing here,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:13:46.900000,00:13:47.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:13:47.300000,00:13:54,,so you would want to do minus thirteen on both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:13:54.700000,00:14:06.400000,,and that would equal one x equals thirty-one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:14:07.500000,00:14:15.200000,,then thirty-one over three times two over one equals sixty-two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:14:15.600000,00:14:15.900000,yep,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:14:18.900000,00:14:24.300000,,so would it be x equals sixty-two then,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:14:24.300000,00:14:25.600000,yeah as you said,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:14:26.100000,00:14:30.500000,because you can't really do you could divide it by one but that would still be a sixty-two,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:14:30.500000,00:14:39.300000,,yeah okay so this is a little bit different because it's like on the other side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,5,1.0,0,00:14:30.600000,00:16:13.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:14:39.300000,00:14:41.500000,,but it's still the same so,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:14:41.700000,00:14:42.200000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:14:42.200000,00:14:52.600000,,add sixteen to both sides so then you I'm just going to flip this around so three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:14:54.200000,00:15:00,,actually I'm just going to go six over three equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:15:00,00:15:05.300000,,my gosh it's not even showing up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:15:06.200000,00:15:06.900000,it's not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:15:07.400000,00:15:08.300000,,wait one second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:15:09.200000,00:15:10.900000,,this tip like lagging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:15:11.800000,00:15:12.200000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:15:14.300000,00:15:18.300000,,forty-seven over pause filler,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:15:19.600000,00:15:22.900000,,so then oh gosh what's six times forty-seven,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:15:22.900000,00:15:25.600000,pause filler well one thing you could do let's see wait (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:15:25.600000,00:15:36,I guess before you do that you maybe you could simplify pause filler the sixty over three to like two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS
3,2,T1 ,,,4,00:15:36.500000,00:15:37.400000,that might help you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:15:37.400000,00:15:49,,oh yeah so three over one so forty-seven time two equals pause filler fifty-four right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:15:50.400000,00:16:00.600000,well not times two forty-seven would be eighty but mostly fourteen ninety-four because it wouldn't,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:16:00.600000,00:16:07.300000,,yeah so ninety-four and then pause filler,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:16:07.300000,00:16:11.500000,,that would be over that would just be ninety-four,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:16:11.500000,00:16:13.600000,,so x equals ninety-four,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:16:18.400000,00:16:20.300000,,I haven't done the reciprocal for a long time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:16:20.300000,00:16:23.500000,,so that's why I'm just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:16:24.900000,00:16:25.500000,it is fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
3,2,T1 ,6,0.0,6,00:16:25.400000,00:18:39.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:16:25.500000,00:16:27.200000,,so big numbers now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:16:27.300000,00:16:28.500000,,minus,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:16:30.700000,00:16:31,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:16:31.400000,00:16:32.600000,,forty-eight so,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:16:32.600000,00:16:43,yeah so you want to subtract,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:16:43,00:16:46.800000,,would that be forty-nine,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:16:47.200000,00:16:47.600000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:16:47.600000,00:16:48.700000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:16:51.200000,00:17:00.900000,,all right so so that would be five over twelve there,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:17:00.900000,00:17:01.900000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:17:02.200000,00:17:04.800000,,here I'm just going to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:17:13.500000,00:17:14.100000,yeah okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:17:14.100000,00:17:16.500000,and that would be a y right (inaudible),,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:17:16.500000,00:17:22.500000,,all right so forty-nine times five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:17:22.500000,00:17:25.100000,,I wish there was a calculator gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:17:25.200000,00:17:25.800000,I know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:17:26.900000,00:17:37.600000,,so nine times five equals pause filler forty-five sorry forty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:17:38.900000,00:17:39.400000,forty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:17:39.400000,00:17:42.600000,and that equals to a hundred well,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:17:44.400000,00:17:46.200000,,one hundred sixty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:17:47.300000,00:17:48.800000,no wait that wait,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:17:49,00:17:50.900000,forty-five does a hundred and forty-five,,,,,OSQ,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:17:51,00:17:56.400000,because forty times five equals two hundred so,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:17:56.400000,00:18:03.500000,,are you sure it's not a hundred sixty-five,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:18:03.500000,00:18:05,wait maybe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:18:05,00:18:08.100000,oh wait yeah it's forty-nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:08.500000,00:18:13.200000,yeah forty-nine times five equals five okay,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:14.500000,00:18:18.300000,that's like okay so that's your five right pause filler,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:19.200000,00:18:20.700000,so you have four over pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:22.100000,00:18:30.200000,then as you go like that because you have to have zero there,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:30.200000,00:18:31.700000,and that's yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:31.700000,00:18:39.900000,so it would be two hundred forty-five and pause filler five (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:39.900000,00:18:42.100000,,all right next page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,7,1.0,7,00:18:39.900000,00:23:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:18:42.500000,00:18:44,,oh gosh all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:18:44.100000,00:18:50.300000,,so this one is going to be plus sixty-one to both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:18:50.500000,00:18:50.700000,yup,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:18:50.700000,00:18:57,,and then you also want to add the two ys y thing right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:18:57.200000,00:18:58.400000,,because that's like (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:18:58.400000,00:18:59.300000,yeah so yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:18:59.300000,00:19:04.500000,because there is two ones I really want one,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:19:04.500000,00:19:07,,what just happened,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:19:07,00:19:07.500000,wait a minute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:07.500000,00:19:16.300000,so would you really want to so wait which side would you want to have your y on before you do this,,,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:18.100000,00:19:20.500000,,pause filler I guess this side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:20.500000,00:19:22.100000,,like this side over here,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:23.300000,00:19:26.300000,oh so for that you'd have to subtract the y pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:26.800000,00:19:31.600000,no so that would be harder than adding the y over here,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:31.600000,00:19:36.300000,because I guess if you add it over here then you would get pause filler,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:36.300000,00:19:36.500000,oh wait (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:36.700000,00:19:37.300000,huh huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:38.200000,00:19:46.200000,I guess it doesn't make a difference,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:46.200000,00:19:51.700000,but the y would be you'd have the negative y if you do it this way,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:51.700000,00:19:54.600000,or you have a positive y if you did it that way,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:55.300000,00:19:57.700000,so that yeah it doesn't matter that much,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:57.900000,00:19:59,so I guess yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:00,00:20:03.600000,,just work through the first step really quick because I'm confused just,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:03.600000,00:20:04.200000,,I'm sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:05,00:20:07.100000,yeah pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:07.200000,00:20:14.200000,yeah not subtracting sixty-one I mean this one is like a smaller one so I mean,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:14.200000,00:20:19.500000,usually we'll do the one that was smaller but it doesn't matter exactly,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:22.400000,00:20:23.900000,,well this one is smaller right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:23.900000,00:20:24.700000,,oh yeah so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:24.700000,00:20:30.400000,I mean when I add the sixty-five just sixty-one yeah,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:32.200000,00:20:34,,all right so twenty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:39,00:20:39.900000,eight-six,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:20:40,00:20:40.300000,,yeah,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:20:54.700000,00:20:55.300000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:20:55.700000,00:20:57.200000,,oh wait no that's equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:20:57.600000,00:20:58.800000,,oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:20:59.400000,00:21:00,,I'll just,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,0,00:21:00.400000,00:21:06.600000,,and then pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:21:10,00:21:21.500000,,so then you would sub you would oh so how do you add this then,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:21:21.500000,00:21:22.200000,,because it's like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:21:23,00:21:23.500000,oh wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:21:23.500000,00:21:28.100000,so you want to get rid of the wait so now you want to subtract the y right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:21:28.100000,00:21:30,because you only have y on one side,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:21:30.500000,00:21:32.900000,and so if you got rid of that y,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:21:32.900000,00:21:36.200000,then you would have like a zero so,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:21:36.900000,00:21:43.900000,,so would that be negative six over six y then,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:21:43.900000,00:21:44,pause filler six,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:21:44,00:21:44.300000,wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:21:45.200000,00:21:53.100000,,like what is going to get six over seven minus one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:21:53.100000,00:21:54.800000,,because y is one basically,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:21:55.400000,00:22:08.900000,well so when you're subtracting that y the y pause filler is really just can be pause filler a negative seven over seven y right,,,,,CA,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,1,00:22:08.900000,00:22:19.500000,so then it would just be a negative thirteen over seven y when you subtract them together,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,1,00:22:20.400000,00:22:24.300000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,1,00:22:24.300000,00:22:24.400000,,so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,1,00:22:28.900000,00:22:31.100000,so then once you have that y,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:22:38.500000,00:22:45.600000,you have that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:22:45.600000,00:22:51.500000,and then you just want to multiply it by seven over thirteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:22:51.500000,00:22:53.400000,mm-hmm that's lovely,,,,,,,,,,,,,LPP,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:22:54.500000,00:22:58.100000,,so what's eighty-six times seven,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:22:58.200000,00:23:01.100000,pause filler I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:23:01.400000,00:23:07.200000,okay (inaudible) okay eight six times seven two two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:23:07.200000,00:23:18.200000,and for the four (inaudible) six fifty-six plus four sixty-eight pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:23:18.200000,00:23:22.500000,maybe six hundred and two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:23:22.500000,00:23:37.700000,,all right that's so close so six hundred two and then pause filler that is over negative thirteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:23:39.500000,00:23:40.500000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,7,00:23:40.500000,00:23:49.600000,,like I'm just going to go with that you know (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,2,T1 ,,,7,00:23:50.500000,00:23:52.500000,put a little negative sign then,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,7,00:23:53.200000,00:23:55,there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,7,00:23:55,00:23:59,,all right let's move onto the next one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,8,0.0,6,00:23:55.200000,00:28:25.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,7,00:23:59,00:24:07.900000,,all right so let's just start off by adding a two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:20,00:24:23.700000,,so this cancels out then it,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:29.200000,00:24:30.800000,and then you just have,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:30.800000,00:24:35.300000,,one hundred yeah (laughter) so,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:33.400000,00:24:33.800000,yep,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:36.400000,00:24:37,you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:38.100000,00:24:41.900000,,plus ten over third x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:24:41.900000,00:24:45.800000,,and then negative eleven x is left over on the other side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:24:46.400000,00:24:52.900000,,so now you want to add eleven x right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:24:53.100000,00:24:59.900000,,so then would that be if you're adding eleven x would that be,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:24:59.900000,00:25:09.300000,pause filler wait if you're adding wait if you're adding elevenx,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:25:09.700000,00:25:13.700000,,would that be eleven and then ten over three,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:25:14.800000,00:25:23.500000,okay if you're going to do that then on the other side you have zero equals scribble,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:25:24.600000,00:25:32.400000,so then you only want you want to have x on one side and the hundred on the other,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:25:32.800000,00:25:36.400000,so you don't want to do that,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:25:36.400000,00:25:40.800000,you would either have to pause filler put the hundred on the other side or,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:40.800000,00:25:44.200000,you would have to subtract your ten x (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:44.900000,00:25:51.400000,do you get that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:53.200000,00:25:54.200000,,all right so pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:54.200000,00:26:02,so which one would you rather do,,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:26:02.100000,00:26:05.200000,so you could either subtract a hundred,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:26:05.700000,00:26:08,or you could subtract ten x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,1,00:26:10,00:26:14.500000,the ten x will probably have less steps in here because you already put a hundred on one side,,,,,,,ER,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,1,00:26:14.500000,00:26:18,,all right so subtract ten x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,1,00:26:21.300000,00:26:39,,so that would be negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,1,00:26:40.900000,00:26:42.700000,wait wait pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:26:44.100000,00:26:48.800000,it doesn't look right,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:26:49.300000,00:26:50.400000,,three x or three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:26:52.600000,00:27:01.200000,well you pause filler wait one second sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:27:01.600000,00:27:03.500000,,it's okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:27:03.500000,00:27:04,wait a minute pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:27:05,00:27:08.900000,I'm sorry I like zoned out for a couple second wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDA/IDQ
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:27:08.900000,00:27:12.400000,so you added the eleven x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:27:12.400000,00:27:15.400000,is that what you ended up doing,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:27:19.100000,00:27:26.800000,,pause filler I well then you say that you could subtract ten x from both sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:27:26.800000,00:27:28.200000,yeah so is that what you did,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:27:28.400000,00:27:28.800000,,yeah so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:27:28.800000,00:27:28.900000,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:27:28.900000,00:27:34.100000,,so negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:27:34.100000,00:27:34.600000,no no no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:27:34.600000,00:27:39.100000,so your question is would it be a negative twenty-one x,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:27:39.800000,00:27:41.900000,because you still have to divide it by three,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,5,00:27:41.900000,00:27:42.800000,so I'm pretty sure it won't,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:27:43.100000,00:27:45.400000,but yeah I'm getting confused,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:27:45.700000,00:27:48.100000,wait no wait no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:27:48.100000,00:27:56.400000,you can't do that yeah because pause filler yeah you can't put the divided by three thing underneath that because that wouldn't work,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:27:58,00:28:01.500000,so ten over three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:28:02.600000,00:28:03.800000,,so you would have to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,3,00:28:03.800000,00:28:12.500000,so your negative eleven x because negative eleven is like over one and,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:28:12.600000,00:28:15.100000,,wouldn't you multiply it by three x probably,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:28:16.600000,00:28:22.300000,well you're not trying to get rid well you're trying to get rid on that side by subtraction not multiplication,,,,,,,EV,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:28:23.800000,00:28:25.100000,so what you can do,,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:28:26.400000,00:28:29.700000,,It's going good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,6,00:28:33,00:28:33.500000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:28:49,00:28:49.300000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T1 ,,,2,00:28:50.800000,00:28:51.200000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:39.400000,00:36:41.900000,,where did the pen go,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:42.100000,00:36:42.900000,,what the heck,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:44.800000,00:36:48.700000,is your thing set up as one over x equals twenty-five,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:49.300000,00:36:49.500000,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:50.600000,00:36:50.700000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:50.700000,00:36:52.600000,,oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:52.600000,00:36:53.600000,,where did the pen go,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:56.200000,00:37:19.900000,,I swear I'm going insane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:25,00:37:30.800000,,one second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:37.500000,00:37:44.600000,did you find it,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:45.200000,00:37:45.800000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:46.200000,00:37:48.900000,what was it,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:48.900000,00:37:50.200000,,he had the pen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:50.200000,00:37:54,,he certainly grabbed it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,1,1.0,0,00:37:54.500000,00:39:43.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:54.900000,00:38:01.400000,,all right so now do you know how to do this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:38:01.400000,00:38:04.600000,,we're going to start off by multiplying by x on both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,Na,00:38:05.500000,00:38:12.500000,okay so you multiply it by x on the (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:38:12.500000,00:38:16.700000,,well actually never mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:38:17.200000,00:38:18,,that was wrong,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:38:18,00:38:23,,wait I'm looking at the tutor worksheet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:38:33.200000,00:38:35.700000,,yeah you do multiply both sides by x okay,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:38:35.700000,00:38:41.500000,okay so and so you multiply that by x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:38:42.400000,00:38:46.700000,then you get one x over x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:38:46.800000,00:38:48.100000,so that could be one,,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:38:48.100000,00:38:51.100000,,oh yeah that would just be one no x on this side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:38:51.100000,00:38:52.900000,,after you multiply on this side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:38:52.900000,00:38:54.100000,,after you multiply it by x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:38:54.100000,00:38:56.700000,,it pause filler it cancels out the x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:38:56.700000,00:38:59.200000,,so then that would be twenty-five x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:38:59.800000,00:39:06.400000,yeah so then you divide it by twenty-five on both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:39:07.200000,00:39:07.600000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,0,00:39:15.300000,00:39:21.400000,okay so then you have x equals one over twenty-five,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,0,00:39:25.800000,00:39:43.700000,,all right oh you all right okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:39:43.700000,00:40:57.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,0,00:39:43.700000,00:39:47.700000,,so you want to start off by adding seventeen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,0,00:39:47.700000,00:39:48.800000,,now what do you do next,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,0,00:39:48.800000,00:39:51.300000,,you add a number to the sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,0,00:39:51.300000,00:39:53.800000,okay pause filler okay yeah it makes sense,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,0,00:39:53.800000,00:39:55.900000,so you just add the seventeen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,0,00:39:59.700000,00:40:02.500000,and then you would get eighty,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,0,00:40:02.500000,00:40:06.800000,,yeah so negative three over y equals eighty,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:40:11.900000,00:40:14.800000,,now you want to multiply it by y on both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:40:15,00:40:24.600000,okay so one pause filler negative three equals eighty-y,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:40:25.700000,00:40:30.700000,this you would want to divide it by y,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:40:30.700000,00:40:36.700000,no you would want to divide it by,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:40:36.700000,00:40:38.100000,no you would want to divide by,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:40:38.100000,00:40:38.500000,,eighty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:40:38.900000,00:40:39.400000,eighty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:40:39.600000,00:40:52.800000,so then you would get y equals negative three over eighty,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:40:53.100000,00:40:57.600000,that must be okay that was this is beautiful okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,4,1.0,3,00:40:57.600000,00:42:08.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:40:57.600000,00:40:59.400000,okay next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:02.200000,00:41:09.800000,,all right so two hundred ten equals negative fourteen over y,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:09.800000,00:41:12.900000,,what do you think your first step is going to be,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:12.900000,00:41:15.700000,pause filler so you multiply it by y yeah,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:15.700000,00:41:19.700000,,so that cancels that out on this side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:19.800000,00:41:22.200000,,and then you can equal two hundred ten,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:22.200000,00:41:24,so you got negative yes,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:24,00:41:32.900000,and then you get two hundred and ten y equals negative fourteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:41:33.100000,00:41:43.400000,okay so after you do that you pause filler want to divide everything by twenty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:41:43.400000,00:41:52.500000,,yeah so you're left with y on one side,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:41:54.400000,00:41:59.500000,,because the two hundred ten is canceled out,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:41:59.700000,00:42:07.200000,mm-hmm and (inaudible) you're both uh-huh with seven (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:42:07.700000,00:42:09,that looks good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:42:09,00:42:16.600000,okay so because this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,5,1.0,5,00:42:09,00:43:30.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:42:16.600000,00:42:25.300000,,you want to start off by adding twenty-four to both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:42:25.300000,00:42:40.600000,and then oh one hundred thirty-seven equals five over x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:42:40.600000,00:42:50.300000,and then like the other ones you would want to multiply it by x,,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:42:50.700000,00:42:51.200000,,correct,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:42:54.400000,00:43:10.600000,and one hundred thirty-seven x equals five divided by hundred thirty-seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:43:11.300000,00:43:11.700000,,perfect,,,,,,,CF,,,,UL,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:11.800000,00:43:26.400000,yup x equals pause filler one hundred thirty-seven yeah,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:26.400000,00:43:28.500000,,you got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:29.200000,00:43:30.100000,yeah okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:30.200000,00:43:32.800000,next one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,6,1.0,3,00:43:30.300000,00:45:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:32.800000,00:43:33.400000,,yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:35.400000,00:43:35.600000,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:36.600000,00:43:42.500000,,all right oh so this is different,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:43:42.500000,00:43:43.100000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:43:43.100000,00:43:46.500000,,so you negative thirty-nine is smaller,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:43:46.500000,00:43:56.600000,,so you probably want to start off by adding thirty-nine to both sides,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:43:56.800000,00:43:57.800000,pause filler well yeah it makes sense,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:44:04.900000,00:44:10.600000,,so remember that seventeen over x and twelve over x are like terms,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:44:11,00:44:17.500000,,so you probably want to subtract twelve x from both sides,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:44:18.400000,00:44:20.700000,yeah okay one second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:44:20.700000,00:44:22.300000,let me just get this up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:44:22.300000,00:44:27.500000,equals twelve x or soon not to be twelve x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:44:27.600000,00:44:33.500000,oh it's twenty-one (inaudible) eighteen eighteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:44:34,00:44:45.700000,we can subtract that to get pause filler five over x equals eighteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:44:46,00:44:46.900000,,all right yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:44:46.900000,00:44:56.300000,multiply it by x to get five pause filler equals eighteen x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:44:56.300000,00:45:04.900000,and we can divide by eighteen to get on with over here pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:45:06.500000,00:45:10.800000,five over eighteen equals x,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:45:10.900000,00:45:16.600000,that's so sloppy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:45:16.700000,00:45:17.200000,and x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:45:17.200000,00:45:25.800000,,all right so this one is very similar,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,7,1.0,1,00:45:17.200000,00:49:58.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:45:25.800000,00:45:28.900000,,so negative nine and two are smaller,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:45:28.900000,00:45:31.900000,,so what would you do with that,AH,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:45:31.900000,00:45:38.100000,pause filler so you would want to you want to add it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:45:38.400000,00:45:45.100000,and you get plus another ninety-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:45:45.100000,00:46:00.500000,okay pause filler then you have three x equals pause filler a hundred and three plus twelve x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:46:00.800000,00:46:04,and then you want to subtract with twelve x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:46:04.300000,00:46:06.100000,get rid of that until (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:46:06.100000,00:46:08.300000,,well twelve over x remember,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:46:08.800000,00:46:09.800000,oh yeah (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:46:10.100000,00:46:13,,but it's okay you still subtract,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:46:13.200000,00:46:13.500000,here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:46:13.500000,00:46:18.500000,,but you should subtract pause filler three x right three over x first,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:46:19.300000,00:46:20.800000,you did that one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:46:20.800000,00:46:26.900000,it could be a zero equals a hundred three plus fifteen x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:46:26.900000,00:46:33.900000,,no because if you're subtracting pause filler three over x on from twelve,,,,,EV,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:46:34.300000,00:46:40.300000,,then it would be pause filler nine over x like one hundred three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:46:40.300000,00:46:44.500000,pause filler yeah one second yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:46:44.800000,00:46:47.500000,,oh well actually right you're right sorry,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:46:47.500000,00:46:48.400000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:46:48.400000,00:46:49.600000,,so you would subtract twelve x,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:46:49.600000,00:46:52.900000,,because three x is on the other equal side of the,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:46:52.900000,00:46:58.900000,okay so minus twelve x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:46:58.900000,00:47:07.100000,yeah that's a beautiful x (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,LPP,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:47:07.300000,00:47:14.500000,so then you know being negative nine yeah negative yeah twelve over x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:47:14.500000,00:47:21.100000,and we got negative nine x equals a hundred and three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:47:24.600000,00:47:27.800000,that makes sense,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:47:27.800000,00:47:29.200000,okay and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:47:29.200000,00:47:42.300000,,you divide by well you said you multiply I mean,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:47:43.100000,00:47:57.300000,I guess you could divide right pause filler maybe,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:47:57.300000,00:48:04.700000,I think you could divide but pause filler multiply okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:48:05.900000,00:48:10.100000,x wait no nine equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:48:10.100000,00:48:12.400000,,how do you get your screen to go lower,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:48:12.400000,00:48:14.200000,,because I can't see what you're doing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:48:14.200000,00:48:15.700000,pause filler you can't pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:48:15.700000,00:48:22.200000,see how far can you see to what I'm doing,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:48:24,00:48:25.300000,,I can see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:48:25.600000,00:48:29.200000,here I'm going to write a bunch of numbers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:48:29.200000,00:48:30.600000,tell me which ones you can see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:48:30.600000,00:48:32,can you see any of those,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:48:32.400000,00:48:34.100000,,I can see one two three and four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:48:34.500000,00:48:36.800000,okay so you can't see five and six pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:48:36.800000,00:48:42.600000,okay now I'll get rid of those pause filler okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:48:44,00:48:51.500000,huh is your pause filler scribbler screen like fully like,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:48:51.500000,00:48:55.100000,is it from like one end to the screen all the way up to the other,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:48:56.400000,00:49:01.600000,,well it is now because I've just made it bigger but it's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:49:01.600000,00:49:05.800000,can you see nine equals one hundred threex,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:49:05.900000,00:49:12.100000,,pause filler yes I wait it's okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:12.100000,00:49:13,,just keep working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:13,00:49:14.600000,,I can fix it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:16.600000,00:49:17.300000,,just keep working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:17.300000,00:49:17.700000,,it's okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:18.300000,00:49:23.600000,pause filler ops one second I think pause filler oh actually a way to scroll down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:23.600000,00:49:28.100000,you can just probably use a scroll button pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:28.100000,00:49:30.200000,no that one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:30.200000,00:49:31.400000,like okay yeah okay pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:31.400000,00:49:33,I'll just try and go with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:34.100000,00:49:42.400000,so then I go pause filler one hundred and three x oh (laughter) pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:49:42.800000,00:49:45.100000,yes you divide a hundred and three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:49:45.100000,00:49:52.400000,so you got nine over a hundred and three equals x,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:49:53,00:49:57.400000,there we go okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,8,1.0,2,00:49:58.800000,00:53:14.300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:49:58.900000,00:50:01.300000,and next one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:50:02.800000,00:50:06.200000,,all right so twenty-five is smaller,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:50:06.200000,00:50:23.400000,,so you want to start up by subtracting that from both sides right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,1,00:50:11,00:50:11.200000,yea,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:50:23.500000,00:50:23.700000,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:50:23.800000,00:50:24.200000,come on (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:50:24.200000,00:50:29.500000,that's sort of like I just want to know what that looks like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:50:29.900000,00:50:46.400000,then got one over x no wait and then that will be plus thirty-five equals nine over x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:50:49.700000,00:50:53.800000,and then since you have that already,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:50:54.200000,00:50:58,you want to get rid of the one over x,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:50:58.300000,00:51:00.400000,and it's just the bottoms all (inaudible) is,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:00.400000,00:51:01.700000,you can just subtract that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:01.700000,00:51:04.100000,,yes so you subtract one over x on both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:04.500000,00:51:05.800000,,and then you would end up with,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:06.800000,00:51:09.700000,thirty-five equals eight overx,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:51:10,00:51:20.200000,,so then you would want to multiply it by x on both sides to cancel out the x on this side,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:51:20.200000,00:51:24.400000,well I was thinking pause filler since pause filler since the wait,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:51:24.700000,00:51:27,you could try dividing by eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:51:27,00:51:29.600000,do you think that would work,,,,,HR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:51:30,00:51:37.200000,,well on my tutor sheet it doesn't say anything about dividing by eight so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:51:38.400000,00:51:44,,I think you would just I think that it would just pause filler give you extra steps that you don't plan,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:51:44.300000,00:51:52,well maybe well I guess if you multiply if you divide it by eight when you just have x right x by itself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:51:53.400000,00:51:55.800000,,no because it's dividing anyway,,,,,EV,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:51:55.800000,00:51:58,,like eight it is divided by x anyway so pause filler,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:51:58.700000,00:52:01,,you would have to multiply it or something,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:52:01.100000,00:52:02.500000,,but it just it's pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:52:05.500000,00:52:06.500000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:52:06.600000,00:52:12.700000,,it would be too complicated I guess,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:52:12.700000,00:52:18.900000,,on all of the things it says to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:52:20.600000,00:52:20.800000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:52:21,00:52:26.500000,wait so then you get thirty-five x equals eight,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:52:26.500000,00:52:30.200000,or so we just divide it by thirty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:52:30.200000,00:52:40.600000,and you get x equals like could you see that stuff on the bottom I was doing,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:52:40.600000,00:52:41.200000,,pause filler no I couldn't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:52:41.200000,00:52:43.800000,,but I can see what you're doing right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:52:43.800000,00:52:49.400000,okay x equals eight over thirty-five pause filler,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:52:49.500000,00:52:57.200000,but on this problem could you just draw a line at the bottom of the page that where you can see,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:52:57.200000,00:52:57.900000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:53:01.100000,00:53:03.200000,okay that way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:53:03.200000,00:53:04.100000,,all right wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:53:04.300000,00:53:08.400000,okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:53:08.900000,00:53:14.200000,okay so you can see all the stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,9,1.0,5,00:53:15,00:56:04.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:53:15.500000,00:53:21.700000,,all right so you're going to start off by subtracting twenty-two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:53:22.400000,00:53:29.700000,and then you get a hundred and three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:53:31.100000,00:53:31.300000,,yup,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:53:31.800000,00:53:36.600000,plus ten x and then ninex,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:53:36.600000,00:53:37.300000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:53:37.300000,00:53:45,and then pause filler yeah you're going to get rid of the tenx,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:53:45.100000,00:53:48.800000,,so you probably want to subtract,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,3,00:53:48.800000,00:54:10.200000,yeah so then you get a hundred three equals pause filler negative onex,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:54:10.200000,00:54:32.400000,,all right so then you want to multiply,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:54:32.400000,00:54:34.800000,I was just trying something out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:54:34.800000,00:54:38.600000,because if you multiply that by negative one x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:54:41.300000,00:54:48.700000,and then it would be negative one right over negative one x right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:54:51,00:54:55.100000,and then you could cancel out the negative one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:54:55.900000,00:54:59.600000,,well if you see look at number nine on here,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:55:00.600000,00:55:03.100000,,this is like a really similar problem,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:55:03.100000,00:55:05,,and you can kind of see what they're doing,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:55:05.500000,00:55:09.500000,,it's not really like,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:55:09.500000,00:55:12.500000,oh yes I mean it just seems like you would get rid of the step,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:12.500000,00:55:15.100000,but really it's just do those stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:15.400000,00:55:18.800000,so you want to multiply by the x hundred and three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:18.800000,00:55:22.600000,and you get x equals one over (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:23.700000,00:55:24.500000,wait okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:24.800000,00:55:38.400000,,well you still have to divide it by negative one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:41,00:55:45.400000,,so you multiply that on both sides and then pause filler,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:49.100000,00:55:50.500000,yeah actually you divide it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:50.500000,00:55:54.200000,then the step would be on the other side to just divide,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:54.300000,00:55:55.400000,you get x by itself,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:55.400000,00:55:57.600000,and you have to divide negative three by negative one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:58.600000,00:55:59.800000,,okay all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:55:59.800000,00:56:02.500000,pause filler but is that the same thing,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:56:02.500000,00:56:03.300000,I don't think so pause filler,,,,,,,,,IF,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:56:03.300000,00:56:03.800000,,I doubt it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,5,00:56:03.800000,00:56:04.100000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,10,2.0,4,00:56:04.400000,00:56:38.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:56:04.500000,00:56:14,,all right so let's pause filler one ninety,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:56:15.400000,00:56:25.800000,,what's ninety what's one ninety there we go yeah,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:56:25.800000,00:56:30.700000,,and then I would want to yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:56:30.800000,00:56:32.900000,,oh this is a big number pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,4,00:56:32.900000,00:56:40.300000,,so you got negative five over x equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:56:46.300000,00:56:46.800000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:56:49.100000,00:56:50,it's like really tiny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:56:50.800000,00:56:52.700000,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:56:52.800000,00:56:57.200000,I don't know what happened to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:57:04.800000,00:57:06,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,6,00:57:10.600000,00:57:11.200000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:57:15.600000,00:57:15.700000,bye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:57:15.700000,00:57:18,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:57:18.400000,00:57:18.700000,okay bye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:57:18.700000,00:57:19,,bye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2,T2 ,,,2,00:57:19,00:57:19.300000,bye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,S1 ,,,0,00:00:40.200000,00:08:16.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,S1 ,,,2,00:02:47.600000,00:02:49.400000,what,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:07:53.300000,00:07:55.600000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:08:01.600000,00:08:02.900000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,S1 ,,,0,00:08:19,00:08:20,(inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:10:05.900000,00:10:07.600000,so there's one on every page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:10:08.300000,00:10:11.700000,so I just go to there to go to the next problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,S1 ,,,Na,00:10:12,00:10:14.200000,and they work they do the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,5,00:10:33,00:20:54.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,1,1.0,2,00:10:33.100000,00:12:47.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:11:22.100000,00:11:45.800000,pause filler you can start,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:11:45.900000,00:12:00.900000,,okay so pause filler all right this thing's weird to control pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
4,1,T1 ,,,1,00:12:25,00:12:29.700000,,so is this how pause filler to start the equation,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,1,00:12:29.900000,00:12:39.700000,pause filler yeah so then the sixes cancel out,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:12:39.900000,00:12:40.100000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:12:40.100000,00:12:42.200000,and then you add thirteen to six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:12:42.800000,00:12:47.300000,,yeah okay so you get x equals pause filler nineteen,,,CA,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:12:47,00:12:48,pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,2,1.0,0,00:12:47.800000,00:13:32.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:12:47.800000,00:12:57.200000,,all right so fifteen equals negative eight plus p,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:12:57.400000,00:13:01,,pause filler so you have fifteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:13:02.300000,00:13:03.400000,,and then you add eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:13:03.400000,00:13:07,,because you undo the eights correct okay,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:13:07.100000,00:13:07.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,0,00:13:08.300000,00:13:22.400000,,eight and so the eights cancel out,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,0,00:13:22.700000,00:13:24.100000,,and then you get fifteen plus eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,0,00:13:24.300000,00:13:29.800000,,pause filler you get twenty-three,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,0,00:13:31.200000,00:13:31.400000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:13:31.700000,00:13:44.200000,,equals p okay all right so this problem works the same as everything else,ODQ,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,1,T1 ,,,0,00:21:47.400000,00:21:50.400000,,you subtract the r,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,0,00:21:50.400000,00:21:52.600000,,pause filler so you're left with one r,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,0,00:21:52.600000,00:22:00.200000,,so you get negative thirty-three equals pause filler r minus fifteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,0,00:22:00.800000,00:22:03.300000,,you add fifteen to both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,0,00:22:05,00:22:16.700000,,so you get pause filler negative thirty-three plus fifteen is negative twenty pause filler eighteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,1,T1 ,,,2,00:27:28.400000,00:27:39.500000,,pause filler one hundred two minus fifty-three is fifty-two minus three is forty-nine equals ten x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,3,00:27:40,00:27:53.400000,,so you get pause filler forty four-point-nine equals x okay pause filler thirteen y plus twenty-seven pause filler,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,3,00:27:53.500000,00:27:55.800000,,it's easier to just subtract that y,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
4,1,T1 ,18,1.0,1,00:27:53.600000,00:28:45.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,3,00:27:56.500000,00:28:07.600000,,so you get twelve y plus twenty-seven equals negative seventy-three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,1,00:28:09.700000,00:28:11.600000,,so you subtract the twenty-seven,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,1,00:28:12.800000,00:28:25.800000,,you get twelve y equals pause filler twenty-seven negative seventy-three a hundred negative one hundred,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

4,1,T1 ,,,1,00:28:26.300000,00:28:37,,okay and negative one hundred twelfths or y equals negative pause filler twenty-five thirds,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,1,00:28:38.100000,00:28:45.700000,,because you can reduce it okay pause filler a hundred okay,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,1,00:28:45.700000,00:28:47.800000,,so you subtract the five p,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

4,1,T1 ,,,1,00:29:05.700000,00:29:07.600000,,pause filler you divide by twenty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,1,T1 ,,,1,00:29:07.600000,00:29:13.200000,,you get five halves equals p,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

4,2,T1 ,,,5,00:23:39.900000,00:23:45.200000,okay oh that equal sign should be there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,5,00:23:45.200000,00:23:57.200000,it's now plus pause filler plus four thirteenths x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,5,00:23:58.400000,00:23:59.900000,pause filler you move that to the other side,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,5,00:23:59.900000,00:24:03.300000,you multiply thirteen by thirteen which is a hundred sixty-nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:24:05.400000,00:24:07.400000,so you have a hundred sixty-nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:24:07.400000,00:24:10.300000,pause filler oh god plus four pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:24:10.900000,00:24:15.100000,so a hundred and seventy pause filler three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:24:17.700000,00:24:19.800000,pause filler it's just clear some of these numbers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:24:25.300000,00:24:26.700000,there you go oh one more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:24:28.400000,00:24:31.700000,okay a hundred seventy-three x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:24:34,00:24:44,over thirteen equals pause filler four hundred and twelve,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:24:44.800000,00:24:56.600000,(sfx) pause filler four hundred twelve times thirteen is four thousand one hundred twenty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:24:56.600000,00:25:09.500000,plus pause filler six thirty and twelve four six five three five three five six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:10.400000,00:25:17.300000,so x equals one hundred seventy-three five three five sixes,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:19.100000,00:25:19.400000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:25.600000,00:25:27.600000,,,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,13,0.0,0,00:25:25.600000,00:28:03.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:25.600000,00:25:27.600000,one fifteenths of x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:27.600000,00:25:33.200000,just cancel,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:33.700000,00:25:35.500000,pause filler really they shouldn't cancel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:35.500000,00:25:39.200000,but I'll solve the equation anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:39.200000,00:25:45,pause filler so one fifteenths of x equals fifteen x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:45.200000,00:25:53.200000,plus pause filler one hundred and thirty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:56,00:25:57.500000,so you move the fifteen x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:57.500000,00:26:01.800000,pause filler you divide by fifteen x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,2,00:26:02.600000,00:26:04.800000,divided by fifteen x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,5,00:26:05.300000,00:26:11.100000,pause filler fifteen divided by one fifteenth divided by one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,5,00:26:16.700000,00:26:19.500000,,you just have to multiply the reciprocal of this,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,5,00:26:19.500000,00:26:25.900000,okay so you oh so you donÀ_t oh my god these are like hugely yeah okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,5,00:26:26.100000,00:26:27.400000,,yeah so instead of one hundred,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,5,00:26:27.400000,00:26:32.400000,fifteen times fifteen is two hundred twenty-five isn't it yeah,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,5,00:26:32.800000,00:26:33.600000,,one wait pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:26:33.700000,00:26:37.100000,because you multiply by the reciprocal,,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:26:37.100000,00:26:39.100000,so you get one pause filler over fifty,,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:26:39.100000,00:26:44.800000,times fifteen x equals one thirty-five,,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:26:44.800000,00:26:46,so you get x,,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:26:48.200000,00:26:52.700000,x equals pause filler one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:26:54.500000,00:27:03.500000,oh my god one thirty-five times,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:27:03.600000,00:27:09.100000,oh okay so you get pause filler five twenty-five pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:27:10,00:27:13,five times two is ten,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:27:14.800000,00:27:16.600000,ten pause filler is ten,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:27:16.700000,00:27:19.600000,so you get that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:27:19.900000,00:27:22,then you get times zero,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T1 ,,,3,00:27:22.200000,00:27:30.100000,you get pause filler three times five is fifteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

4,2,T2 ,,,3,00:56:10.200000,00:56:19.500000,,two seven seven four equals negative two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T2 ,,,3,00:56:22.900000,00:56:29,,add negative two seven seven four to both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T2 ,,,3,00:56:30,00:56:32.100000,,and then yeah pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2,T2 ,,,3,00:56:34.800000,00:56:35.300000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,S1 ,,,3,00:03:41.700000,00:03:45.500000,yeah so are you good at math or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,QE,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,3,00:03:46.300000,00:03:48.700000,,pause filler I'm okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,3,00:03:48.700000,00:03:52,,surprisingly I have a b in the class which I did not think I have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,3,00:03:53.700000,00:03:57.900000,oh well math is like my worst subject,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,3,00:03:58.400000,00:04:01.900000,but I mean I understand like this stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,4,00:04:01.900000,00:04:08.700000,it's just that some of the algebra I'm getting into is just like pretty difficult for me you know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,4,00:04:08.800000,00:04:15.400000,,yeah they're like there's a point where it's not easy to make the transition to go to new math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,4,00:04:16.100000,00:04:21.400000,,so you don't really have the best stuff to position on with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,4,00:04:22,00:04:23.800000,yeah I see what you're saying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,4,00:04:25.200000,00:04:30.800000,,so that I wish there was a better way you could do it like making the transitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:04:31.700000,00:04:43.300000,yeah it's like you know just like like one minute it's like the easiest thing ever like those graphs and then like pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:04:43.500000,00:04:45.900000,,just like small multiplication division stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:04:46,00:04:48.200000,yeah and then all the sudden it's like pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:04:48.500000,00:04:49.200000,,letters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:04:49.300000,00:04:51.700000,letters variables you know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:04:52.500000,00:04:53,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:04:53,00:04:55.800000,,and I don't really understand most of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:04:56.100000,00:05:00,I mean I understand this stuff which is on my paper right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:05:00.200000,00:05:01.700000,I mean I get that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:05:01.800000,00:05:12.400000,but oh like there's just like this weird transition in like the middle of algebra like from algebra half to algebra one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:05:13.400000,00:05:15.600000,that is just ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:05:16.300000,00:05:16.700000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:05:18.400000,00:05:23,and you know sometimes it's really stressful for me you know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:05:23.400000,00:05:28.800000,,uh-huh like oh I don't like math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:05:28.800000,00:05:30.300000,I don't like math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:05:30.400000,00:05:30.600000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:30.600000,00:05:34.300000,I mean the only kid who likes math in my class,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:34.300000,00:05:35.400000,his name is Jacob,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:36.300000,00:05:40,and he basically obsesses almost over every subject,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:40,00:05:44.400000,so I just couldn't talk about him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:45,00:05:45,,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:45.100000,00:05:49.400000,it's like oh the most important thing is learning math and Latin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,6,00:05:49.400000,00:05:53.900000,and I was like what kind of person would want to talk in Latin about math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:05:54.500000,00:06:02.300000,,yeah we have like one kid I know she has I think like a ninety-eight in every class,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:06:08.500000,00:06:10.200000,,and all of her grades were ninety-eights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:06:12.600000,00:06:14.700000,,she's insane in everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:06:15,00:06:16.200000,,I don't know how she does it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:06:16.700000,00:06:19.700000,I don't know how anyone does it to be perfectly honest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,S1 ,,,2,00:07:22.400000,00:07:23.100000,,seventeen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,2,00:07:23.100000,00:07:23.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,2,00:07:23.800000,00:07:26.900000,,okay (inaudible) seems like thirteen or fourteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,2,00:07:26.900000,00:07:30.400000,,and we understand just for like popularity wise you have like a joke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:07:31.300000,00:07:37.900000,,but it depends on really what you see in childhood to really watch the show,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:07:38.400000,00:07:46.400000,oh yeah I mean I was like he's like whatever he has in his computer out or his Xbox out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:07:46.400000,00:07:51.900000,and he has like a profile picture of like I don't know one of the weird things I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,5,00:08:21.600000,00:08:24.900000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S1 ,,,7,00:08:56.700000,00:08:58.800000,all right roger that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:08:58.400000,00:28:56.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:59,00:08:59.700000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,1,1.0,3,00:08:59.600000,00:13:13.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:08:59.700000,00:09:05.200000,all right so pause filler ding it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:06.100000,00:09:14.500000,all right so basically pause filler all right so pause filler you see this problem here,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:15.100000,00:09:15.400000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:15.400000,00:09:19,all right I'm writing good so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:19.500000,00:09:23.100000,all right so basically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:26.400000,00:09:28.700000,pause filler do you see the variable here,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:29.400000,00:09:29.500000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:29.600000,00:09:30.700000,okay why is my thing blue,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:32.600000,00:09:33.500000,,was this supposed to be green,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:34.300000,00:09:34.700000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:34.700000,00:09:38.300000,all right so see the variable over here,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:38.800000,00:09:39,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:39,00:09:43.500000,basically what you have to do is that you have to get the variable by itself,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:44.900000,00:09:52.400000,and pause filler the way you do that is by pause filler adding on both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:09:53.400000,00:10:00.400000,and it's sort of weird I know because math all right so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:00.400000,00:10:14.900000,pause filler what you do is that if you have a subtraction space there if you have sign that's subtracted pause filler what you do is that you write below it add that number,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:15.300000,00:10:15.800000,you see,,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:18.100000,00:10:18.300000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:18.300000,00:10:20.900000,so and then you'd add it to that side,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:20.900000,00:10:24.200000,so you'd write plus number on the thirteen you,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:24.900000,00:10:25.600000,see what I'm saying,,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:25.100000,00:10:26.300000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T1 ,,,Na,00:10:27.800000,00:10:30,,so let's take a walk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:32,00:10:33.900000,,so here you'd be adding okay,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:35.400000,00:10:35.600000,,wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:35.600000,00:10:36.200000,,this is weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:38,00:10:43.900000,oh it's all right yeah (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:43.900000,00:10:44.300000,,wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:45.800000,00:10:49.600000,oh no no no you don't add the x,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:49.800000,00:10:51.600000,you add the six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:51.600000,00:10:52.900000,,oh that's right,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:52.900000,00:10:53.700000,,I can do that okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:54.100000,00:10:57.500000,,let's see I can undo this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:10:57.600000,00:11:01.200000,like have you ever used one of these things before,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,0,00:11:01.600000,00:11:02,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:02.700000,00:11:06.300000,oh man it works like a charm if you're trying to like draw on stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:06.500000,00:11:08.600000,but I have like a surface,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:08.800000,00:11:12.200000,so basically what I do is that I get a Bluetooth mouse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:12.600000,00:11:16.500000,and I use that to draw most of the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:16.500000,00:11:18.300000,but pause filler anyways let's just get back on topic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:18.600000,00:11:21.600000,so what you do is that you would add the number not the variable,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:21.700000,00:11:23.800000,you want to get the variable by itself,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:24.100000,00:11:24.500000,,uh-huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:25,00:11:25.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:25.400000,00:11:28.600000,,so then here would be the plus six,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:11:28.900000,00:11:32.200000,,and yeah I'll also add six,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:11:32.900000,00:11:33.400000,pause filler yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:11:33.400000,00:11:33.800000,correct,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:11:34.200000,00:11:37.300000,,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:11:38.700000,00:11:45.100000,pause filler basically pause filler just scratch out the six sort of like pause filler sort of like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:11:48,00:11:49.200000,,I see there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:11:52,00:11:55,so just pretend that six doesn't exist anymore,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:11:56,00:11:56.300000,,right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:11:56.900000,00:11:59.900000,oh and I'll rewrite that because I accidentally did it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:11:59.900000,00:12:02.700000,I was trying to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:05.300000,00:12:06.700000,oh whoops crap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:09.800000,00:12:13.800000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:15.300000,00:12:18.700000,are you still scratching up the six now,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:18.700000,00:12:25.600000,all you have to do is put a cross between the negative six and the plus six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:26.100000,00:12:29.800000,but you keep the six on the thirteen side as it is,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:30.200000,00:12:33.800000,,right wait okay it asked me a question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:33.800000,00:12:34.800000,,so I don't know why I did that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:36.100000,00:12:38.300000,it went full screen on my Skype for a second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:39.200000,00:12:40.100000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:43,00:12:47.400000,okay so you see pause filler all you need to do is just add,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:49,00:12:51.300000,,so then this would be nineteen,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:51.300000,00:12:51.500000,,great,,,CA,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:51.500000,00:12:51.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:12:52.700000,00:12:58.700000,,we'll put a nine there and separate that,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:12:58.700000,00:13:03.900000,and then you'd write x sequels because that's the only thing left,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:04.600000,00:13:09.600000,,oh yeah so then okay yeah that's starting to make sense,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:09.900000,00:13:11.900000,yeah so now you're done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:12.500000,00:13:12.900000,,sweet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,2,0.0,3,00:13:14.400000,00:14:38.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:14.900000,00:13:17.300000,,so we go to the next problem right,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:17.600000,00:13:21.800000,yeah all right so that would be oh my gosh twenty-three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:21.900000,00:13:24.900000,all right this is going to be the end of me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:24.900000,00:13:34.200000,so all right so usually get a basic of this one right because all you have to do is just add again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:34.200000,00:13:35.800000,you just add to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:35.900000,00:13:40.200000,so it's basically just do it again I guess it's a,,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:40.400000,00:13:44.100000,,it's good practice to fully understand it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:44.400000,00:13:49.800000,yeah and the only difference here is that it's flipped,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:49.800000,00:13:51.200000,and that it has a p,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:51.600000,00:13:55.600000,I don't know how that's supposed to confuse us in anyway whatsoever but (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:13:55.600000,00:14:01.700000,,so I was going to cross that out because it's not really going to do much,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,1,00:14:01.900000,00:14:06.300000,yeah you could just cross at it first I mean pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,1,00:14:09.700000,00:14:23.900000,they write really weird on this paper because they have like oh I'm not allowed to showed it but they put like the nine after the p (laughter) like the plus eight after,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,1,00:14:24.400000,00:14:25.300000,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,1,00:14:25.800000,00:14:27.400000,,that's strange,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,1,00:14:27.500000,00:14:28.100000,I know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,1,00:14:28.900000,00:14:30.900000,college students you know all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,1,00:14:30.900000,00:14:31.100000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:14:31.900000,00:14:33.800000,all right so you got that one,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:14:33.800000,00:14:37.400000,I'm just going to do that to confirm it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:14:37.700000,00:14:38.400000,pause filler next page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,3,1.0,6,00:14:39.600000,00:15:31.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:14:40,00:14:42.100000,,this is subtraction right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:14:42.900000,00:14:43.500000,yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:14:43.700000,00:14:53,all right so pause filler basically what you do is that instead of adding like we did before we subtract,,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:14:53,00:14:54,whoo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:14:53.900000,00:14:54,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:14:54,00:15:11.200000,and then (inaudible) because that's going to that's pause filler because that's a pause filler addition symbol,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:11.800000,00:15:19.200000,pause filler and basically what you have to do is that you have to do the exact opposite of the symbol that's up there,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:19.300000,00:15:19.600000,you see,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:20.300000,00:15:20.900000,,yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:21.200000,00:15:22.400000,pause filler so basically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:23.800000,00:15:27,pause filler it's really simple (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:27.400000,00:15:31.100000,and then you just do it the other side I mean,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,4,1.0,6,00:15:31.400000,00:18:11.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:31.400000,00:15:34.400000,and they also made it okay this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:34.400000,00:15:37.100000,so that's the part that confused me the most,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:37.200000,00:15:37.700000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:37.800000,00:15:38.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:38.500000,00:15:45.100000,,so this is basically just six equals k,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:47.500000,00:15:48.100000,,right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:48.300000,00:15:48.600000,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:49.300000,00:15:53.700000,we don't even need to do that much work for that one because that's like simple simple math,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:15:53.800000,00:15:55.600000,all right good job,,,,,,,,,,,,,LPB,,,,,,

5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:16:13.500000,00:16:16.500000,all you have to do is divide,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:16:17.400000,00:16:18,and then you're done,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:16:18,00:16:20.900000,,I think I got it already,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,SD,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:16:20.900000,00:16:23.100000,you did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:16:23.300000,00:16:24.900000,,yeah I saw it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:16:24.900000,00:16:26,,and then it came to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:16:26.400000,00:16:30.900000,,but I think I'll do the math just in case okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:16:31.100000,00:16:37,yeah because they want you to do the math and stuff like that because they have like cameras all around us and stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:16:38,00:16:39.200000,,yeah I don't like camearas,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:16:39.200000,00:16:41.100000,I know they're scary (sfx),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:03,00:17:03.400000,pause filler five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:04.300000,00:17:07.100000,pause filler how explain your answer,,,AE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:07.500000,00:17:09.600000,,okay I'll explain it in math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:12.500000,00:17:12.800000,,got five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:13.900000,00:17:18.400000,,it doesn't really look like a five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:18.800000,00:17:19.700000,,so that's twenty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:19.700000,00:17:21,,so we got zero there,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:21.400000,00:17:21.900000,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:24,00:17:25.400000,,undo that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:25.700000,00:17:26,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:26.900000,00:17:28.400000,,I don't want it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:28.400000,00:17:29.700000,,okay there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:17:30.100000,00:17:31.700000,,we put the zero there,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:17:32.100000,00:17:35.100000,,and then five times four is twenty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:17:35.100000,00:17:39.900000,,so you have an extra two y two twenty,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:17:39.900000,00:17:41,,hey it is right,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:17:42.600000,00:17:47.500000,,I do my math right right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:17:48.500000,00:17:51,pause filler hold on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:17:52.200000,00:17:52.700000,pause filler forty-four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:17:52.700000,00:17:55.200000,then we go into that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:17:55.200000,00:17:56.300000,then we go into that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:17:58.400000,00:17:59.700000,yeah you're correct,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:01.100000,00:18:07.100000,all right so basically what you do is that you'd say x equals five because pause filler the two twenty is gone,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:07.100000,00:18:08.400000,and then the forty-four is gone,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:08.400000,00:18:11.100000,so you just have to leave it at five so,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:11.100000,00:18:15.800000,pause filler all right perfect line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:15.800000,00:18:17.500000,all right page five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:18:15.800000,00:26:19.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:17.900000,00:18:20.900000,oh I don't want to double-click,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:22.400000,00:18:22.900000,oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:22.900000,00:18:24.500000,now it's showing me Adobe Flash Player,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:24.500000,00:18:26.700000,this isn't an Adobe Flash game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:26.700000,00:18:28.200000,and I just closed another room,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:28.900000,00:18:31.700000,well I don't think that did anything I hope (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:31.900000,00:18:35.900000,all right what's this,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:37.400000,00:18:42.700000,all right pause filler if you saw that that's just what I'm clarifying pause filler people CMU so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:42.700000,00:18:50.300000,,is that are there is that a minus with the thirteen p and forty-one or is that an equal sign,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:51.100000,00:18:53.700000,,for some reason I only see one line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:55.300000,00:18:57.100000,oh you just have to click the screen again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:18:57.800000,00:18:58.100000,,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:18:59.600000,00:19:02.400000,oh you see it now,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:19:03.500000,00:19:05.100000,,yeah I faintly see it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:19:05.100000,00:19:07.200000,,so I got that in mind now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:19:07.200000,00:19:13.300000,pause filler it's minus nine plus thirteen p equals forty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:19:15.100000,00:19:15.600000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:19:16.700000,00:19:19.300000,,let's see how we would oh wait so we would,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:19:21.700000,00:19:24.900000,,add nine to the negative nine and forty-one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:19:26.600000,00:19:28.700000,we'd add nine to forty-one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:19:28.700000,00:19:31.800000,we wouldn't do anything with subtraction,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:19:33.400000,00:19:41.100000,,right so plus because pause filler we're just doing the opposite on the other side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:19:41.400000,00:19:42.200000,,we're not really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:19:43.500000,00:19:49.900000,,oh yeah so the negative nine really doesn't have any value to us as of right now,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:19:49.900000,00:19:52.900000,yeah and all you have to do is do it on the other side too,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:19:52.900000,00:19:57.100000,and then just cross it out because it says they said we have to like show our work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:19:57.100000,00:19:58.800000,and that's why we typically do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:00.200000,00:20:03,,yeah so only teachers could explain it this simply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:03.500000,00:20:07.400000,pause filler hearing it from a kid is like ten times better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:07.900000,00:20:09,,yeah why,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:09,00:20:10.900000,,I can't draw on this,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:11.700000,00:20:12,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:13.500000,00:20:17.900000,,okay let's see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:18.200000,00:20:18.900000,,here we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:19.200000,00:20:21.900000,whoops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:21.900000,00:20:23.500000,,yeah I'll draw another one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:23.900000,00:20:24.400000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:24.500000,00:20:24.900000,,here we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:24.900000,00:20:26.600000,yeah yeah all right you got fifty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:27.200000,00:20:28.800000,,fifty and thirteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:28.800000,00:20:31.300000,and then here comes the trickier part,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:31.500000,00:20:38.500000,you have (laughter) oh you have to pause filler divide fifty by thirteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:38.500000,00:20:42,,oh you got to be kidding me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:42,00:20:44.100000,which is actually pretty difficult,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:44.300000,00:20:46.900000,,yeah because it doesn't go into any bits,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:46.900000,00:20:49.100000,,so you have to figure out what number it is,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:50.700000,00:20:56,yeah so just I mean it will take a while because we're riding on this thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:56,00:20:58.400000,and you're obviously a newbie to this sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:20:59,00:21:05.500000,so pause filler might pause filler be a bit difficult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:21:06.100000,00:21:09,,all right I'm going to wing it here,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:21:09.400000,00:21:13,,and see where pause filler thirteen times five gets me,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:21:13.900000,00:21:17.500000,,and then I'll try to see how that goes,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:21:18,00:21:19.200000,thirteen times five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:21:19.200000,00:21:20.200000,how does that work,,,AE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:21:20.300000,00:21:26.600000,,pause filler well for me what I would do is that I would you know do the problem,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:21:26.600000,00:21:30.800000,,and if that's not the number I'd to go a little higher then to a little lower which then,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:21:30.800000,00:21:31.200000,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:21:32.200000,00:21:34.700000,,wow that's not it at all,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:21:35.800000,00:21:41.100000,,pause filler I'm going to try four because four seems to be the magic number today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:21:43.300000,00:21:46.400000,,all right do me some good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:21:48.800000,00:21:50.500000,,okay that's not a twelve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:21:50.500000,00:21:51.100000,,that's not a two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:21:51.100000,00:21:52.900000,that's a twenty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:21:52.900000,00:21:54.700000,that's a z oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:21:55.400000,00:21:56.900000,,it's something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:21:57.100000,00:21:57.900000,,it's something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:21:59.300000,00:21:59.900000,surely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:22:00.800000,00:22:01.300000,,so it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:01.800000,00:22:02.500000,,wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:02.800000,00:22:04.400000,,that's actually really close,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:05.700000,00:22:08,,so my guess it would be three because,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:09.100000,00:22:10,I don't think it would be three,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:10,00:22:15.100000,it would have to be pause filler a decimal number because pause filler it's between three and four,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:15.300000,00:22:19.100000,pause filler if you did three and if you did basic math you'd get thirty-nine,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:19.800000,00:22:23,,yeah so we would have so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:23.200000,00:22:24.500000,you just have to divide,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:24.500000,00:22:26.600000,I mean there's really no other way of doing it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:27.100000,00:22:29.500000,,yeah so we get there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:22:29.800000,00:22:31,,and it would be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:22:34.600000,00:22:34.900000,,wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:22:34.900000,00:22:38.900000,,this okay so we would get eleven from this right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:22:39.300000,00:22:40.800000,,if we were to subtract this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:22:42.400000,00:22:43.400000,,I'm totally stumped,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:22:43.400000,00:22:44.800000,,I'm totally stumped,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:22:44.800000,00:22:48.100000,all right so let me tell you what you would do,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:22:48.500000,00:22:51.800000,so basically what you would do is that you just write thirteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:22:52.600000,00:22:53.400000,and undo that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:22:53.700000,00:22:55.600000,and then fifty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:22:59.300000,00:22:59.800000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:23:00.400000,00:23:08,and then what you do is that you try to find the highest number that's closest to this which is pause filler three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:23:08.900000,00:23:09.300000,,yeah,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:23:10.900000,00:23:12,and then you do that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:23:12,00:23:13.300000,and you get thirty-nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:23:16.100000,00:23:18,and then you'd cross out the five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:23:18,00:23:19.100000,and then you get the four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:23:19.600000,00:23:20.600000,and then you get that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:23:21.100000,00:23:23.700000,and then you get one hundred and ten,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:23:24,00:23:30.700000,and then what you'd have to do is you'd have to ridiculously try to find what one hundred and ten is,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:23:31.200000,00:23:36.100000,so pause filler thirteen times,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:23:38.200000,00:23:39.400000,pause filler let's try eight,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:23:40.500000,00:23:41.700000,pause filler twenty-four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:23:45.600000,00:23:46.600000,pause filler one zero four,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:23:46.700000,00:23:47.500000,that's correct,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:23:48,00:23:56.400000,so it would be eight and one zero four pause filler oh six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:23:59.500000,00:24:00.300000,sixty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:24:01.200000,00:24:06.900000,now if you we're going to get an answer like this it's going to be like infinite all right,,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:24:07.300000,00:24:07.600000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:24:08,00:24:11.300000,pause filler what we're going to do is that we're going to get this,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:24:11.700000,00:24:12.700000,and then we're going to do it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:24:12.700000,00:24:14.700000,we're going to get one more decimal number,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:24:15.100000,00:24:20.200000,and if it's above five we just set it to the number above it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:24:20.200000,00:24:23.900000,so pause filler let's say we get seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:24:26.200000,00:24:29.200000,pause filler we get like three point seven eight,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:24:29.600000,00:24:32.400000,if this number is four we don't have to change it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:24:33.100000,00:24:38.100000,,oh yeah because it rounds up or down depending on the number and then the last of it,,,,,,ER,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:24:38.200000,00:24:41.300000,yeah yeah and so basically this is just going to be a rounding thing,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:24:44.700000,00:24:47.200000,and yeah so pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:24:50.400000,00:24:51.400000,thirteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:24:53.500000,00:24:55,,and sixteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:24:57.900000,00:24:59.100000,,wouldn't that be four then,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:24:59.400000,00:25:00.400000,it would have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:25:02.700000,00:25:04.900000,,yeah because thirteen times four is fifty-two,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:25:06.700000,00:25:09.700000,yeah right you're looking at your previous work,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:25:09.700000,00:25:11.100000,and I'm not (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:25:11.100000,00:25:14,all right and then fifty-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:25:14,00:25:15.800000,oh I'm going off the page ding it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:25:16.200000,00:25:17.600000,and then that would be eight,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:25:19.400000,00:25:21,and then that would be eighty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:25:21,00:25:25,so it's obviously a number higher than five you see,,,CU,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:25:25.100000,00:25:27.900000,so this would round to,,,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:25:28.800000,00:25:30,,three point eight five,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:27:15.500000,00:27:18.400000,well it just takes time to get used to I mean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:27:18.700000,00:27:23.400000,,yeah well everything in general takes time to get used to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:27:23.900000,00:27:27.300000,yeah like I've only used this three times but I don't own one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,3,00:27:27.300000,00:27:28.700000,but I am really good at using it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:27:28.700000,00:27:34.400000,like I could just like draw something really good on this side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,IDQ
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:27:34.600000,00:27:40.500000,but (inaudible) pause filler yes six divided by twenty-four that's four equals x right,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:27:40.500000,00:27:42.900000,we actually got a simpler answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:27:42.900000,00:27:45.100000,thank you CMU all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:27:45.300000,00:27:49.100000,,I don't understand college technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:27:49.100000,00:27:55.400000,(inaudible) pause filler this is like I'm in a game designing studios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,5,00:27:55.400000,00:27:59.800000,so I guess that's why they use this so (inaudible) yeah so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:27:59.800000,00:28:04.800000,,I have a room surrounded by glass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:28:06.400000,00:28:07.800000,that is terrifying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:28:08,00:28:08.400000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:28:08.700000,00:28:15.500000,all right so pause filler this one is a bit easier I guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:28:15.500000,00:28:18.400000,so take note I said I guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:28:18.900000,00:28:27.600000,so pause filler what we're going to do is that this is probably going to be another one of those problems where it's going to be like ridiculously like pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,7,00:28:27.700000,00:28:30.700000,,just a crazy crazy number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:28:31,00:28:36.100000,yeah so all we have to do is that we have to make a fraction this time all right,,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:28:36.200000,00:28:37.700000,,yeah a fraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:28:37.900000,00:28:42.100000,yeah because we're wait one minute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:28:47,00:28:47.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:28:47.300000,00:28:52.700000,I'm not looking at this at all pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:28:52.800000,00:28:57.700000,,all right hang on a sec,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:29:03,00:29:03.300000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,6,00:29:23.200000,00:29:23.800000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:29:37.500000,00:29:38.100000,roger that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T1 ,,,4,00:29:40.900000,00:29:43.500000,all right so now you're going to tutor me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,2,00:29:41.900000,00:35:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:43.900000,00:29:44.900000,,sweet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:44.900000,00:29:54.600000,yeah so basically what's going to happen is that you're going to pause filler master the art of the pause filler this thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:55.200000,00:29:57.400000,and it's going to be great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:29:57.400000,00:30:02.100000,like what you get used to it it's going to be sweet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:02.500000,00:30:09.600000,you're going to be like mastering pause filler as you animate people say it going Super Saiyan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:09.600000,00:30:10.800000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:11,00:30:14.400000,yeah so pause filler weirdos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:14.500000,00:30:19.100000,anyway basically pause filler it's sort of hard to get used to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:19.100000,00:30:22.600000,but once you start to realize that it's just like a piece of paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:23.100000,00:30:24.400000,it's really really easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:24.900000,00:30:29.500000,,yeah like the one thing that gets me off is that you have like a smaller pad to draw on,,,,,,,,,,,,,SD,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:29.500000,00:30:31.200000,,but then the pad gets so much larger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:32.600000,00:30:38.900000,oh yeah basically what they use this for is that they're able to adjust the page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:38.900000,00:30:39.900000,but we're not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:40.100000,00:30:44.200000,like you have to be on like that side (inaudible) the thing that we on that side is okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:44.400000,00:30:47.300000,so it's basically like telling us how big the page should be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:47.400000,00:30:57.500000,so it's sort of like an adaption process because you have to like pause filler on the screen you have to like get used to the size,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:30:58,00:31:07.700000,so basically if you're to do a straight line like this on this thing on that side it be like the way you'd want it to be drawn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:31:07.700000,00:31:15,but if you're to do this and that page is like this it's going to like be really short,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:31:15.600000,00:31:17.300000,,yeah oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:31:18.600000,00:31:18.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:31:19,00:31:20.900000,,if only this is like heat sensitive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:31:20.900000,00:31:22.200000,,so I can use my hands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:31:22.700000,00:31:23.800000,,this would be so much easier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:31:24.200000,00:31:25.700000,oh yeah definitely but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,Na,00:31:25.700000,00:31:27.300000,and they don't have the mouses turned on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,S2 ,,,2,00:35:24.100000,00:35:26.800000,I think I exited out the other one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,2,00:35:28.500000,00:35:28.600000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,6,00:35:38.300000,00:35:39.100000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,S2 ,,,6,00:35:46.700000,00:35:50.200000,and I accidentally closed pause filler that one so pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,6,00:35:51.900000,00:35:53.600000,yeah that's really cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,S2 ,,,6,00:35:53.600000,00:35:55.500000,all right so I'm going to get everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:14.700000,00:36:18.800000,all right pause filler you have to teach me how to use this problem because I have no idea what I'm doing,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,SD,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:19.200000,00:36:25.700000,,okay so you have the x here,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:26.200000,00:36:29.700000,,the idea is you want to leave that x alone and don't touch it,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:30.800000,00:36:34.400000,,you want to actually add three to this three so,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:36.200000,00:36:41.200000,what if I heard this before,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:41.900000,00:36:43.900000,,so yeah you pause filler add three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:44.300000,00:36:47.300000,,and that gets you zero,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:48.100000,00:36:52.200000,,and yeah so then you know what to do from here right,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:36:58.900000,00:37:02.300000,all right so pause filler basically what I get twenty-five,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:02.300000,00:37:03.100000,and then I'm done,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:04.400000,00:37:05.800000,,yeah twenty-five equals x,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:05.800000,00:37:06.900000,,. that is good,,,,,,,CF,,,,LP,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:06.900000,00:37:09.800000,,I'm going to put a checkmark yay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:13.800000,00:37:20,,okay so see if you do another one like this again,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:20,00:37:24.800000,all right but this one we haven't done before,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:25.500000,00:37:26.600000,do you know how to do this one,,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:27,00:37:27.300000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:27.600000,00:37:29.200000,all right so tell me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:30,00:37:33.800000,oh I went into full screen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:33.800000,00:37:35.800000,(laughter) all right I'm good now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:37.100000,00:37:37.500000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:40.800000,00:37:42.300000,,so wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:45.700000,00:37:47,,okay yeah all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:47.200000,00:37:52.800000,,let's go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:53.200000,00:37:55.400000,,you're going to go,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:55.400000,00:37:57.100000,we didn't do this one yet,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:57.100000,00:37:58.200000,so you have to touch me how to do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:58.200000,00:37:59.500000,,all right all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,Na,00:37:59.800000,00:38:01.400000,I know how to do it but (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,SD,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,0,00:38:01.400000,00:38:03.400000,,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,0,00:38:03.400000,00:38:04.400000,we have to do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,0,00:38:04.400000,00:38:05,I'm sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,0,00:38:05.900000,00:38:08.500000,,so for this you want the y to be positive,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,0,00:38:08.500000,00:38:12.600000,,so you're actually going to add a y to the y okay,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,0,00:38:12.700000,00:38:14.300000,,I'll (inaudible) for a second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,0,00:38:15.400000,00:38:20.800000,,and here you're also going to subtract the eighteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,0,00:38:20.800000,00:38:23.200000,,so you can do that,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:38:24.200000,00:38:34.900000,,so whenever you have like one positive number without positive or negative the idea is to get you want to add the opposite of that,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:38:35.100000,00:38:39,,so you actually want to subtract eighteen from the eighteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:38:39.300000,00:38:40.600000,,and get zero,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:38:40.600000,00:38:44.900000,,but then you'd also going to subtract that eighteen from the twenty-three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:38:46.700000,00:38:53.200000,actually I think what you do pause filler is that you'd subtract the twenty-three,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:38:53.200000,00:38:54.300000,not the eighteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:38:55.800000,00:38:57.600000,because you want to get y on this side,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:38:59,00:38:59.400000,right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:39:00.600000,00:39:00.900000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:01.200000,00:39:02.700000,oh all right yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:02.700000,00:39:04.500000,and then you do that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:04.500000,00:39:06.900000,and then you did twenty-three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:07.300000,00:39:09.100000,and then you'd minus twenty-three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:09.200000,00:39:10.300000,ops that's a two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:10.300000,00:39:11.800000,all right and then op,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:14.300000,00:39:18.400000,then this is what my homework looks like so (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:18.500000,00:39:20.800000,,so you do that,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:21,00:39:23.800000,yeah pause filler and then you get negative five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:23.900000,00:39:25.600000,and then you get y,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:26.400000,00:39:28.200000,and then that's what it equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:39:28.400000,00:39:30.500000,,all right yeah that's good,,,,,,,CF,,,,LP,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:31.600000,00:39:32.200000,,go with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:32.400000,00:39:33,I mean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:33,00:39:34.400000,oh my god,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:34.400000,00:39:35.500000,what is that a v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:36,00:39:37.500000,,it's supposed to be a checkmark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:37.500000,00:39:40.900000,,it's not like the pencil where mine just keep drawing out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:41,00:39:41.400000,,here we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:41.400000,00:39:42.100000,oh there you go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:42.300000,00:39:43,there you got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:43.200000,00:39:46.700000,,to complete checkmark thing all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:49.700000,00:39:50.300000,,oh wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,3,1.0,6,00:39:50.100000,00:41:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,7,00:39:50.300000,00:39:52.400000,,okay let's see with this one now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:39:54.400000,00:40:03.200000,,so here it's going to be confusing because now you have two variables and two numbers pause filler on different sides,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:40:03.700000,00:40:08.600000,,so one of the first things you actually want to do is you want to add k to both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:40:09.300000,00:40:14.300000,,so yeah each k is going to receive a k,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:40:15.400000,00:40:19.900000,,and the positive k is going to become two k you know,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:40:19.900000,00:40:25.600000,ah yeah like has a y2k robot is taking over right yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:40:26,00:40:28.100000,,yeah yeah stuff like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:40:28.100000,00:40:28.500000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:40:29.400000,00:40:31.300000,,and so you can go ahead,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:31.300000,00:40:32.100000,,and can do that,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:34,00:40:35.900000,oh what not a two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:35.900000,00:40:39.700000,I don't want a two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:41.300000,00:40:44.100000,,pause filler hitting undo in this thing is so hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:44.900000,00:40:46.200000,pause filler it's easy for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:46.200000,00:40:47.300000,you just got to get used to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:48,00:40:48.400000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:49.100000,00:40:50.700000,pause filler and then you get two k,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:52.100000,00:40:54.600000,well that was like I've been drawing like perfect ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:54.600000,00:40:55.400000,I'm on a streak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:56.100000,00:40:59.500000,so then what I do is minus thirty-six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:59.800000,00:41:00.700000,,that's right,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:01.800000,00:41:03.400000,minus thirty-six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:07,00:41:14.500000,and then that would be negative fifty equals two k and then two k,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:15.700000,00:41:18.400000,but not the k I don't want that so,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:18.400000,00:41:19.900000,and then you divide that by two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:20.400000,00:41:22.800000,but then two divided by fifty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:41:26,00:41:28.600000,pause filler two four pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:41:29.900000,00:41:33.900000,,twenty-five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:41:35,00:41:37.800000,oh yeah I forgot,,,,,,,,,CF,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:41:38,00:41:38.800000,twenty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:41:38.800000,00:41:43.400000,and then k equals twenty-five,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:41:45.300000,00:41:49.200000,,yeah yeah that's correct,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:41:49.200000,00:41:51.900000,,all right so we got this page down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,4,1.0,5,00:41:53.600000,00:42:34.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:41:53.600000,00:41:54.200000,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:41:55.100000,00:41:55.800000,,oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:41:55.800000,00:41:58.100000,,this is really hard to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T2 ,,,1,00:49:05.900000,00:49:09.700000,so pause filler so basically x equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,1,00:49:13.100000,00:49:15.600000,pause filler forty-two over fourteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,1,00:49:15.600000,00:49:17.900000,that's negative all right,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T2 ,,,1,00:49:24.400000,00:49:28.600000,,yeah so fourteen times two is twenty-eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,1,00:49:29.100000,00:49:30.900000,,and add another fourteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:30.900000,00:49:36.700000,,and you get forty-two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:37.300000,00:49:40.800000,oh pause filler so wouldn't be that,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:41.800000,00:49:44.700000,,well that answer is correct,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:44.700000,00:49:47.500000,,but to fully simplify you would have pause filler,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:47.500000,00:49:47.600000,,three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:47.600000,00:49:48.100000,,right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:48.700000,00:49:52.600000,,or is it negative,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:52:08.100000,00:52:13.500000,this isn't going to be the way I want it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:52:13.500000,00:52:16.300000,so twenty-five equals nine negative,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:52:17.600000,00:52:18.200000,,there we go,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:52:19.900000,00:52:20.900000,,correct again,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,9,0.0,1,00:52:22.400000,00:54:34.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:52:22.600000,00:52:24.900000,,all right well this looks new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:52:25.600000,00:52:26.100000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,3,00:52:26.100000,00:52:30.700000,,I'm going to have to review this in a few seconds all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:52:31.800000,00:52:40.900000,,so before you would just have like you could have like negative p minus it to eight minus p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:52:41.200000,00:52:45.200000,,but now you actually have you do have ps,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:52:45.300000,00:52:47.500000,,but now one of the p is was an eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,6,00:52:48.200000,00:52:57.500000,,so what you're going to do to this number here and the p here is each of those will receive their very own p,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:52:58.300000,00:53:03.600000,,so that's right yeah okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:53:04.200000,00:53:06.900000,wait the sixteen gets on the variable,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:53:08.500000,00:53:10.300000,,wait is this (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:53:15.200000,00:53:17.400000,,yeah or this might actually be a typo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:53:17.400000,00:53:19.100000,,let's see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:53:19.100000,00:53:23.200000,no there's no way the sixteen could get a p of a variable,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,4,00:53:23.200000,00:53:24.100000,that's impossible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:53:29.300000,00:53:33.600000,,oh okay they did it in a way where I could not understand it,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:53:34.700000,00:53:38.100000,,the eight p receives so it becomes nine p,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:53:39.400000,00:53:42.500000,yeah like these college students are weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:53:42.500000,00:53:51.800000,,yeah because they're saying like add five y plus six to the six which we actually really mean to the five y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:53:53.500000,00:53:58.200000,,so I don't really understand why they're explaining it like that because it makes no sense,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:54:05.300000,00:54:06.300000,good god,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:54:13.300000,00:54:19.700000,I get thirty-six pause filler,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:54:19.700000,00:54:23.200000,and then the p would equal four because I said so,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
5,1,T2 ,,,5,00:54:23.200000,00:54:24.100000,all right let's go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T1 ,,,5,00:15:40,00:15:42.700000,,because you multiply y here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,5,00:15:42.700000,00:15:44.400000,,and the y would cancel out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,5,00:15:42.700000,00:15:44.400000,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,5,00:15:44.700000,00:15:46.500000,,and those two multiply on this side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:16:11.400000,00:16:14.100000,and then you're dividing three by one hundred four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:16:14.100000,00:16:15.700000,and four divided by three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T1 ,,,4,00:16:44.400000,00:16:46.400000,,and we're going to have a left over two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,4,00:16:49.500000,00:16:50.700000,,you can't even really see it from here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,4,00:16:50.700000,00:16:52.600000,,because the bar down here blocks it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:18:09.700000,00:18:13.900000,,okay so we're going to have the twenty over here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:18:09.700000,00:18:13.900000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:18:15.200000,00:18:17.400000,,and then minus the eighteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:18:15.200000,00:18:17.400000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:18:18.900000,00:18:20.300000,no that's infinite pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:18:20.900000,00:18:23.500000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:18:20.900000,00:18:23.500000,,yeah so then you would have two over three because,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:18:23.500000,00:18:25.500000,you'd put the line over the three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:28.600000,00:18:31,,no but wouldn't that be with decimals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:32.200000,00:18:34.100000,oh that yeah that would be with decimals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ

5,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:40.200000,00:18:42.900000,,yeah I'm a little confused,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:43,00:18:49.900000,,I think if it's infinite you just put like two over three to show that it can never be simplified to a whole number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:43,00:18:49.900000,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:49.900000,00:18:51.800000,yeah so that's what I was thinking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:51.800000,00:18:54,so just write the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:54.400000,00:18:59.500000,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,6,00:18:54.400000,00:18:59.500000,,yeah so in the end I got like negative forty-six to over three equalsy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:18:59.800000,00:19:01.500000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:02.900000,00:19:03.400000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:04,00:19:06.800000,all right (inaudible) but that's over right,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:06.800000,00:19:07.500000,all right pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:16.100000,00:19:21.800000,all right what you do is you subtract thirteen basically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:22.400000,00:19:25,because this is a plus you see,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:22.400000,00:19:25,,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:26,00:19:26.200000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:19:27.300000,00:19:27.700000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,5,00:19:28.500000,00:19:36.400000,,so well technically what I could just do here is that I can just wipe whoa I can just wipe about the thirteen and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,5,00:19:28.500000,00:19:36.400000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T1 ,,,5,00:19:38.800000,00:19:43.300000,,and I can just turn the forty-four into a thirty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,5,00:19:45.500000,00:19:47.200000,,that saves up a whole lot of room,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,5,00:19:47.700000,00:19:48.400000,indeed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,5,00:19:53.800000,00:19:57,,I want to redo that and pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T1 ,,,4,00:23:16.700000,00:23:18.800000,,I was let me do it quickly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,4,00:23:24.100000,00:23:24.900000,,top there pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:23:27.300000,00:23:36.400000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:23:27.300000,00:23:36.400000,,twenty-one to twelve for one forty-one over six,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:23:38.600000,00:23:43,with six all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:23:43,00:23:44.900000,and then it's just six to the infinite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:23:44.900000,00:23:49.900000,so that's what I get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:23:50.500000,00:24:05.800000,,all right I'm going to see if this would work here well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:07.900000,00:24:17.500000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:07.900000,00:24:17.500000,,and this would be a two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:18.700000,00:24:23.600000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:18.700000,00:24:23.600000,,so this should be two over six,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:24.200000,00:24:38,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:24.200000,00:24:38,,so technically you would have twenty twenty-three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:24:38.900000,00:24:57.200000,,all right that's what I get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:04.500000,00:25:06.100000,I think (sfx),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:07.200000,00:25:19.400000,I don't see the sixty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:21,00:25:23.200000,there should be a sixty-one in this problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,2,00:25:25.400000,00:25:27.800000,,okay let's see sixty plus sixty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T1 ,,,3,00:25:36,00:25:52.600000,all right so whenever you whenever you multiply them both sides you got to do six over three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,4,00:25:55.200000,00:26:00.100000,and then six over three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,4,00:26:00.100000,00:26:11.700000,and then you have one hundred eighty-six over three see,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,4,00:26:12.700000,00:26:13.700000,,oh yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T1 ,,,4,00:26:14.400000,00:26:21.200000,so we might have to redo this problem all over again so here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:45:43.900000,00:45:51.300000,,you're going to multiply this problem by one over k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:45:52.600000,00:45:59.400000,,and as you do that this actually nope hang on I messed up real quick (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:45:59.400000,00:46:06.400000,,(inaudible) let me real quick so I don't forget where I'm at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:06.500000,00:46:10.600000,,all right you're also going to you forgot to add to the k here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:06.500000,00:46:10.600000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:11.400000,00:46:13.400000,,to actually do that I would like to first start,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:13.900000,00:46:15.300000,,this actually cancels it out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:13.900000,00:46:15.300000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:15.300000,00:46:21.700000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:15.300000,00:46:21.700000,,and then you would have four equals sixty-two k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:21.700000,00:46:24.900000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:21.700000,00:46:24.900000,,now you have to simplify it from there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:24.900000,00:46:26.100000,,and I'm going to let you do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,1,00:46:26.100000,00:46:26.700000,all right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:46:31.300000,00:46:39,,yeah honestly having someone around your age teach you math helps out so much better than someone who's a lot older than you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:46:39.900000,00:46:42.800000,oh yeah because you know it's a kid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,

5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:46:56.300000,00:46:58.200000,I found the way to use the calculator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:46:59,00:46:59.600000,,really,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:46:59.800000,00:47:00.300000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:03.900000,00:47:05.900000,,I actually think that they're recording this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:05.900000,00:47:08.800000,,because they put out mic for recording things when,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:08.800000,00:47:11.300000,all right I pulled up the calculator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:11.300000,00:47:11.900000,let's go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:11.900000,00:47:14.300000,all right so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:14.600000,00:47:16,,is that hard for you to figure out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:16,00:47:19.500000,,it's only eighteen it's eighteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:19.500000,00:47:26.700000,no it's actually point zero six four is five one one six one two nine zero three two two five eight one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:28.500000,00:47:28.800000,,what,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:29.500000,00:47:31.100000,that's actually what it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:31.100000,00:47:32.400000,that's what says on my calculator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:33.300000,00:47:33.700000,,oh wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:34.500000,00:47:35.900000,,well I'm thinking eighteen here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:35.900000,00:47:38.200000,,because I don't have any decimal things or none before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:38.200000,00:47:40.600000,okay it's eighteen k equals eighteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:40.600000,00:47:41.600000,all right we did it yay ops,,,,,,,,,,,,,LPB,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:41.600000,00:47:43.800000,,oh there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:47:43.900000,00:47:57.300000,,now this one pause filler I'm going to give you a little pause filler sneak peak here in order to get this out pretty fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:47:43.900000,00:50:58.900000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:47:57.300000,00:48:01,,you're going to multiply each sides by y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:47:57.300000,00:48:01,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:01,00:48:02.900000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:01,00:48:02.900000,,so this y cancels out y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:02.900000,00:48:09.800000,,and you actually are going to add a y what y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:02.900000,00:48:09.800000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:10.200000,00:48:10.500000,no no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:10.900000,00:48:11.400000,there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:11.400000,00:48:16.200000,,yeah and then we're going to add y to the two ten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:11.400000,00:48:16.200000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:17.500000,00:48:20.200000,,so yeah wait yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:20.200000,00:48:24.400000,,so then you basically know what pause filler you get there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:25.300000,00:48:28.300000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:48:25.300000,00:48:28.300000,,and then all you need to do is just simplify the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:48:33.600000,00:48:34,,oh okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:48:36.100000,00:48:36.900000,I'm just using the highlighter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:48:39.900000,00:48:40.500000,hold on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:48:42.800000,00:48:49.500000,no I don't want to go in Scribblar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:48:47,00:48:47.300000,,(laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:48:49.800000,00:48:53.900000,all right please undo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:48:57.300000,00:49:02.400000,no apparently this is another glitch where it won't erase this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:02.400000,00:49:03.500000,so I'm just going to do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:03.500000,00:49:09.200000,all right all right so I think what you're missing here is that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:09.500000,00:49:13.500000,we have to put the y here and the negative fourteen there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:14.600000,00:49:16.800000,,well actually if you would do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:14.600000,00:49:16.800000,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:17.400000,00:49:19.700000,,you would have fourteen y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:17.400000,00:49:19.700000,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:19.800000,00:49:22.700000,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:19.800000,00:49:22.700000,,but negative fourteen y was negative fourteen y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:23.600000,00:49:24.700000,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:25.500000,00:49:27.800000,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,2,00:49:25.500000,00:49:27.800000,,so if you were actually to multiply the ys here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:29.600000,00:49:33.100000,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:29.600000,00:49:33.100000,,they would cancel out for some reason I do not know the whereabouts of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:34.400000,00:49:36.800000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:34.400000,00:49:36.800000,,and you just multiply it here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:36.800000,00:49:37.400000,,and you get y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:36.800000,00:49:37.400000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:37.400000,00:49:39.800000,all righty then pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:41,00:49:44.400000,,only if it works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:44.500000,00:49:47.300000,,only if this explain to me why what happened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:47.700000,00:49:51,,I would understand it better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:51.200000,00:49:53,pause filler well these are college students,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:53,00:49:55.900000,and they just rigged this up just for us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,7,00:49:56.100000,00:49:57.200000,,yay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:49:57.200000,00:50:00.800000,all right and then we put y here right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:50:01.100000,00:50:01.500000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:50:02.500000,00:50:05.800000,all right and then I do that's a perfect one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:50:06.800000,00:50:10.200000,,yeah that actually is that's a pretty decent line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:50:10.200000,00:50:12.900000,,I don't see any curves or anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:50:16.600000,00:50:22.200000,and then what you do here is negative fourteen negative fourteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:50:23.500000,00:50:28.300000,calculator calculator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:50:28.600000,00:50:31.100000,,honestly I don't even know the answer to this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:50:31.200000,00:50:35.400000,,but I do have a sort of answer to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:50:36.700000,00:50:41.700000,all right so it's two ten divided by four two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:50:43.200000,00:50:43.900000,,negative fourteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:50:43.900000,00:50:46.700000,so I got fifteen negative fifteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:50:46.900000,00:50:49.500000,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:50:46.900000,00:50:49.500000,,yeah so you have negative fifteen equals y yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:50:52.800000,00:50:54,oh yeah look at that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:50:54.400000,00:50:57.300000,oh yeah oh (sfx),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:03.100000,00:51:07,I have another basic understanding of what I'm supposed to do here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:07,00:51:08.700000,so I'm just going to talk while I work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:09.200000,00:51:12.500000,all right so this goes off like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:12.500000,00:51:15.500000,these easy problems are giving us more opportunities to talk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:15.500000,00:51:15.900000,thanks CMU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,

5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:18.600000,00:51:21,,you make confusing equipment but easy math problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:21,00:51:26.700000,yeah like you have like robots in the room next to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:26.700000,00:51:29.600000,but in the next room you're teaching a kid how to do math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:30.400000,00:51:30.900000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:30.900000,00:51:35.200000,oh this is wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:37.400000,00:51:39.900000,,yeah I was starting to wonder what was going on there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:40,00:51:43,yeah (inaudible) pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:40,00:51:46.100000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:40,00:51:46.100000,,so the next five up there right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:47.400000,00:51:48,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:48.800000,00:51:51.300000,,so here's one thing I notice you're getting confused at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:48.800000,00:51:51.300000,,,,,,,,,,,MCRP,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:51.300000,00:51:53.600000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:51.300000,00:51:53.600000,,what you want to do is that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:53.600000,00:51:55.600000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:53.600000,00:51:55.600000,,you're doing the five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:57.200000,00:51:59.100000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,4,00:51:57.200000,00:51:59.100000,,you want to do this but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:51:59.100000,00:52:04,,,,,,,,,,,MCRP,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:51:59.100000,00:52:04,,and it's hard because for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:04,00:52:05.300000,,,,,,,,,,,MCRP,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:04,00:52:05.300000,,you're not finding any numbers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:05.700000,00:52:07.400000,,but if you were actually to do this that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:05.700000,00:52:07.400000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:07.400000,00:52:08.800000,,so it must be x isn't it,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:09.600000,00:52:10.600000,,I don't know why I put it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:10.600000,00:52:11.200000,that's anx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:12.400000,00:52:18.100000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:12.400000,00:52:18.100000,,yeah so if you were to actually put the problem like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:18.100000,00:52:22,,you would still put a five over what five over x,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:18.100000,00:52:22,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:22.200000,00:52:23.600000,,then the x would care about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:22.200000,00:52:23.600000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:23.600000,00:52:27.800000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:23.600000,00:52:27.800000,,so it would just be one hundred thirty-seven x equals five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:27.800000,00:52:31.800000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:27.800000,00:52:31.800000,,and then it be a lot simpler for you to simplify it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:32,00:52:36.600000,,so with that I think if you were to start pause filler the space the problems like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:32,00:52:36.600000,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:36.600000,00:52:38.500000,,you'll be able to get passed them pretty fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:36.600000,00:52:38.500000,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:38.500000,00:52:48.200000,all right so pause filler it just be times x right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:49.500000,00:52:51.800000,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:49.500000,00:52:51.800000,,yeah so one over x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:51.800000,00:52:53,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:51.800000,00:52:53,,or x times x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,5,00:52:53.400000,00:52:56,,it doesn't matter whichever way of those you put it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:52:59.700000,00:53:00.200000,right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:53:00.700000,00:53:03.500000,,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:53:00.700000,00:53:03.500000,,yeah so that's also correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:53:03.900000,00:53:10.500000,,and your outcome is for this part here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:53:11.900000,00:53:16.900000,,so it's one thirty-seven x equals five yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:53:11.900000,00:53:16.900000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:53:16.900000,00:53:23.900000,all right pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,3,00:53:24.400000,00:53:36.700000,one hundred and thirty-seven pause filler equals oh god my brain is like melting now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
5,2,T2 ,,,3,00:53:37.200000,00:53:40.800000,,yeah okay I can just see how tired you are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,3,00:53:41.800000,00:53:42,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,3,00:53:42,00:53:55.500000,all right and then five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:53:55.500000,00:54:00.200000,yeah yeah (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:54:00.200000,00:54:02.400000,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:54:00.200000,00:54:02.400000,,also you might forgot a little something there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:54:03.300000,00:54:03.900000,what,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:54:04.700000,00:54:06.300000,oh yeah there's an x there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:54:06.300000,00:54:07.300000,yeah yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:54:08.100000,00:54:08.200000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:54:08.400000,00:54:09.600000,,so yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:54:09.600000,00:54:12.200000,,then once you get all this you just got to simplify it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:54:09.600000,00:54:12.200000,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2,T2 ,,,6,00:54:12.200000,00:54:14.800000,,and then the whole thing becomes very very easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,1,T1 ,,,1,00:21:31.800000,00:21:40.100000,and so you have wait what negative nine equals,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,1,00:21:41.400000,00:21:44,,and then you can add the nine right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,5,00:21:45.600000,00:21:47.100000,well you have the twenty-seven to the other side right,,,,,CA,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

6,1,T1 ,,,4,00:22:28.500000,00:22:39,,and then you get y equals negative five oh what was really really not that hard okay,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,4,00:22:39.500000,00:22:42.200000,,so I would personally subtract the nineteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

6,1,T1 ,,,4,00:23:20,00:23:21.200000,one second pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,4,00:23:23.700000,00:23:25,,it's a fraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,4,00:23:25,00:23:26.100000,,but I made it that small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,4,00:23:26.100000,00:23:27.700000,,because I feel like being fancy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,4,00:23:30.400000,00:23:33.600000,,because one fifth is zero point two,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,4,00:23:34,00:23:36.600000,,I think I'm finally figuring out how to write with this thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,1,T1 ,,,2,00:24:59.500000,00:24:59.700000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,2,00:25:02.100000,00:25:06.900000,so I started by subtracting the twenty-eight d from the fifty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,1,00:25:06.900000,00:25:21.200000,so fifty-three minus twenty-eight equals twenty-five right,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,1,00:25:21.200000,00:25:25.800000,and then you have twenty-five d,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,1,00:25:26.700000,00:25:26.800000,,right,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,1,00:25:26.900000,00:25:28.200000,and then you do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,1,00:25:28.400000,00:25:30.900000,you subtract the seventy from that side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,1,00:25:30.900000,00:25:42.300000,and then you do seventy minus nineteen equals pause filler fifty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,5,00:25:43,00:25:45.900000,so thatÀ_s negative fifty-one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,5,00:25:46.400000,00:25:48.900000,,the time on my computer is really off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,1,T1 ,,,5,00:25:51.200000,00:25:53.600000,,six zero five and then it's five thirty-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,5,00:25:53.600000,00:25:53.700000,thatÀ_s a (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,5,00:25:54.100000,00:26:04.600000,and then d equals negative fifty-one twenty-five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,5,00:26:06.100000,00:26:11.100000,or that equals negative two one,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T1 ,,,5,00:26:12.500000,00:26:13.400000,thatÀ_s what I got,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,1,T2 ,,,2,00:36:50.200000,00:36:54.100000,,such a rebel let's so then you have to add fourteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,2,00:36:54.100000,00:37:00.900000,,so you get negative k equals fifty plus k wait oh my,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,2,00:37:01,00:37:02.300000,,and then you subtract k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,2,00:37:02.300000,00:37:03.700000,,and then you subtract k again,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,2,00:37:04,00:37:06.900000,,so negative two k equals fifty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,2,00:37:06.900000,00:37:09,,and then you just divide out by a negative two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,2,00:37:09,00:37:09.300000,two yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,0,00:37:09.300000,00:37:14.800000,,and then k is negative twenty-five whoa like math,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,

6,1,T2 ,,,4,00:40:35.700000,00:40:39.100000,,thirty-six so when you get four equals p,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:40:41.200000,00:40:53,,yeah math so this is so challenging plus one forty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:40:53,00:41:07.100000,,so you get negative fourteen w equals one hundred and sixty plus twenty-six w minus twenty-six w minus twenty-six w which is forty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,10,2.0,3,00:40:53,00:41:23.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:14.100000,00:49:23.600000,,okay thirty-three and then you get negative two hundred equals one hundred x,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:23.600000,00:49:25.800000,,and then negative two equals x,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:25.800000,00:49:27,,long story short there you go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,4,00:49:28.800000,00:49:30.800000,okay I lost my tenth drawing here (inaudible) but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:49:44.200000,00:49:49.100000,,but Harry Potter happens to not be one of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:49:54.400000,00:50:06.900000,,forty-two forty-one yup forty-one y plus thirty-seven minus thirty-seven y you add the thirty-seven just to subtract it,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:50:07,00:50:07.300000,,okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,17,1.0,4,00:50:07.200000,00:50:34.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:07.300000,00:50:14.400000,,so that would be twelve equals forty-one y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:14.500000,00:50:21.100000,,and then you just get twelve forty-first equals one op,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
6,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:21.100000,00:50:26.900000,oh this has so many numbers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:26.900000,00:50:34.300000,,oh math in general (inaudible) there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,18,1.0,5,00:50:34.600000,00:51:32.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,4,00:50:34.600000,00:50:43.300000,,okay I guess I'll start with subtracting sixty-one,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,0,00:50:45.800000,00:50:46.100000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,0,00:50:47.100000,00:50:56.100000,,so then you would get two hundred and six minus thirty-three z,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,0,00:50:57.700000,00:50:59.900000,,ah this (inaudible) you like writing calligraphy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,1,T2 ,,,0,00:51:03.700000,00:51:13.600000,,so that would be sixty-seven two hundred and sixty-seven equals one,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:51:13.600000,00:51:18.800000,,oh my god one hundred and thirty-four z divide out,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:51:19.100000,00:51:20.900000,,divide out long story shorter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:51:20.900000,00:51:24.600000,,it ends up being like two or something right I donÀ_t,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:51:27.200000,00:51:31.600000,,yeah or no it would be like one and one hundred something,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,19,0.0,0,00:51:33,00:52:57.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:51:33.200000,00:51:36.400000,,okay no thatÀ_s a lot of numbers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:51:39,00:51:42.800000,,pause filler I don't know what I'm doing,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,6,00:51:42.900000,00:51:52.200000,well you could start by subtracting the fifty or adding these,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,6,00:51:53.300000,00:51:54.300000,,or I'll subtract,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,6,00:51:54.300000,00:51:55.900000,,yeah thatÀ_s a good idea thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,LP,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,6,00:51:56,00:52:04.600000,,negative sixty p minus one hundred and forty equals negative fifteen p plus fifty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,6,00:52:04.900000,00:52:10,,so then you can add forty to both side one forty thank you one forty to both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:52:10,00:52:20.500000,,so then you get negative sixty p equals negative fifteen p plus ninety no one hundred and ninety,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:52:20.700000,00:52:26.500000,,and then add fifteen p,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:52:26.500000,00:52:30.800000,,so then you get seventy negative no wait,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:52:32.100000,00:52:33,,wait just fix up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,5,00:52:33,00:52:39,,you get negative forty-five p equals one hundred and ninety,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,0,00:52:39,00:52:45.700000,,and then divided out by forty-five divided by forty-five,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,0,00:52:45.700000,00:52:51.300000,,I want to say forty-five times like four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,0,00:52:51.300000,00:52:57,,no not four it would be two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,20,2.0,4,00:52:58,00:53:17.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,0,00:52:58.400000,00:53:02,wait so you have negative forty-five r equals a hundred ninety and then,,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,1,T2 ,,,0,00:53:02,00:53:11.300000,,so actually you get four and two ninths negative four and two ninths equals r (sfx),,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,

6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:38:52.100000,00:38:55.700000,and then you multiply by x multiply by x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:38:55.700000,00:39:03.400000,and x times x is x squared equals twelve over x squared plus eighteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:39:03.600000,00:39:07.500000,and then you got to multiply by x squared again to cancel out,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:39:07.700000,00:39:10,okay I did this in my homework the other day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:39:11,00:39:14.800000,x squared equals twelve plus eighteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

6,2,T2 ,,,3,00:39:41.200000,00:39:43,so then you get one zero three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,3,00:39:45.400000,00:39:50.900000,one zero three plus twelve x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

6,2,T2 ,8,0.0,6,00:40:38,00:41:23.600000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:40:38.300000,00:40:41.900000,so you would subtract twenty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:40:43.700000,00:40:46.200000,subtract twenty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:40:46.200000,00:40:52.400000,so you got one over x plus forty-five equals that,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:40:52.400000,00:40:54.200000,,no it should be thirty-five,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:40:54.800000,00:40:56,oh yup you're right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:40:56,00:40:56.500000,you're right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:40:56.900000,00:40:59.600000,thank you tutor for math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:41:00.600000,00:41:07.200000,so I guess you could just really subtract one over x minus one over thirty-five equals eight over x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:41:07.200000,00:41:11.300000,then you get thirty-five x equals eight,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:41:11.300000,00:41:12.600000,and then you get,,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:41:13.100000,00:41:16.200000,,x equals eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:41:16.200000,00:41:18.600000,eight thirty fifth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:41:19.900000,00:41:20.200000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:41:21.100000,00:41:24.200000,that's right because I don't even know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:41:24.800000,00:41:27.700000,,okay and then what do you do first,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:41:27.700000,00:41:31.500000,you add one ninety-two both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:41:31.500000,00:41:39.400000,this is the x equals scruples,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:40.300000,00:41:40.900000,,wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:40.900000,00:41:42.100000,,pause filler that's really nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:42.200000,00:41:47.500000,I think that should be qualified as a legitimate answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:47.500000,00:41:55.500000,all right and this is what happens when I'm tired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
6,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:56.100000,00:41:58,,okay you add the one ninety,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,5,00:41:58,00:42:05.400000,,and that equals like three hundred forty if you plan on doing that first yeah,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:42:06.700000,00:42:12.500000,and then negative fix x plus six x is x equals one x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:42:12.500000,00:42:13.600000,(inaudible) I don't even know (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:42:13.600000,00:42:21.700000,so then you get oh wait no you have to subtract this you get negative eleven x to this equals three hundred and forty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:42:21.700000,00:42:25.300000,and then you get negative eleven equals three hundred and forty x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:42:25.300000,00:42:28.400000,and you get eleven three hundred and forty x,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,6,00:42:28.400000,00:42:29.500000,but it's negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:42.300000,00:43:47,,so I like five fifty-seven they should come and get us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:47,00:43:51,,so that's how much longer we have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:53,00:43:55.300000,,boom let's go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,5,00:43:57,00:43:57.100000,,math (sfx),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,2,T2 ,,,1,00:44:30.500000,00:44:34,x plus thirty-eight how do you,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,1,00:44:34.100000,00:44:37.300000,so first of all you got to multiply it by x plus thirty,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,1,00:44:37.400000,00:44:38.400000,cancel it out,,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,1,00:44:39,00:44:39.300000,,yeah,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,3,00:44:40.200000,00:44:44.300000,so that would be negative two equals seventy-three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,3,00:44:45.300000,00:44:49.100000,you could distribute with that some kind of boring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,IDQ
6,2,T2 ,,,3,00:44:53.400000,00:45:04.400000,negative forty equals seventy-three x I'm going to do it on seventy-three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,3,00:45:04.400000,00:45:08.100000,and here is your answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,,,4,00:45:08.300000,00:45:10.500000,all right let's go to the next problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,2,T2 ,13,1.0,1,00:45:08.500000,00:46:57.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:20:44.700000,00:20:46.200000,yeah which would equal nine so,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:20:46.200000,00:20:48.500000,,well wait negative nine plus nine,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:20:53,00:20:58.900000,well anyway you want to make that nine to a positive,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:20:59.100000,00:21:01.600000,so I don't know how to do that,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,SV,,,

7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:21:21.300000,00:21:24.100000,okay let's go back to the point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:21:24.100000,00:21:28.800000,so what you want to do is you want to pause filler make that nine a positive,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:21:29.500000,00:21:30.700000,,a positive so,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:21:31.100000,00:21:34.400000,yes so positive nine negative,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:21:34.600000,00:21:37.400000,,so add eighteen and then,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:21:37.400000,00:21:45.700000,I'm going to replace this because this makes no sense (sfx) (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:21:45.700000,00:21:50.700000,,you just erased the problem (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:21:50.700000,00:21:51.200000,ops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,

7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:21:55.100000,00:21:56.200000,,and you probably yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,IDQ,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:21:56.200000,00:21:56.700000,,oh gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:21:58.500000,00:21:59.400000,,just like undo it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:22:01.200000,00:22:03,,there we are okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:22:03.100000,00:22:03.900000,ah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:22:04.100000,00:22:09.900000,,so are we trying to so how do you get the negative nine to a nine a positive,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:10.500000,00:22:13.600000,,so you add eighteen wait because that would get you there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:13.600000,00:22:18.700000,no you have to keep the nine,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:18.700000,00:22:20.800000,so just do nine plus thirteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:21.300000,00:22:21.700000,,negative nine,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:22.100000,00:22:23.400000,no positive nine,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:23.700000,00:22:25.200000,,but this is a negative nine,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:25.200000,00:22:25.600000,,what do you mean,,AE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:25.600000,00:22:29.600000,yeah just I think don't you add it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:29.800000,00:22:33.600000,,I think you add nine because then that will cancel out like positive and,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:33.600000,00:22:34.100000,yeah add it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:34.100000,00:22:36.100000,,so then that would be zero and so then,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,7,00:22:37.500000,00:22:38.100000,no really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:22:38.500000,00:22:44.300000,,yeah because if you add negative nine and then a positive nine like they cancel out,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:22:44.300000,00:22:46.800000,,and just equal zero I think,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDS,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:22:47.700000,00:22:50,maybe well I know so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:22:50,00:22:52,,(inaudible) and then you add listen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:22:52,00:22:54.900000,,and then if you do one thing to one side you have to do it to the other,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:22:54.900000,00:22:56.700000,,so you have to add nine to the side I think,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:22:59.500000,00:23:03,yeah you have to add nine to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:23:03,00:23:03.500000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:23:03.800000,00:23:10.900000,and then you get the pause filler variable and the number together,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:11.100000,00:23:13.100000,and then it has one number on the other side,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:13.900000,00:23:16.900000,,so this is fifty and then this is,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:16.900000,00:23:17,good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:17,00:23:18.600000,oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:18.600000,00:23:19.800000,okay I get it,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:19.800000,00:23:20.500000,I get it,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:20.500000,00:23:25.200000,okay so what you want to do is so you cancel out that nine,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:25.200000,00:23:29.200000,and then you add that nine where you got it,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:29.200000,00:23:30.400000,,so then forty-nine right,,,,CA,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:30.400000,00:23:34.300000,no you add it to thirteen and forty-one,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:34.800000,00:23:38.700000,,wait so you add the nine to the thirteen and then negative nine and forty-one,,,,CA,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:38.800000,00:23:39.200000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:23:39.900000,00:23:40.600000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:23:41.400000,00:23:43.800000,so you want to add it to both sides,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:23:45.300000,00:23:49.300000,,but like but thirteen p is on the same side as negative nine,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:23:50,00:23:50.900000,well that's separate,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:23:50.900000,00:23:52.200000,that's like separate somehow,,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:23:52.500000,00:23:55.900000,okay but like the paper says that it's separate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:23:55.900000,00:23:59.600000,I don't know how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:23:59.600000,00:24:00.900000,confusing okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:24:01.300000,00:24:07.400000,,all right what does the paper say,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,6,00:24:08.300000,00:24:09.300000,,so the I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,1,00:24:09.800000,00:24:12,it's not the exact answer to that so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,1,00:24:12,00:24:12.800000,,well yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,1,00:24:13.200000,00:24:15.100000,it's a different equation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,1,00:24:15.700000,00:24:19.800000,so what I'm doing is I'm just switching up the numbers and variable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,1,00:24:20.400000,00:24:29.300000,okay so what it says to do here is so you got thirteen p equals fifty,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,1,00:24:30.200000,00:24:33.600000,so that is probably correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,1,00:24:34,00:24:34.800000,I have no idea,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,1,00:24:34.800000,00:24:38.600000,,yeah but do we have to do we have to simplify it down to one p,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,0,00:24:39.800000,00:24:42.200000,no not yet,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,0,00:24:42.200000,00:24:45.400000,okay so then you want to divide,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,0,00:24:45.600000,00:24:45.800000,,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,0,00:24:45.800000,00:24:50,thirteen divided b thirteen divide and then,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,0,00:24:50,00:24:52.400000,,and then fifty divided by thirteen,,,,CA,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,0,00:24:52.400000,00:24:52.600000,no,,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,0,00:24:53.400000,00:24:56.500000,you want to divide well yeah technically,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,0,00:24:56.500000,00:24:56.800000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,0,00:24:57.600000,00:25:03.600000,and that equals pause filler the p equals whatever,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:25:03.800000,00:25:12.500000,,fifteen divided by thirteen is right so because if you do or now we do thirteen p divided thirteen which is p,,,,CA,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T1 ,5,1.0,5,00:25:13.500000,00:25:14.200000,,I think yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,

7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:36:15.100000,00:36:18.400000,wait well then that would be eighteen yeah wait,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:36:18.400000,00:36:24.200000,,yeah because it would cancel out because the negative y and the positive y just makes zero oh,,,,,,EV,,CF,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:36:26.800000,00:36:27.800000,now wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,1,00:36:48.100000,00:36:50,and we're only like twenty year olds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,1,00:36:50,00:36:51.900000,it's like hi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,1,00:36:51.900000,00:36:56.500000,and I don't know you this is really scary okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,1,00:36:56.800000,00:37:04.100000,,all right so if you added y to both sides the ys,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,1,00:37:04.200000,00:37:08.200000,I think it's adding eighteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:37:10,00:37:20.700000,,well because if you added y to both sides then you would because you can have the negative y I don't think,,,,,,EV,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:37:21.400000,00:37:27,,like because then if you add y to both sides,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:37:27,00:37:34.500000,,then pause filler then this the y on this side will become just zero,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:37:34.500000,00:37:37.900000,,sort of like have with the nine it's like you have negative nine plus nine equals zero,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,4,00:37:37.900000,00:37:48.700000,,and then this will just become twenty-three plus y equals eighteen oh (laughter) plus y equals eighteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,4,00:37:48.700000,00:37:53.200000,,and then like and then you could probably subtract twenty-three from each side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,4,00:37:55.200000,00:37:55.600000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:12.300000,00:39:15.200000,,so if we add y to the side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:15.200000,00:39:18.900000,,and we add y to the other side as well,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:18.900000,00:39:20.500000,,what do we have,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:38,00:39:41.300000,okay so I don't think we add y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:42.200000,00:39:45.900000,I think we only add y once,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:46.500000,00:39:48.900000,and then it's eighteen plus twenty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:52.300000,00:39:53.100000,,but yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:39:56.400000,00:39:59.400000,I'm like explaining the problem now (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:40:00.700000,00:40:07.600000,okay so negative y plus eighteen equals twenty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:40:08.100000,00:40:08.600000,,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:40:13.200000,00:40:14.400000,it's the problem up here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:40:14.700000,00:40:16.300000,,oh yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:40:16.300000,00:40:22.600000,,(laughter) I was like where did that come from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:40:23.100000,00:40:28.600000,okay so we would subtract y from eighteen negative y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:40:31,00:40:39.300000,and then we would equal twenty-three plus eighteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:42.800000,00:40:46.600000,,but on here they have like the same form,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:46.600000,00:40:53,,and they add like y first like,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:53,00:40:56.600000,,around here we're pause filler it's like the same thing with different numbers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:40:57.500000,00:41:00.700000,,they just added like the number they've added like the x first,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:41:02.700000,00:41:03.600000,,and then they add,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:41:03.600000,00:41:08.800000,,and then they subtracted the number so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:41:10.700000,00:41:17.500000,so then it would be eighteen y,,,,,CA,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:41:17.500000,00:41:19.400000,,what do you mean (laughter),AE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:41:19.400000,00:41:21.800000,y plus eighteen equals eighteen y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:41:22.300000,00:41:23,,negative y,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:41:23.100000,00:41:24,,remember it's negative,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:41:27.100000,00:41:28.700000,then negative eighteen y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:41:29.200000,00:41:29.700000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:41:30,00:41:38.500000,,all right negative yeah eighteen negative y what because like no y has to be positive,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,2,00:41:42.900000,00:41:43.200000,,doesn't it,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:42:10.300000,00:42:14.700000,,okay so let's try like what I see on the paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:42:14.700000,00:42:23.400000,,so let's try plus y on the side plus y on this side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,5,00:42:23.800000,00:42:26.600000,don't you want to make the ink a little smaller,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,

7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:42:35.200000,00:42:42.500000,,so now so if we add y on both sides what do we have,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:42:42.700000,00:42:48.900000,pause filler so well this is zero,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:42:48.900000,00:42:51.100000,,yeah that would cancel out,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:42:51.600000,00:42:54.100000,and this is eighteen y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:42:54.400000,00:42:54.800000,,so no,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:42:58.200000,00:43:03,,you wouldn't need the eighteen because you would add by each side,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:43:03,00:43:06,,so you would add y to each side of the equation,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:43:06,00:43:06.800000,,so you would add y to,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:43:06.800000,00:43:07.400000,oh twenty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:43:07.400000,00:43:09,it's twenty-three y,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:43:09.500000,00:43:10.700000,,twenty-three plus y yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:43:12.500000,00:43:19.600000,,so now it's going to be eighteen because it equals twenty-three plus y,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,3,00:43:23.500000,00:43:24.100000,,and then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:43:46.400000,00:43:53,,we can cancel out the twenty-three,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:43:53,00:43:57.500000,,and then so we have y alone by subtracting twenty-three from each side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,2,0.0,0,00:43:57.500000,00:44:00.100000,,so do that and then yeah,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:46:36.700000,00:46:37.600000,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:46:37.800000,00:46:43.200000,,start by (laughter) adding k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:46:43.200000,00:46:47.600000,,try adding k to each side of the equation,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:46:48.900000,00:46:51.600000,that's pretty much getting rid of the ks,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:46:51.600000,00:46:54.200000,,well if you add k to this side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:46:55,00:46:56.400000,,and you add k to this side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:46:57.700000,00:46:59.300000,,this will be canceled out,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:46:59.300000,00:47:00,,and just be zero,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:47:00,00:47:05.600000,,so it will be negative fourteen equals thirty-six,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:47:05.600000,00:47:09.400000,,and then since we add another k to the k it would be plus two k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,Na,00:49:40.200000,00:49:53.900000,,(laughter) if we added k to each side the left side of the equation would be fourteen negative fourteen because the other side cancels out because the ks cancel out,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,Na,00:49:54.700000,00:49:56.700000,,and in the other side would be thirty-six,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
7,1,T2 ,3,0.0,Na,00:49:56.900000,00:50:00,,and then plus two k now that we added another k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T1 ,1,1.0,2,00:19:05.500000,00:19:10.900000,,yeah so two eighty over three equals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,1,1.0,2,00:19:12,00:19:12.300000,,pause filler wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,1,1.0,6,00:19:12.500000,00:19:15.200000,wait no that's the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,1,1.0,6,00:19:15.200000,00:19:19.900000,,wait is it pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T1 ,1,1.0,5,00:20:03.200000,00:20:05,,or should we just keep the fraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T1 ,1,1.0,5,00:20:05.400000,00:20:08.200000,,or do we have to divide it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:22:38.500000,00:22:43,,and then since you added eighteen to the negative eighteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:22:43.300000,00:22:45.500000,,it's then just negative two y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:22:45.500000,00:22:48,,it's negative two over three y (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:03.900000,00:23:05,,I know that's not the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:05.100000,00:23:07.200000,,but then do we do three over negative pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:07.300000,00:23:10.400000,oh I know the I don't know the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:10.400000,00:23:13,but I know what to do next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:23:13,00:23:17.400000,okay do you want the next pause filler thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDE
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:23:18.700000,00:23:21.800000,,should we just like finish this one though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:23:23.100000,00:23:26,so did you add eighteen to both sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:23:27.100000,00:23:28.200000,,pause filler yeah and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:23:28.200000,00:23:30.200000,eighteen plus fifty-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:23:30.800000,00:23:31.600000,,is seventy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:23:31.600000,00:23:32.400000,,yeah I got that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,5,00:23:33.500000,00:23:41.200000,okay so then you have to take the excuse me pause filler to the fraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:41.200000,00:23:44.700000,and then you have to multiply it on both sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:46.500000,00:23:48.400000,,again like we did the last one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:48.400000,00:23:51.300000,but you have to make it inproper so flip it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:51.900000,00:23:56.900000,,okay okay so negative three over two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:56.900000,00:23:58.400000,,so that would cancel out right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:23:58.800000,00:23:59.700000,wait hold up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:24:00.200000,00:24:04,,if I did negative two over three time three negative three over two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T1 ,3,1.0,2,00:24:04,00:24:05.800000,,that would cancel out right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:35:26.100000,00:35:31.400000,,and then you multiply x each side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:35:33.500000,00:35:36.900000,the x on the bottom of the fraction goes away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:36:20.100000,00:36:28.200000,,no because you want to get x alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:36:28.600000,00:36:32.400000,,so maybe if you divide each side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:36:33.200000,00:36:34.900000,,yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:36:35,00:36:38.200000,,you have to divide each side by twenty-five because then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:36:38.300000,00:36:43.100000,,x on this side is going to just is going to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,

7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:37:00.500000,00:37:02.100000,,if we divide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,3,00:37:04.300000,00:37:05.500000,you're like wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,

7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:34.400000,00:37:40.300000,,but okay so if we divide each side by twenty-five so because then what will happen to this side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:40.300000,00:37:41.600000,,is it will just be x alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:41.600000,00:37:43,,and that will be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:43,00:37:44.100000,,what will that be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:45.700000,00:37:46.400000,onex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:46.900000,00:37:48,,one over twenty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:48.200000,00:37:51.300000,,because if we're dividing this by twenty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:51.600000,00:37:54.400000,,then it will be one divided by twenty-five which is that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:54.400000,00:37:56.200000,,and then divide that by twenty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:56.400000,00:37:58.700000,,and then it's just going to be x alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:37:58.700000,00:38:00.800000,,so whatever twenty-five equals x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,1,1.0,2,00:38:04.300000,00:38:05.200000,,I have two left,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,

7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,0,00:40:41.500000,00:40:45.800000,,so if you multiply negative three over y not by x by y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,0,00:40:46.100000,00:40:49.700000,,if we do negative three over y times y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,0,00:41:01.400000,00:41:03.100000,,so here write down negative three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,0,00:41:03.100000,00:41:07.300000,,because if we so if we do negative y times negative three over y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,0,00:41:07.500000,00:41:09.600000,,so just write negative three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:41:09.700000,00:41:14,,and then just write eighty times y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,

7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:41:20.800000,00:41:22.500000,,okay I was like no it's not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:41:22.500000,00:41:24,,it's going to be so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:41:24,00:41:28,,right now this is not not the mechanical pencil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:41:28,00:41:35.900000,,so right now it's negative three equals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:41:36.100000,00:41:41.400000,,negative three equals eighty eighty x eighty y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:41:41.400000,00:41:44.700000,,and then what we do is we divide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:41:45.100000,00:41:47.500000,,if we want to get y alone what do we do,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:41:49.900000,00:41:52.800000,you have to subtract or add,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:41:53,00:41:56.600000,,no you have to divide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:41:57.200000,00:41:58.100000,what you said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:41:58.700000,00:41:59.100000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:41:59.400000,00:42:05.200000,,so then what we're going to so we have negative three equals eighty pause filler y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:42:05.300000,00:42:07.700000,,so then we're going to divide by eighty on each side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:08.200000,00:42:14.100000,,and so it's going to be negative pause filler three over eighty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:14.200000,00:42:16.100000,,because if we're dividing that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:16.100000,00:42:19.500000,,and then since we divided the other side by eighty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:20.100000,00:42:23.700000,,it's going to be pause filler it's just going to be y now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:24.600000,00:42:26.700000,,so what's it all equal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:29.800000,00:42:30.700000,you stumped me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:31.500000,00:42:32.400000,,I stumped you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:33.300000,00:42:34.800000,I have no idea where you are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:35.700000,00:42:38.300000,,okay let me explain everything we did okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:39.300000,00:42:41.700000,,just like I don't feel like writing the whole thing again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:42:41.700000,00:42:43.600000,,but I'll just explain it so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:42:43.700000,00:42:45,wait hold on are we here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:42:46.100000,00:42:48.200000,,here do you want me to just go from the very beginning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:42:49.400000,00:42:49.800000,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:42:50.500000,00:42:55.300000,,where did you get lost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:42:55.700000,00:42:58,all of the writing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:42:58.300000,00:42:59.500000,I can't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:42:59.600000,00:43:06.200000,,okay so what we did first is we added eighteen to each side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:43:06.800000,00:43:07.500000,,you know that right,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:43:08,00:43:08.300000,uh-huh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,1,00:43:10,00:43:13.700000,,so then on the left side we have negative three over y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:43:13.700000,00:43:16.700000,,and then on the other side we had eighty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:43:16.700000,00:43:21.100000,,because we added to the seventeen cancelled out yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:43:21.100000,00:43:29.400000,,and then what we did is we divided each side by y yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:43:29.800000,00:43:34.700000,,and then what happened is the negative three over y just became negative three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:43:34.700000,00:43:38.200000,,and six and eighty became eighty times y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:43:38.800000,00:43:42.700000,,so at this point it was negative three equals eighty times y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:43:43.400000,00:43:49,,and then what happened was we divided so we had pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:43:49,00:43:50.500000,,let me just write this out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:43:51,00:43:52.400000,,so we had negative three,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:43:52.400000,00:44:00.200000,,since pause filler negative three equals eighty times y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:01.800000,00:44:03.300000,,oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:04,00:44:04.800000,,eighty times y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:04.800000,00:44:07.700000,,let's just pretend that says eighty times y okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:08.200000,00:44:13.100000,,because we got there because we had multiplied times y on each side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:13.100000,00:44:15.700000,,and it became negative three equals eighty y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:15.800000,00:44:16.700000,,you get that,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:19.700000,00:44:20.200000,,you get that,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:20.800000,00:44:21.500000,,you get that,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:21.700000,00:44:22.300000,,you get that,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:22.300000,00:44:23.200000,,you get that,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:24,00:44:24.500000,hold up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:24.500000,00:44:25.700000,go back to eighty times y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:25.700000,00:44:26.900000,what does it equal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:28.500000,00:44:30.200000,,we don't do eighty times y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:30.600000,00:44:32.400000,,what we do next is the fourth like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:32.800000,00:44:34.400000,,we want to get y alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:34.400000,00:44:36.200000,,and right now y is with eighty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:36.200000,00:44:37.500000,,so you have to divide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,5,00:44:37.700000,00:44:43.500000,,if you do eighty if eighty times y if you do eighty times y divided by eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:44:43.500000,00:44:45.600000,,it just becomes y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:44:45.600000,00:44:49.500000,,because the eighty divided eighty just cancels out and then becomes y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:44:49.700000,00:44:50.800000,,so you get that,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:44:51.300000,00:44:51.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:44:52.400000,00:44:56.600000,,yeah so it's just y on the right side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:44:56.600000,00:45:01.500000,,and then we also have to do pause filler divide eighty on the other side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:45:01.500000,00:45:03.300000,,so then it's just negative three divided by eighty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:45:03.300000,00:45:05.100000,,so the final thing do you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:45:05.200000,00:45:05.900000,,what is it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,2,00:45:08.500000,00:45:10.200000,,negative three over eighty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:45:12.600000,00:45:14.600000,I can't do math that fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:45:14.600000,00:45:18.300000,,no because like what I just said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:45:18.300000,00:45:21,,it's negative three over eighty equals y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:45:21,00:45:24.700000,,oh I've been using the wrong side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:45:24.900000,00:45:27.300000,,I was using the other side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:45:27.300000,00:45:33.100000,,I probably looked like an idiot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,2,1.0,6,00:45:33.100000,00:45:40.600000,,okay do you want to go onto the next one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:45:33.500000,00:50:12.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,0,00:45:40.800000,00:45:44,,how do you like get that away (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:46:29.400000,00:46:33.800000,,so you just subtract fifty-four from each side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:46:33.800000,00:46:39.400000,,because then you'll get rid of the fifty-four on the one side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:46:41.100000,00:46:54.500000,,okay so then it's just yeah four over k equals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:46:54.800000,00:46:59.300000,,and then what is one hundred sixteen minus fifty-four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:46:59.300000,00:47:05,,sixty-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,5,00:47:05,00:47:07.300000,I was about to say that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:47:07.500000,00:47:14.800000,,okay so right now yeah so then what we have to do is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:47:32.500000,00:47:32.900000,,the four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:47:32.900000,00:47:34,,how do you get the four alone,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:47:34,00:47:36.500000,oh I was about to be like I don't get it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:47:36.500000,00:47:38.300000,okay so you have to divide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:47:38.300000,00:47:40.200000,,you have to multiply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:47:43.200000,00:47:44,pause filler okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:47:44.100000,00:47:47.600000,,so you have to do yeah so multiply k by each side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:47:47.600000,00:47:49.900000,,so then on the left side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,3,00:48:07.700000,00:48:13.700000,,so if we multiply k to each side we'll get four all alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:48:13.700000,00:48:15.400000,,and then you'll have sixty-two k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:48:15.600000,00:48:21.600000,,so can you write that down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:48:24.600000,00:48:25.400000,,equals four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:48:32.500000,00:48:33.100000,,okay now we're not done yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:48:34.900000,00:48:36.800000,,what do we have to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:48:36.800000,00:48:37.300000,divide it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:48:37.300000,00:48:39.800000,I have no idea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:48:48,00:49:00.600000,,but what do you think we have to divide it by,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:49:00.800000,00:49:02.200000,,guess what we have to divide it by,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:49:03.500000,00:49:03.900000,four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:49:04.100000,00:49:06,,you can just write it as a fraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:49:06,00:49:07.300000,,you don't have to actually do the thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:49:08.500000,00:49:09,yes I do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,4,00:49:09,00:49:10.200000,,okay if you want to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:49:10.200000,00:49:20,,so then at the end it all just equals k equals four divided by sixty-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:49:20.200000,00:49:20.500000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:50:06.500000,00:50:07.600000,fifteen point five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,6,00:50:07.700000,00:50:11.100000,,all right so then fifteen point five equals k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,3,0.0,2,00:50:14.200000,00:50:14.600000,,what was that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,

7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,2,00:50:27.400000,00:50:30.800000,,let me figure out what we have to do for this just so I can pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,2,00:50:32,00:50:32.300000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,2,00:50:34.900000,00:50:35.900000,,yeah okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,2,00:50:39.100000,00:50:41.900000,,how do I get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:50:43.100000,00:50:45.700000,well I think you have to subtract it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:50:48,00:50:48.900000,,no no no (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:50:48.900000,00:50:50.800000,well then it's multiply or addition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:50:50.800000,00:50:54.900000,,yeah how do we get the negative fourteen all alone,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:50:57.100000,00:50:59.500000,you have to subtract it byy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:50:59.500000,00:51:00.800000,,multiply multiply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:51:00.800000,00:51:01.500000,whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:51:02.300000,00:51:03.300000,multiply by y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:51:03.800000,00:51:05.800000,,so you're going to wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:51:07.300000,00:51:10,,oh that feels good to like take them off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,0,00:51:10.900000,00:51:11.400000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:51:12.200000,00:51:15.700000,,that's the people at school would be like put their heads (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:51:16.100000,00:51:21.800000,,okay so if we did pause filler negative fourteen over y times y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:51:21.800000,00:51:24,,that's going to just equal negative fourteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:51:24,00:51:25.300000,,do you want to write that down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:51:27.700000,00:51:30,,here I'll like write a little arrow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:51:33.900000,00:51:35.600000,,why is this computer so slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:51:35.600000,00:51:49.200000,,okay so then it's just going to be it's two hundred ten pause filler times y is going to equal negative fourteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:51:52,00:51:55.700000,,do you get that,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:51:56.400000,00:51:56.700000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:51:58.300000,00:52:03.900000,,okay so now that we have two hundred ten times y equals fourteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:52:04.400000,00:52:06.700000,,we just have to make y alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,4,00:52:07.800000,00:52:13,so then we have to do y plus y or subtraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:13.400000,00:52:14,,division,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:14,00:52:17.800000,,we have to divide two hundred ten y divided by two hundred ten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:17.800000,00:52:20.100000,,because then it will leave y alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:20.100000,00:52:21.200000,,do you get that,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:22.500000,00:52:25,,so oh my god you just disappeared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,

7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:27.200000,00:52:28.300000,,it like you like disappeared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:28.300000,00:52:30.500000,,like the screen went like blue like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:30.500000,00:52:30.700000,,not blue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:30.700000,00:52:32.800000,,but like it was just like a home screen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:32.800000,00:52:39.800000,,and it was just like I was like what did I do okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,5,00:52:39.800000,00:52:42,,so what's it going to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:52:42.300000,00:52:47.400000,,it's two hundred ten y divided by two hundred ten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:52:48.500000,00:52:49.900000,,so that's just going to be y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:52:49.900000,00:52:53.600000,,and then what's going to happen to the negative fourteen,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:52:55.900000,00:52:57.200000,is that the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:52:57.800000,00:52:58.200000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:52:59.200000,00:52:59.600000,okay (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:53:00.100000,00:53:02.600000,,so what's the full answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:53:03.300000,00:53:04.800000,y equals negative fourteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:53:05.500000,00:53:06.200000,,over,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:53:07.700000,00:53:09.800000,y I have no idea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,1,00:53:10.700000,00:53:11.300000,,two hundred ten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:53:12.100000,00:53:20.900000,,because if we have to divide two hundred ten y pause filler by two hundred ten you also have to do that to the other side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:53:20.900000,00:53:22.500000,,because since we're trying to get y alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:53:22.800000,00:53:26.500000,,so we had to divide two hundred ten to each side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:53:26.800000,00:53:28.900000,,so then the other side just became y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:53:28.900000,00:53:34.200000,,and the other side is now negative fourteen divided by two hundred ten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2,T2 ,4,0.0,6,00:53:36.900000,00:53:38.300000,,you got it,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:09:49.900000,00:10:13.900000,okay so here's a two separate equation,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:10:13,00:10:13.300000,,pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:10:13.900000,00:10:23.700000,so you should do that,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:10:23.700000,00:10:27.800000,so do you know how to do this right,,CU,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:10:27,00:10:34.100000,,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:10:27.800000,00:10:33.500000,yeah so you're not really going to get a whole number,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:10:33.500000,00:10:44,so just kind of tell me what fraction you got at the end was,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:10:44,00:10:44.800000,,pause filler I like this pen (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SV,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:10:44.800000,00:10:59.300000,yeah okay so yeah so let's do it here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:10:59.300000,00:11:01.800000,so you add nine to both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:11:01.800000,00:11:11.400000,and then so you have thirteen p equals fifty,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:11:11.400000,00:11:21.600000,and you got thirteen pause filler end up with p equals fifty divided by thirteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:11:22,00:11:25.600000,and if you want to solve that out or just do that,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:11:25.600000,00:11:29.400000,you don't really have to questions like that,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:11:29.400000,00:11:33,it's either you got a fraction,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:11:33,00:11:33.900000,you should leave it like that,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:11:33.900000,00:11:35.200000,or put it here okay,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:11:35.200000,00:11:38,so next question can you do this please,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8,1,T1 ,6,1.0,5,00:12:03.500000,00:12:35.600000,oh pause filler so try to go back to the one you are pause filler in the first one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,6,1.0,5,00:12:36,00:12:43.900000,,it's four,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,6,1.0,5,00:12:44.400000,00:12:56.100000,awesome okay onto the next question okay so let's work on this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:12:44.700000,00:17:57.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:12:56.100000,00:13:21,seven equals sixteen,,,,,,,,RP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:13:23.700000,00:14:06.400000,,okay this is another one where you're not going to get a whole number,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:14:06.400000,00:14:16,mm-hmm okay so you pause filler what you're doing it's the same it's again probably pretty much the same thing as the one we did earlier it's just pause filler,,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:14:16,00:14:18.600000,,but it works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:14:19,00:14:24.800000,yeah so really it doesn't matter where the k ends,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,1,00:14:24.800000,00:14:28,it just matters where you pause filler,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,1,00:14:28.800000,00:14:32.800000,I mean you just want to have the k by itself on one side,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,1,00:14:33.500000,00:14:42.200000,and so what you want to try to do is you want to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,1,00:14:42.200000,00:14:44.800000,oops sorry you want to get this,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDA
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,1,00:14:44.900000,00:14:49.200000,oops you want to get this over here,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,1,00:14:50.300000,00:14:54.300000,and you want to get that fifteen over here,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:14:55.200000,00:14:58.500000,and so basically when you're working with these you want to pause filler you pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:14:58.500000,00:15:07.400000,it's kind of like an inverse operations inverse order of operations type of thing,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:15:07.400000,00:15:13.700000,so you want to do addition or subtraction first and then multiplication or division,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:15:14.700000,00:15:35.600000,so you're going to start with getting the twenty-two to the other side and then dividing by fifteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:15:37,00:15:38.900000,,(inaudible) should just give us the (inaudible),,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:15:38.900000,00:15:46.500000,yeah or maybe it's like some kind of test or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ/IDE
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:15:46.700000,00:15:50.600000,okay so here we have a negative number here,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:15:51.400000,00:15:53.700000,so you want to add it,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,3,00:15:53.700000,00:15:55.900000,and then you have a multiplication,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:15:55.900000,00:15:59,you want to give so multiply,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:15:59,00:16:05.900000,so you want to divide it,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:16:06.600000,00:16:11.300000,and so this is first,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:16:11.300000,00:16:12.900000,and then this is second,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:16:12.900000,00:16:42.200000,,well it is making me mad,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,SD,,SV,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:16:42.200000,00:16:51.400000,yeah okay so let's do this together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:16:51.400000,00:16:54.500000,so we have twenty-two and some negative,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:16:54.800000,00:16:59.900000,so we want to add twenty-two to both sides so,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:00.300000,00:17:03.200000,and that gets rid of this twenty-two,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:03.200000,00:17:11.300000,and that makes this sixty-two courtesy of this fifteen right here,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:12.300000,00:17:14.400000,and since it's multiplied b k,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:14.400000,00:17:15.800000,you want to divide it,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:17,00:17:22.200000,so you divide sixty-two by fifteen,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:23.100000,00:17:24.200000,and that equals k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:26.300000,00:17:35.300000,,what then k equals pause filler,,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:35.900000,00:17:37.600000,k equals sixty-two,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:37.600000,00:17:44.200000,,k equals sixty-two sixty-two divided by five is like four,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:44.200000,00:17:48.400000,it's divided by fifteen,,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:48.400000,00:17:49.600000,and it's about four yeah,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,4,00:17:50.500000,00:17:51.300000,so that's good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,7,1.0,2,00:17:51.400000,00:17:58.500000,it's four and two fifteens okay so next question,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,8,1.0,2,00:17:58,00:18:16.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,8,1.0,2,00:18:00.500000,00:18:04.800000,okay so this one is also pretty easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,1,T1 ,8,1.0,2,00:18:04.900000,00:18:13.900000,so that's one of the easier ones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,8,1.0,2,00:18:13.900000,00:18:14.400000,,there's three,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,8,1.0,2,00:18:15.200000,00:18:15.900000,what,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,8,1.0,2,00:18:15.900000,00:18:16.500000,,three,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,8,1.0,5,00:18:16.900000,00:18:30.700000,yeah awesome great next question okay that is,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,9,0.0,5,00:18:17,00:18:31.800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,9,0.0,5,00:18:30.700000,00:18:31.500000,,three again,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,9,0.0,5,00:18:31.800000,00:18:46,three yeah well great okay pause filler question is okay,,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,4,00:18:32.100000,00:21:29.500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,5,00:18:47.700000,00:18:50.800000,so you have k on both sides,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,5,00:18:50.800000,00:18:55.100000,so you want to get both of the Ks just to one side,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:18:55.600000,00:18:58.300000,and since you have more Ks over here,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:18:58.300000,00:19:00.700000,you want to get rid of this k,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:01.800000,00:19:05.600000,so since if there's no positive or negative sign next to it,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:05.600000,00:19:07.800000,that means it's positive,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:09.200000,00:19:12.100000,so you would subtract k from both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:13.500000,00:19:20.900000,and so you would have negative ten equals seven k minus sixty-eight,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:21.200000,00:19:40.500000,and then can you work out from there,,CU,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:40.500000,00:19:43.300000,,mm-hmm like add something,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:43.400000,00:19:45.500000,okay so let's close it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:45.700000,00:19:49.900000,so this is negative,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:50,00:19:51.600000,we want to add it to both sides,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:51.600000,00:19:52.800000,so since this is,,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,2,00:19:53.200000,00:19:55.500000,so you add sixty-eight to both sides,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,1,00:19:56.400000,00:19:59.100000,and so you have negative ten on this side,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,1,00:20:00,00:20:04.800000,so that's basically saying sixty-eight plus negative ten is also right,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,1,00:20:05.600000,00:20:11,yeah sixty-eight minus ten is negative ten plus sixty-eight,,,,,,EC,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,1,00:20:11.200000,00:20:21.100000,so you have sixty-eight minus ten equals seven k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,0,00:20:22.200000,00:20:29.200000,and so you have fifty-eight equals seven k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,0,00:20:30.100000,00:20:34.400000,so can you do that,,CU,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,0,00:20:34.900000,00:20:36.600000,,mm-hmm so fifty-eight minus seven k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,10,1.0,0,00:20:37.800000,00:20:39.700000,fifty-eight equals seven k,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

8,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:27:11.600000,00:27:14.300000,so since you have less r on here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:27:14.300000,00:27:15,you just have one r,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:27:15,00:27:17,so you subtract r from this side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:27:18.700000,00:27:20,and subtract r from that side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,1,T1 ,11,1.0,2,00:27:20,00:27:24.200000,and you have negative thirty-three equals r,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:07:34.100000,00:07:34.600000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:07:35.100000,00:07:36.700000,,I don't think you got a whole number,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:07:36.900000,00:07:40.200000,,so just like whatever the fraction is at the end,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:07:40.200000,00:07:42.100000,wouldn't it be like four or something,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDE,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:07:43.200000,00:07:48.200000,,oh I think so because you have so when we divide it by three,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:07:48.200000,00:07:52.400000,,it sounds I can't right on these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:07:52.400000,00:07:58.900000,,pause filler you actually are multiplying it by seven over three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:07:59,00:07:59.600000,,so you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:00.500000,00:08:04.600000,,I should get rid of this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:04.600000,00:08:10.700000,,pause filler forty times seven over three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:12.900000,00:08:13.700000,,equals x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:14.700000,00:08:18.600000,,so x equals two hundred,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:20.300000,00:08:22.400000,so what it would be ninety-three,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:22.400000,00:08:24.700000,,it would be over three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:24.700000,00:08:31.200000,,pause filler it doesn't I don't think it goes into three equally,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:31.200000,00:08:33,,so you just have this is the answer,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:36.200000,00:08:36.900000,two eighty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:37.200000,00:08:38.300000,,two eighty over three,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:39.100000,00:08:41.100000,perfect pause filler I get it now,,,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,1,1.0,Na,00:08:41.300000,00:08:44.500000,,yeah okay so next pause filler same idea,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,2,1.0,2,00:08:41.400000,00:09:22.400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,2,1.0,Na,00:08:45,00:08:45.500000,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:08:46.100000,00:09:00.600000,,so the next one would be,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:09:19,00:09:19.800000,right,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,2,1.0,3,00:09:19.800000,00:09:21,,yup perfect,,,,,,,CF,,,,UL,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,2,1.0,2,00:09:21.600000,00:09:22.100000,,awesome,,,,,,,,,,,UL,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,2,1.0,2,00:09:22.100000,00:09:22.400000,,let's go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,2,1.0,2,00:09:22.400000,00:09:25.300000,,pause filler so this one is two-step,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:09:22.600000,00:11:22.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:09:25.300000,00:09:27,,it's pretty simple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:09:31.400000,00:09:41.100000,so it would be two times eighteen,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:09:41.900000,00:09:42.100000,,no,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:09:42.100000,00:09:48.300000,,so what you do is you add eighteen to both sides to get rid of it first,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,6,00:09:49.100000,00:09:58.100000,,so you have seventy on this side and negative two thirds y,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,6,00:09:58.100000,00:10:01.500000,,and then you just do the same thing except this part is negative,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,6,00:10:05,00:10:21.700000,this would be one forty negative one forty,,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:10:23.100000,00:10:24,,pause filler yes wait no,,,,,,,CF,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:10:24.300000,00:10:25.800000,it's positive,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:10:26.600000,00:10:29.200000,,oh two ten,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:10:29.200000,00:10:29.400000,so (inaudible),,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:10:29.400000,00:10:39.800000,,no no no because you do pause filler because when you divide this you have to multiply it by the reciprocal or three over two,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:10:40.100000,00:10:42.600000,,so it's seventy times three divided by two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,4,00:10:44.300000,00:10:46.900000,,so that's two hundred ten divided by two,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:10:48.100000,00:10:53.300000,twenty-two,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:10:54.700000,00:11:07.100000,,so you got in the end one hundred five,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,3,0.0,2,00:11:07.400000,00:11:18.600000,,yeah times don't mind what's right there but okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,3,00:11:22.500000,00:13:11.200000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:11:22.600000,00:11:23.200000,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:11:23.200000,00:11:23.600000,thirteen oh,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:11:23.600000,00:11:28.400000,so do we still add thirteen to both sides,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:11:28.400000,00:11:28.500000,,no,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,4,00:11:28.500000,00:11:35.400000,,since this is positive you subtract thirteen to both sides,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:11:38.300000,00:12:04,,because you want to get rid of this,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:12:04.800000,00:12:08.400000,,it's thirty-one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:12:09.200000,00:12:09.800000,is it,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:12:10.500000,00:12:10.700000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:12:12.300000,00:12:12.600000,oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:12:17.700000,00:12:19.700000,,okay seven times that equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:12:22.400000,00:12:25.400000,,one half x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:12:25.400000,00:12:41.100000,,and then this is as simple as just x equals two one times thirty-one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:12:41.200000,00:12:45,,so what does x equal,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,2,00:12:45.400000,00:12:46.500000,x equal,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,3,00:12:50,00:12:52.800000,okay x equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,3,00:12:52.800000,00:12:53.900000,pause filler is that multiply,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,3,00:12:54.400000,00:12:55.400000,,yeah it's multiply sorry,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,3,00:13:01.500000,00:13:02.500000,sixty-two,,,,,CA,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,3,00:13:02.600000,00:13:02.900000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,3,00:13:04.200000,00:13:07,x equals,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,3,00:13:10.100000,00:13:11.100000,,awesome,,,,,,,CF,,,,UL,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,4,1.0,3,00:13:11.100000,00:13:16.700000,they just like to come before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:13:11.300000,00:15:29.100000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:13:16.700000,00:13:20.700000,,yeah and that's basically the same idea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:13:22.300000,00:13:25.900000,,since this is negative you are adding this time,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:13:28.800000,00:13:53,pause filler six time thirty-one,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:13:54.600000,00:13:54.800000,wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:13:55.800000,00:13:57.100000,forty-seven,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:13:57.200000,00:14:02.500000,,yeah and this one kind of sucks because you have to multiply that by,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:04,00:14:04.800000,nineteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:04.800000,00:14:07.700000,so this is nineteen over six,,,,,CA,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:07.800000,00:14:08.700000,,what,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:09.100000,00:14:11.800000,is it nineteen over six,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:14:12,00:14:17.700000,,no because when you're adding it this is not affected by that,,,,,ER,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:14:18.400000,00:14:26.500000,,so when you add sixteen here it only affects that,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:14:26.900000,00:14:29,,so it only just gets rid of that,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:14:29,00:14:35.900000,,so you have forty-seven equals three six time x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:14:38.600000,00:14:42.800000,so forty-six times three over forty-seven times three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,4,00:14:43.700000,00:14:50.100000,,it's forty-seven times six because you're dividing by three,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:14:51,00:14:58.300000,,six plus means you're multiplying by six thirds,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:15:06.800000,00:15:14,yeah and then that is all over three,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:15:14.900000,00:15:15.900000,six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:15:16.100000,00:15:16.300000,,three,,,,,,,IF,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,2,00:15:16.300000,00:15:20.800000,,because you have times yeah,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,5,1.0,3,00:15:22.700000,00:15:25.500000,,and that should go in equally yeah,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,2,00:15:29.800000,00:17:42.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:15:29.900000,00:15:36.400000,that's the (inaudible) one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:15:36.900000,00:15:43.800000,,yeah this one shouldn't be too hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:15:44.300000,00:15:44.800000,,let's see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:15:45.100000,00:15:47.900000,,pause filler since this is positive we're going to subtract that,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:15:48.300000,00:15:51.400000,,and we're going to get a negative answer because that's negative,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:15:53.200000,00:15:55.800000,,so you want to do this part,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:15:55.800000,00:15:58,ninety-seven minus eighteen,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:15:58.800000,00:15:59.500000,,minus forty-eight,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:15:59.500000,00:16:01.800000,oh it's minus forty-eight,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:16:01.800000,00:16:02.100000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,5,00:16:04.600000,00:16:24.800000,so forty-five oh,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,5,00:16:24.800000,00:16:34.700000,,what okay okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:16:36.700000,00:16:52.300000,you know it would be forty-nine because it's forty-nine time twelve,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:16:52.300000,00:16:56.400000,,so it would be forty-nine times five over twelve,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:16:57,00:16:57.800000,,and it's negative,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:16:57.800000,00:17:11.900000,,so forty-nine times five over twelve equals y,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,3,00:17:13.200000,00:17:18.600000,,and then you're just going to this is here,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,2,00:17:18.700000,00:17:22.400000,this is forty-five,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,2,00:17:22.400000,00:17:27.900000,,over so it's two forty-five all over twelve,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,2,00:17:27.900000,00:17:29,,that doesn't go any equally,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,2,00:17:29,00:17:30.600000,,so that's just there,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,2,00:17:32.500000,00:17:37.600000,,yeah that's the answer to that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,2,00:17:38.100000,00:17:39.500000,do we stop answering,,,,,OSQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,6,0.0,2,00:17:39.500000,00:17:41.200000,,pause filler I think if we do it will tell us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:17:43,00:20:07.700000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:17:43.100000,00:17:46.200000,,I don't like this one okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:17:46.800000,00:17:55.200000,,so I'm going to rewrite this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:17:55.200000,00:17:56.900000,,you have negative six,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:17:57.100000,00:17:59.900000,,just make eleven make a little more sense,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:18:00.700000,00:18:14.700000,,minus sixty-one equals twenty-five plus seven over seven y because seven over seven equals one,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:18:14.800000,00:18:19.700000,,so that makes it easier to do stuff between these two,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:18:28.200000,00:18:30.800000,this is thirty-six,,,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:18:31.800000,00:18:39.500000,,yeah okay so what you want to do is you want to get the twenty-five over here,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:18:41.400000,00:18:45.200000,,and this over here,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,5,00:18:47.700000,00:18:49.400000,,for either way but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:18:53.100000,00:18:59.700000,,so how you would so that is subtract twenty-five from both sides,,,RS,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:18:59.700000,00:19:08,,you have negative six seven y minus,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,4,00:19:08.300000,00:19:16.200000,,what's that eighty-six equals y,,,OSQ,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:19:17.300000,00:19:25.300000,,and then you can add six sevenths y to both sides,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:19:26.500000,00:19:31.300000,,and so you have negative eighty-six equals,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:19:32.100000,00:19:37.100000,,and since this is seven over seven you get,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:19:39.200000,00:19:46.500000,,pause filler thirteen over seven y because that's just adding the six and the seven,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:19:46.500000,00:19:47.900000,,and you keep the seven on the bottom,,,,,ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:19:49,00:19:51.600000,,and then you do the same thing we've been doing with all of them,,,,,EX,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:19:51.600000,00:19:55.400000,,you just multiply negative eighty-six by seven divided by thirteen,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:19:59.700000,00:20:01.100000,divided by thirteen,,,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:20:01.300000,00:20:01.500000,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:20:04.200000,00:20:05.700000,it's six,,,,,,,,,A,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:20:06.800000,00:20:07.200000,,awesome,,,,,,,CF,,,,UL,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,7,0.0,2,00:20:18.600000,00:20:19.100000,,oh there we go okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:20:22.700000,00:25:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:20:22.900000,00:20:25,,okay this is yeah okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:20:26,00:20:28.700000,,so let's see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:20:32.700000,00:20:36,,so this is eleven over one,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,8,0.0,2,00:20:36.400000,00:21:02.400000,,just to make that that's also thirty-three over three if you want to have it for this three over here,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ

8,2,T1 ,8,0.0,2,00:24:13.400000,00:24:14,that's the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:14.800000,00:24:27.800000,,and also you have negative one hundred equals forty-three over three x,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:29.900000,00:24:40.600000,,and then you multiply it at this I mean you divide this by forty-three over three,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2,T1 ,8,0.0,3,00:24:40.600000,00:24:43.400000,,and you have negative one hundred,,,,,,,SP,,,,,,,,,,,

9,1,T1 ,12,1.0,2,00:27:08,00:27:12.700000,pause filler I mean we should match eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T1 ,12,1.0,2,00:27:16.100000,00:27:22,so then if we would minus eight what would come out as a regular solution,,AH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ

9,1,T2 ,7,0.0,5,00:46:33.200000,00:46:35.700000,,okay pause filler one is seven equals sixty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:46:35.700000,00:46:40.800000,,okay so then we subtract sixty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:46:40.800000,00:46:45.200000,,subtract sixty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,7,0.0,4,00:46:45.300000,00:46:53.200000,,one o seven minus sixty-five is two something forty-two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:47:32,00:47:36.600000,,four equals negative forty-one minus nine k okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:47:37.300000,00:47:42.800000,,so then we add forty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:47:42.800000,00:47:45.100000,,add forty-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:47:47.300000,00:47:50.800000,,so thirty-four plus forty-one equals seven,,,RS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:47:50.800000,00:47:52.300000,seventy-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:47:52.300000,00:48:02.600000,,seventy-five okay so seventy-five equals negative nine negative nine k k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:02.600000,00:48:08.800000,,so then you divide it by nine divide it by nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:08.800000,00:48:15.200000,but I can't go to seventy-five,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:15.200000,00:48:16.500000,and it doesn't move,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:16.500000,00:48:19.500000,,okay pause filler so nine goes into seventy-two right,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:18,00:48:19.500000,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:19.500000,00:48:26.200000,,so are you going to say it's like eight point something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:20,00:48:23.300000,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:27.400000,00:48:29.200000,,eight point whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:30.300000,00:48:36.200000,,okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:40.600000,00:48:40.900000,oh no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:41,00:48:45.300000,,number x equals number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:45.300000,00:48:50.100000,,and equals number so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:50.100000,00:48:50.200000,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,8,0.0,4,00:48:50.300000,00:48:52.400000,,oh add p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,4,00:48:52.500000,00:48:52.800000,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,4,00:48:53.100000,00:48:55.200000,,so add p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,4,00:48:57.200000,00:48:58.200000,,add p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:48:59.800000,00:49:08.100000,,so then it would be negative fifty-two equals nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:08.100000,00:49:15,,and it would be nine p minus sixteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:17.500000,00:49:27.100000,,okay so then we do plus okay plus sixteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:27.200000,00:49:29.500000,,plus sixteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:29.800000,00:49:32.900000,,and then six seven eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:32.900000,00:49:33.600000,,so sixty-eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:33.600000,00:49:38.300000,,pause filler oh wait it's negative pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:38.700000,00:49:40.700000,,is that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:42,00:49:45.500000,eight equals nine p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:45.500000,00:49:46.800000,,wait if it's negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:46.800000,00:49:48.100000,,and we added sixteen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:48.200000,00:49:52.300000,,I think we like forty something forty-eight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:52.300000,00:49:52.800000,,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:54.900000,00:49:58.400000,,so I think because we added a number to a negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDS,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,3,00:49:59.200000,00:50:04.500000,,it would be thirty-nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IDQ,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,5,00:50:06.800000,00:50:07.700000,,twenty-eight okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,5,00:50:07.700000,00:50:18.300000,,forty-eight equals nine p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,5,00:50:18.300000,00:50:19.600000,,then nine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,5,00:50:20.300000,00:50:23.500000,,does nine go into forty-eight thirty-four no,,,CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,9,0.0,5,00:50:29.600000,00:50:31.200000,it's a decimal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9,1,T2 ,11,1.0,6,00:55:20.100000,00:55:20.900000,,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,11,1.0,6,00:55:20.900000,00:55:24,ten ten equals y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,11,1.0,6,00:55:24,00:55:31.800000,,okay so divide it by two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,11,1.0,6,00:55:31.800000,00:55:33.400000,,divide it by two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,1,T2 ,11,1.0,6,00:55:33.400000,00:55:36.300000,,and then y equals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
