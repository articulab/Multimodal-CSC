25,5,1,00:02:11.803,00:02:18.957,00:00:07.154,she said she's going to like set up the servers and stuff so that she can pause filler make sure everything is working properly,
26,5,1,00:02:19.575,00:02:23.367,00:00:03.792,and she  took the stylus for the writing thing,
27,5,1,00:02:24.335,00:02:25.200,00:00:00.865,,oh yeah same here
28,5,1,00:02:26.411,00:02:28.420,00:00:02.009,I guess they don't want us to mess around,
29,5,1,00:02:29.752,00:02:30.091,00:00:00.339,,yeah
30,5,1,00:02:36.650,00:02:42.900,00:00:06.250,so well so did your mom like asked you to do this or,
31,5,1,00:02:45.360,00:02:50.680,00:00:05.320,, I was in desperate need of the money so yeah
32,5,1,00:02:50.994,00:02:53.658,00:00:02.664,my mom just found this on like the Highland Park list,
33,5,1,00:02:53.658,00:02:55.464,00:00:01.806,and she's like all right Jordan you have to go,
34,5,1,00:02:55.534,00:03:00.472,00:00:04.938,and then yeah so and I was like oh I'm getting paid for it,
35,5,1,00:03:00.632,00:03:01.201,00:00:00.569,awesome,
36,5,1,00:03:01.779,00:03:06.499,00:00:04.720,,yeah it's like if reward is involved I will do it
37,5,1,00:03:08.305,00:03:12.605,00:00:04.300,and I heard we get like an extra ten dollars if we finish it or something,
38,5,1,00:03:12.675,00:03:14.830,00:00:02.155,,oh yeah something like that
39,5,1,00:03:15.119,00:03:21.325,00:00:06.206,yeah so if we get this all done imagine twenty-five dollars,
40,5,1,00:03:22.103,00:03:25.895,00:00:03.792,,well all the money I earn I'm in debt to my parents
41,5,1,00:03:26.393,00:03:27.940,00:00:01.547,you're in debt to your parents,
42,5,1,00:03:27.990,00:03:28.469,00:00:00.479,,yeah
43,5,1,00:03:29.750,00:03:32.001,00:00:02.251,well that must be pretty hard then,
44,5,1,00:03:32.370,00:03:36.191,00:00:03.821,,yeah good thing is only like thirty something dollars so
45,5,1,00:03:36.391,00:03:36.780,00:00:00.389,oh,
46,5,1,00:03:37.478,00:03:40.461,00:00:02.983,,and I'll still have some money in the future I guess
47,5,1,00:03:41.739,00:03:45.480,00:00:03.741,yeah so are you good at math or,
48,5,1,00:03:46.278,00:03:48.653,00:00:02.375,,pause filler I'm okay
49,5,1,00:03:48.653,00:03:51.955,00:00:03.302,,surprisingly I have a b in the class which I did not think I have
50,5,1,00:03:53.741,00:03:57.882,00:00:04.141,oh well math is like my worst subject,
51,5,1,00:03:58.421,00:04:01.903,00:00:03.482,but I mean I understand like this stuff,
52,5,1,00:04:01.903,00:04:08.697,00:00:06.794,it's just that some of the algebra I'm getting into is just like pretty difficult for me you know,
53,5,1,00:04:08.767,00:04:15.362,00:00:06.595,,yeah they're like there's a point where it's not easy to make the transition to go to new math
54,5,1,00:04:16.140,00:04:21.398,00:00:05.258,,so you don't really have the best stuff to position on with
55,5,1,00:04:21.957,00:04:23.793,00:00:01.836,yeah I see what you're saying,
56,5,1,00:04:25.190,00:04:30.777,00:00:05.587,,so that I wish there was a better way you could do it like making the transitions
57,5,1,00:04:31.745,00:04:42.000,00:00:10.255,yeah it's like you know just like like one minute it's like the easiest thing ever like those graphs and then like pause filler,
58,5,1,00:04:43.468,00:04:45.943,00:00:02.475,,just like small multiplication division stuff
59,5,1,00:04:45.993,00:04:48.178,00:00:02.185,yeah and then all the sudden it's like pause filler,
60,5,1,00:04:48.477,00:04:49.175,00:00:00.698,,letters
61,5,1,00:04:49.295,00:04:51.720,00:00:02.425,letters variables you know,
62,5,1,00:04:52.538,00:04:53.007,00:00:00.469,,yeah
63,5,1,00:04:53.327,00:04:55.820,00:00:02.493,,and I don't really understand most of it
64,5,1,00:04:56.120,00:05:00.001,00:00:03.881,I mean I understand this stuff which is on my paper right now,
65,5,1,00:05:00.180,00:05:01.727,00:00:01.547,I mean I get that,
66,5,1,00:05:01.787,00:05:12.422,00:00:10.635,but oh like there's just like this weird transition in like the middle of algebra like from algebra half to algebra one,
67,5,1,00:05:13.360,00:05:15.555,00:00:02.195,that is just ridiculous,
68,5,1,00:05:16.344,00:05:16.673,00:00:00.329,,yeah
69,5,1,00:05:18.429,00:05:22.968,00:00:04.539,and you know sometimes it's really stressful for me you know,
70,5,1,00:05:23.417,00:05:28.765,00:00:05.348,,uh-huh like oh I don't like math
71,5,1,00:05:29.200,00:05:30.252,00:00:01.052,I don't like math,
72,5,1,00:05:30.372,00:05:30.581,00:00:00.209,,yeah
73,5,1,00:05:30.581,00:05:34.343,00:00:03.762,I mean the only kid who likes math in my class,
74,5,1,00:05:34.343,00:05:35.370,00:00:01.027,his name is Jacob,
75,5,1,00:05:36.308,00:05:39.990,00:00:03.682,and he basically obsesses almost over every subject,
76,5,1,00:05:39.990,00:05:42.573,00:00:02.583,so I just couldn't talk about him,
77,5,1,00:05:44.968,00:05:44.998,00:00:00.030,,oh
78,5,1,00:05:45.078,00:05:49.428,00:00:04.350,it's like oh the most important thing is learning math and Latin,
79,5,1,00:05:49.428,00:05:53.938,00:00:04.510,and I was like what kind of person would want to talk in Latin about math,
80,5,1,00:05:54.507,00:06:02.269,00:00:07.762,,yeah we have like one kid I know she has I think like a ninety-eight in every class
81,5,1,00:06:02.449,00:06:03.636,00:00:01.187,ninety-eight,
82,5,1,00:06:04.025,00:06:04.344,00:00:00.319,,yeah
83,5,1,00:06:05.290,00:06:05.901,00:00:00.611,Jesus,
84,5,1,00:06:06.080,00:06:07.517,00:00:01.437,,I was going to her house
85,5,1,00:06:07.517,00:06:08.475,00:00:00.958,,and I saw her computer
86,5,1,00:06:08.475,00:06:10.211,00:00:01.736,,and all of her grades were ninety-eights
87,5,1,00:06:12.646,00:06:14.711,00:00:02.065,,she's insane in everything
88,5,1,00:06:15.010,00:06:16.168,00:00:01.158,,I don't know how she does it
89,5,1,00:06:16.726,00:06:19.710,00:00:02.984,I don't know how anyone does it to be perfectly honest,
90,5,1,00:06:19.979,00:06:23.162,00:00:03.183,,yeah so now everyone just idols her
91,5,1,00:06:28.051,00:06:28.080,00:00:00.029,,oh
92,5,1,00:06:28.080,00:06:30.665,00:00:02.585,so what's your stance in your class,
93,5,1,00:06:30.665,00:06:32.381,00:00:01.716,are you like pretty cool or,
94,5,1,00:06:32.969,00:06:34.596,00:00:01.627,,pause filler I was
95,5,1,00:06:35.224,00:06:39.884,00:00:04.660,,and then somebody found out I like watching Japanese shows
96,5,1,00:06:39.884,00:06:42.727,00:00:02.843,,and now barely anybody talks to me
97,5,1,00:06:43.845,00:06:48.965,00:00:05.120,,I don't understand why it's a big deal (laughter)
98,5,1,00:06:48.965,00:06:55.186,00:00:06.221,,(laughter)
99,5,1,00:06:58.150,00:06:59.200,00:00:01.050,I'm sorry,
100,5,1,00:07:00.417,00:07:07.000,00:00:06.583,pause filler I have a cousin I guess who's sort of like you,
101,5,1,00:07:10.694,00:07:14.631,00:00:03.937,pause filler except he watches My Little Pony,
102,5,1,00:07:15.600,00:07:16.000,00:00:00.400,,oh
103,5,1,00:07:15.674,00:07:18.000,00:00:02.326,do you know what those people are,
104,5,1,00:07:17.957,00:07:18.386,00:00:00.429,,yeah
105,5,1,00:07:18.386,00:07:22.267,00:00:03.881,he's like seventeen,
106,5,1,00:07:22.407,00:07:23.135,00:00:00.728,,seventeen
107,5,1,00:07:23.135,00:07:23.814,00:00:00.679,yeah,
108,5,1,00:07:23.844,00:07:26.917,00:00:03.073,,okay (inaudible) seems like thirteen or fourteen
109,5,1,00:07:26.917,00:07:30.359,00:00:03.442,,and we understand just for like popularity wise you have like a joke
110,5,1,00:07:31.337,00:07:37.882,00:00:06.545,,but it depends on really what you see in childhood to really watch the show
111,5,1,00:07:38.441,00:07:46.383,00:00:07.942,oh yeah I mean I was like he's like whatever he has in his computer out or his Xbox out,
112,5,1,00:07:46.383,00:07:51.870,00:00:05.487,and he has like a profile picture of like I don't know one of the weird things I,
113,5,1,00:08:24.400,00:08:25.250,00:00:00.850,all right,
114,5,1,00:08:52.308,00:08:53.201,00:00:00.893,all right roger that,
115,5,1,00:08:54.626,00:08:56.150,00:00:01.524,,all right
116,5,1,00:08:58.596,00:09:05.751,00:00:07.155,all right so pause filler ding it,
117,5,1,00:09:06.071,00:09:14.796,00:00:08.725,all right so basically pause filler all right so pause filler you see this problem here,
118,5,1,00:09:15.141,00:09:15.370,00:00:00.229,,yeah
119,5,1,00:09:16.300,00:09:19.012,00:00:02.712,all right I'm writing good so,
120,5,1,00:09:22.000,00:09:23.133,00:00:01.133,all right so basically,
121,5,1,00:09:26.355,00:09:28.660,00:00:02.305,pause filler do you see the variable here,
122,5,1,00:09:29.368,00:09:29.538,00:00:00.170,,yeah
123,5,1,00:09:29.578,00:09:30.666,00:00:01.088,okay why is my thing blue,
124,5,1,00:09:32.561,00:09:33.539,00:00:00.978,,was this supposed to be green
125,5,1,00:09:34.277,00:09:34.746,00:00:00.469,yeah,
126,5,1,00:09:36.300,00:09:38.328,00:00:02.028,all right so see the variable over here,
127,5,1,00:09:38.787,00:09:38.987,00:00:00.200,,yeah
128,5,1,00:09:38.987,00:09:43.506,00:00:04.519,basically what you have to do is that you have to get the variable by itself,
129,5,1,00:09:44.883,00:09:52.446,00:00:07.563,and pause filler the way you do that is by pause filler adding on both sides,
130,5,1,00:09:53.424,00:10:00.448,00:00:07.024,and it's sort of weird I know because math all right so,
131,5,1,00:10:00.448,00:10:14.855,00:00:14.407,pause filler what you do is that if you have a subtraction space there if you have sign that's subtracted pause filler what you do is that you write below it add that number,
132,5,1,00:10:15.344,00:10:15.813,00:00:00.469,you see,
133,5,1,00:10:18.118,00:10:18.317,00:00:00.199,,yeah
134,5,1,00:10:18.317,00:10:20.901,00:00:02.584,so and then you'd add it to that side,
135,5,1,00:10:20.901,00:10:24.214,00:00:03.313,so you'd write plus number on the thirteen you,
136,5,1,00:10:24.852,00:10:25.591,00:00:00.739,see what I'm saying,
137,5,1,00:10:25.100,00:10:26.329,00:00:01.229,,yeah
138,5,1,00:10:26.578,00:10:27.407,00:00:00.829,so try it out,
139,5,1,00:10:27.806,00:10:29.991,00:00:02.185,,so let's take a walk
140,5,1,00:10:31.956,00:10:33.942,00:00:01.986,,so here you'd be adding okay
141,5,1,00:10:35.378,00:10:35.588,00:00:00.210,,wow
142,5,1,00:10:35.588,00:10:36.217,00:00:00.629,,this is weird
143,5,1,00:10:37.953,00:10:43.909,00:00:05.956,oh it's all right yeah (laughter),
144,5,1,00:10:43.909,00:10:44.258,00:00:00.349,,wow
145,5,1,00:10:45.795,00:10:49.616,00:00:03.821,oh no no no you don't add the x,
146,5,1,00:10:49.756,00:10:51.592,00:00:01.836,you add the six,
147,5,1,00:10:51.592,00:10:52.929,00:00:01.337,,oh that's right
148,5,1,00:10:52.929,00:10:53.697,00:00:00.768,,I can do that okay
149,5,1,00:10:54.096,00:10:57.468,00:00:03.372,,let's see I can undo this
150,5,1,00:10:59.000,00:11:01.210,00:00:02.210,like have you ever used one of these things before,
151,5,1,00:11:01.589,00:11:01.998,00:00:00.409,,no
152,5,1,00:11:02.666,00:11:06.308,00:00:03.642,oh man it works like a charm if you're trying to like draw on stuff,
153,5,1,00:11:06.548,00:11:08.593,00:00:02.045,but I have like a surface,
154,5,1,00:11:08.793,00:11:12.215,00:00:03.422,so basically what I do is that I get a Bluetooth mouse,
155,5,1,00:11:12.614,00:11:16.545,00:00:03.931,and I use that to draw most of the time,
156,5,1,00:11:16.545,00:11:18.301,00:00:01.756,but pause filler anyways let's just get back on topic,
157,5,1,00:11:18.570,00:11:21.573,00:00:03.003,so what you do is that you would add the number not the variable,
158,5,1,00:11:21.653,00:11:23.798,00:00:02.145,you want to get the variable by itself,
159,5,1,00:11:24.138,00:11:24.497,00:00:00.359,,uh-huh
160,5,1,00:11:24.986,00:11:25.295,00:00:00.309,yeah,
161,5,1,00:11:25.405,00:11:28.627,00:00:03.222,,so then here would be the plus six
162,5,1,00:11:28.887,00:11:32.189,00:00:03.302,,and yeah I'll also add six
163,5,1,00:11:32.908,00:11:33.377,00:00:00.469,pause filler yes,
164,5,1,00:11:33.377,00:11:33.766,00:00:00.389,correct,
165,5,1,00:11:34.175,00:11:37.268,00:00:03.093,,okay so
166,5,1,00:11:38.655,00:11:45.080,00:00:06.425,pause filler basically pause filler just scratch out the six sort of like pause filler sort of like this,
167,5,1,00:11:47.954,00:11:49.221,00:00:01.267,,I see there we go
168,5,1,00:11:51.974,00:11:55.037,00:00:03.063,so just pretend that six doesn't exist anymore,
169,5,1,00:11:56.015,00:11:56.334,00:00:00.319,,right
170,5,1,00:11:56.903,00:11:59.866,00:00:02.963,oh and I'll rewrite that because I accidentally did it,
171,5,1,00:12:01.600,00:12:02.680,00:00:01.080,I was trying to,
172,5,1,00:12:05.284,00:12:06.731,00:00:01.447,oh whoops crap,
173,5,1,00:12:13.800,00:12:14.300,00:00:00.500,all right,
174,5,1,00:12:17.100,00:12:18.654,00:00:01.554,are you still scratching up the six now,
175,5,1,00:12:19.700,00:12:25.578,00:00:05.878,all you have to do is put a cross between the negative six and the plus six,
176,5,1,00:12:26.127,00:12:29.768,00:00:03.641,but you keep the six on the thirteen side as it is,
177,5,1,00:12:30.227,00:12:33.759,00:00:03.532,,right wait okay it asked me a question
178,5,1,00:12:33.759,00:12:34.787,00:00:01.028,,so I don't know why I did that
179,5,1,00:12:36.134,00:12:38.289,00:00:02.155,it went full screen on my Skype for a second,
180,5,1,00:12:39.197,00:12:40.145,00:00:00.948,,oh okay
181,5,1,00:12:43.038,00:12:47.428,00:00:04.390,okay so you see pause filler all you need to do is just add,
182,5,1,00:12:49.045,00:12:51.310,00:00:02.265,,so then this would be nineteen
183,5,1,00:12:51.310,00:12:51.509,00:00:00.199,,great
184,5,1,00:12:51.509,00:12:51.838,00:00:00.329,yeah,
185,5,1,00:12:52.696,00:12:55.000,00:00:02.304,,we'll put a nine there and separate that
186,5,1,00:12:58.319,00:12:59.405,00:00:01.086,,looks pretty decent
187,5,1,00:12:59.999,00:13:03.911,00:00:03.912,and then you'd write x sequels because that's the only thing left,
188,5,1,00:13:04.579,00:13:09.648,00:00:05.069,,oh yeah so then okay yeah that's starting to make sense
189,5,1,00:13:09.927,00:13:11.853,00:00:01.926,yeah so now you're done,
190,5,1,00:13:12.501,00:13:12.920,00:00:00.419,,sweet
191,5,1,00:13:14.906,00:13:17.280,00:00:02.374,,so we go to the next problem right
192,5,1,00:13:17.630,00:13:21.790,00:00:04.160,yeah all right so that would be oh my gosh twenty-three,
193,5,1,00:13:21.920,00:13:24.913,00:00:02.993,all right this is going to be the end of me,
194,5,1,00:13:24.913,00:13:34.162,00:00:09.249,so all right so usually get a basic of this one right because all you have to do is just add again,
195,5,1,00:13:34.162,00:13:35.788,00:00:01.626,you just add to both sides,
196,5,1,00:13:35.898,00:13:40.168,00:00:04.270,so it's basically just do it again I guess it's a,
197,5,1,00:13:40.418,00:13:44.129,00:00:03.711,,it's good practice to fully understand it
198,5,1,00:13:44.379,00:13:49.827,00:00:05.448,yeah and the only difference here is that it's flipped,
199,5,1,00:13:49.827,00:13:51.203,00:00:01.376,and that it has a p,
200,5,1,00:13:51.602,00:13:55.643,00:00:04.041,I don't know how that's supposed to confuse us in anyway whatsoever but (laughter),
201,5,1,00:13:57.550,00:14:01.660,00:00:04.110,,so I was going to cross that out because it's not really going to do much
202,5,1,00:14:01.869,00:14:06.319,00:00:04.450,yeah you could just cross at it first I mean pause filler yeah,
203,5,1,00:14:09.681,00:14:17.800,00:00:08.119,they write really weird on this paper because they have like oh I'm not allowed to showed it but they put like the nine after the p (laughter) like the plus eight after,
204,5,1,00:14:20.754,00:14:23.958,00:00:03.204,like the plus eight after,
205,5,1,00:14:24.448,00:14:25.346,00:00:00.898,I don't know,
206,5,1,00:14:25.795,00:14:27.351,00:00:01.556,,that's strange
207,5,1,00:14:27.471,00:14:28.090,00:00:00.619,I know,
208,5,1,00:14:28.908,00:14:30.853,00:00:01.945,college students you know all right,
209,5,1,00:14:30.853,00:14:31.133,00:00:00.280,,yeah
210,5,1,00:14:31.881,00:14:33.757,00:00:01.876,all right so you got that one,
211,5,1,00:14:33.757,00:14:36.000,00:00:02.243,I'm just going to do that to confirm it,
212,5,1,00:14:37.688,00:14:38.426,00:00:00.738,pause filler next page,
213,5,1,00:14:40.600,00:14:42.098,00:00:01.498,,this is subtraction right
214,5,1,00:14:42.936,00:14:43.505,00:00:00.569,yeah,
215,5,1,00:14:43.694,00:14:53.600,00:00:09.906,all right so basically what you do is that instead of adding like we did before we subtract,
216,5,1,00:14:53.600,00:14:53.961,00:00:00.361,whoo,
217,5,1,00:14:55.100,00:14:55.900,00:00:00.800,,yeah
218,5,1,00:14:56.000,00:14:58.000,00:00:02.000,and then (inaudible) because that's going to that's ,
219,5,1,00:14:59.234,00:15:01.834,00:00:02.600,because that's an that's a,
220,5,1,00:15:07.244,00:15:11.181,00:00:03.937,because that's a addition symbol,
221,5,1,00:15:11.840,00:15:19.163,00:00:07.323,pause filler and basically what you have to do is that you have to do the exact opposite of the symbol that's up there,
222,5,1,00:15:19.253,00:15:19.642,00:00:00.389,you see,
223,5,1,00:15:20.331,00:15:20.900,00:00:00.569,,yup
224,5,1,00:15:21.209,00:15:22.396,00:00:01.187,pause filler so basically,
225,5,1,00:15:25.500,00:15:27.400,00:00:01.900,it's really simple,
226,5,1,00:15:28.300,00:15:31.106,00:00:02.806,and then you just do it the other side I mean,
227,5,1,00:15:31.376,00:15:34.429,00:00:03.053,and they also made it okay this time,
228,5,1,00:15:34.429,00:15:37.053,00:00:02.624,so that's the part that confused me the most,
229,5,1,00:15:37.222,00:15:37.651,00:00:00.429,,yeah
230,5,1,00:15:37.841,00:15:38.290,00:00:00.449,yeah,
231,5,1,00:15:38.450,00:15:42.750,00:00:04.300,,so this is basically just six equals k
232,5,1,00:15:44.550,00:15:45.500,00:00:00.950,,right
233,5,1,00:15:48.257,00:15:48.587,00:00:00.330,pause filler yeah,
234,5,1,00:15:49.275,00:15:53.655,00:00:04.380,we don't even need to do that much work for that one because that's like simple simple math,
235,5,1,00:15:54.000,00:15:55.551,00:00:01.551,all right good job,
236,5,1,00:15:56.199,00:15:57.000,00:00:00.801,,thanks
237,5,1,00:15:58.364,00:16:00.609,00:00:02.245,all right next problem,
238,5,1,00:16:00.939,00:16:01.527,00:00:00.588,oh whoops,
239,5,1,00:16:01.707,00:16:02.764,00:00:01.057,I don't want to double-click,
240,5,1,00:16:02.764,00:16:04.550,00:00:01.786,thank you p keyboard,
241,5,1,00:16:07.000,00:16:12.482,00:00:05.482,all right this one is easier than it looks,
242,5,1,00:16:13.460,00:16:16.543,00:00:03.083,all you have to do is divide,
243,5,1,00:16:17.381,00:16:18.040,00:00:00.659,and then you're done,
244,5,1,00:16:19.500,00:16:21.000,00:00:01.500,,I think I got it already
245,5,1,00:16:22.500,00:16:23.400,00:00:00.900,you did,
246,5,1,00:16:23.308,00:16:24.914,00:00:01.606,,yeah I saw it
247,5,1,00:16:24.914,00:16:25.952,00:00:01.038,,and then it came to me
248,5,1,00:16:26.391,00:16:29.000,00:00:02.609,,but I think I'll do the math just in case okay
249,5,1,00:16:30.384,00:16:31.044,00:00:00.660,,okay
250,5,1,00:16:31.130,00:16:36.987,00:00:05.857,yeah because they want you to do the math and stuff like that because they have like cameras all around us and stuff,
251,5,1,00:16:37.964,00:16:40.100,00:00:02.136,,yeah I don't like camearas
252,5,1,00:16:39.800,00:16:41.200,00:00:01.400,I know they're scary (sfx),
253,5,1,00:16:46.000,00:16:48.000,00:00:02.000,,boy that floor looks really weird
254,5,1,00:16:49.500,00:16:52.432,00:00:02.932,looks like that's more like Malaysian symbol or something,
255,5,1,00:16:52.940,00:16:53.290,00:00:00.350,,yeah
256,5,1,00:16:53.838,00:16:58.500,00:00:04.662,,so yeah it is kind of is five
257,5,1,00:16:58.971,00:16:59.600,00:00:00.629,,right
258,5,1,00:16:59.927,00:17:01.195,00:00:01.268,erm five?,
259,5,1,00:17:04.255,00:17:06.500,00:00:02.245,how? explain your answer,
260,5,1,00:17:06.500,00:17:09.612,00:00:03.112,,okay I'll explain it in math
261,5,1,00:17:12.500,00:17:14.800,00:00:02.300,,got five
262,5,1,00:17:16.300,00:17:18.353,00:00:02.053,,it doesn't really look like a five
263,5,1,00:17:18.782,00:17:19.690,00:00:00.908,,so that's twenty
264,5,1,00:17:19.690,00:17:20.957,00:00:01.267,,so we got zero there
265,5,1,00:17:21.356,00:17:21.924,00:00:00.568,,no
266,5,1,00:17:24.010,00:17:25.417,00:00:01.407,,undo that
267,5,1,00:17:25.746,00:17:25.995,00:00:00.249,,no
268,5,1,00:17:25.995,00:17:26.285,00:00:00.290,,why
269,5,1,00:17:26.913,00:17:28.420,00:00:01.507,,I don't want it
270,5,1,00:17:28.420,00:17:29.717,00:00:01.297,,okay there we go
271,5,1,00:17:30.076,00:17:31.712,00:00:01.636,,we put the zero there
272,5,1,00:17:32.061,00:17:35.065,00:00:03.004,,and then five times four is twenty
273,5,1,00:17:35.065,00:17:39.904,00:00:04.839,,so you have an extra two y two twenty
274,5,1,00:17:39.944,00:17:41.001,00:00:01.057,,hey it is right
275,5,1,00:17:42.598,00:17:45.350,00:00:02.752,,I do my math right right
276,5,1,00:17:48.544,00:17:49.500,00:00:00.956,hold on,
277,5,1,00:17:52.176,00:17:52.724,00:00:00.548,pause filler forty-four,
278,5,1,00:17:54.200,00:17:56.286,00:00:02.086,then we go into that,
279,5,1,00:17:58.372,00:17:59.679,00:00:01.307,yeah you're correct,
280,5,1,00:17:59.868,00:18:00.377,00:00:00.509,,sweet
281,5,1,00:18:01.095,00:18:07.052,00:00:05.957,all right so basically what you do is that you'd say x equals five because pause filler the two twenty is gone,
282,5,1,00:18:07.052,00:18:08.359,00:00:01.307,and then the forty-four is gone,
283,5,1,00:18:08.359,00:18:11.093,00:00:02.734,so you just have to leave it at five so,
284,5,1,00:18:14.500,00:18:15.762,00:00:01.262,all right perfect line,
285,5,1,00:18:15.762,00:18:17.498,00:00:01.736,all right page five,
286,5,1,00:18:17.947,00:18:20.890,00:00:02.943,oh I don't want to double-click,
287,5,1,00:18:22.447,00:18:22.876,00:00:00.429,oh my gosh,
288,5,1,00:18:22.876,00:18:24.522,00:00:01.646,now it's showing me Adobe Flash Player,
289,5,1,00:18:25.200,00:18:26.737,00:00:01.537,this isn't an Adobe Flash game,
290,5,1,00:18:26.737,00:18:28.224,00:00:01.487,and I just closed another room,
291,5,1,00:18:28.892,00:18:31.666,00:00:02.774,well I don't think that did anything I hope (laughter),
292,5,1,00:18:31.866,00:18:35.936,00:00:04.070,all right what's this,
293,5,1,00:18:37.373,00:18:42.721,00:00:05.348,all right pause filler if you saw that that's just what I'm clarifying pause filler people CMU so,
294,5,1,00:18:42.721,00:18:50.264,00:00:07.543,,is that are there is that a minus with the thirteen p and forty-one or is that an equal sign
295,5,1,00:18:51.062,00:18:53.676,00:00:02.614,,for some reason I only see one line
296,5,1,00:18:55.252,00:18:57.088,00:00:01.836,oh you just have to click the screen again,
297,5,1,00:18:57.807,00:18:58.136,00:00:00.329,,oh
298,5,1,00:18:59.602,00:19:02.376,00:00:02.774,oh you see it now,
299,5,1,00:19:03.494,00:19:05.070,00:00:01.576,,yeah I faintly see it
300,5,1,00:19:05.070,00:19:07.195,00:00:02.125,,so I got that in mind now
301,5,1,00:19:07.195,00:19:13.251,00:00:06.056,pause filler it's minus nine plus thirteen p equals forty-one,
302,5,1,00:19:15.107,00:19:15.596,00:00:00.489,,yeah
303,5,1,00:19:16.734,00:19:19.338,00:00:02.604,,let's see how we would oh wait so we would
304,5,1,00:19:21.672,00:19:24.935,00:00:03.263,,add nine to the negative nine and forty-one
305,5,1,00:19:26.641,00:19:28.716,00:00:02.075,we'd add nine to forty-one,
306,5,1,00:19:28.716,00:19:31.799,00:00:03.083,we wouldn't do anything with subtraction,
307,5,1,00:19:33.376,00:19:35.800,00:00:02.424,,right so plus 
308,5,1,00:19:35.800,00:19:41.096,00:00:05.296,because we're just doing the opposite on the other side,
309,5,1,00:19:41.427,00:19:42.246,00:00:00.819,we're not really,
310,5,1,00:19:43.473,00:19:49.858,00:00:06.385,,oh yeah so the negative nine really doesn't have any value to us as of right now
311,5,1,00:19:49.858,00:19:52.871,00:00:03.013,yeah and all you have to do is do it on the other side too,
312,5,1,00:19:52.871,00:19:57.082,00:00:04.211,and then just cross it out because it says they said we have to like show our work,
313,5,1,00:19:57.082,00:19:58.798,00:00:01.716,and that's why we typically do it,
314,5,1,00:20:00.245,00:20:02.968,00:00:02.723,,yeah so only teachers could explain it this simply
315,5,1,00:20:04.800,00:20:07.398,00:00:02.598,hearing it from a kid is like ten times better,
316,5,1,00:20:07.927,00:20:09.045,00:00:01.118,,yeah why
317,5,1,00:20:09.045,00:20:10.851,00:00:01.806,,I can't draw on this
318,5,1,00:20:11.679,00:20:12.038,00:00:00.359,oh,
319,5,1,00:20:13.495,00:20:16.800,00:00:03.305,,okay let's see
320,5,1,00:20:18.204,00:20:18.932,00:00:00.728,,here we go
321,5,1,00:20:19.232,00:20:21.100,00:00:01.868,whoops,
322,5,1,00:20:21.885,00:20:23.512,00:00:01.627,,yeah I'll draw another one
323,5,1,00:20:23.851,00:20:24.440,00:00:00.589,all right,
324,5,1,00:20:24.539,00:20:25.500,00:00:00.961,,here we go
325,5,1,00:20:24.949,00:20:26.645,00:00:01.696,yeah yeah all right you got fifty,
326,5,1,00:20:27.183,00:20:28.830,00:00:01.647,,fifty and thirteen
327,5,1,00:20:28.830,00:20:31.284,00:00:02.454,and then here comes the trickier part,
328,5,1,00:20:31.484,00:20:39.200,00:00:07.716,you have (laughter) oh you have to divide fifty by thirteen,
329,5,1,00:20:40.400,00:20:42.400,00:00:02.000,,oh you got to be kidding me
330,5,1,00:20:42.010,00:20:44.115,00:00:02.105,which is actually pretty difficult,
331,5,1,00:20:44.305,00:20:46.949,00:00:02.644,,yeah because it doesn't go into any bits
332,5,1,00:20:46.949,00:20:49.134,00:00:02.185,,so you have to figure out what number it is
333,5,1,00:20:50.650,00:20:55.958,00:00:05.308,yeah so just I mean it will take a while because we're riding on this thing,
334,5,1,00:20:55.958,00:20:58.422,00:00:02.464,and you're obviously a newbie to this sport,
335,5,1,00:21:00.678,00:21:02.172,00:00:01.494,so,
336,5,1,00:21:02.900,00:21:05.466,00:00:02.566,might be a bit difficult,
337,5,1,00:21:06.055,00:21:09.028,00:00:02.973,,all right I'm going to wing it here
338,5,1,00:21:09.388,00:21:12.969,00:00:03.581,,and see where thirteen times five gets me
339,5,1,00:21:13.937,00:21:17.539,00:00:03.602,,and then I'll try to see how that goes
340,5,1,00:21:18.048,00:21:19.235,00:00:01.187,thirteen times five,
341,5,1,00:21:19.235,00:21:20.183,00:00:00.948,how does that work,
342,5,1,00:21:20.283,00:21:26.598,00:00:06.315,,pause filler well for me what I would do is that I would you know do the problem
343,5,1,00:21:26.598,00:21:30.829,00:00:04.231,,and if that's not the number I'd to go a little higher then to a little lower which then
344,5,1,00:21:30.829,00:21:31.218,00:00:00.389,oh,
345,5,1,00:21:32.246,00:21:34.730,00:00:02.484,,wow that's not it at all
346,5,1,00:21:35.817,00:21:41.085,00:00:05.268,,pause filler I'm going to try four because four seems to be the magic number today
347,5,1,00:21:43.340,00:21:46.403,00:00:03.063,,all right do me some good
348,5,1,00:21:48.848,00:21:50.484,00:00:01.636,,okay that's not a twelve
349,5,1,00:21:50.484,00:21:51.113,00:00:00.629,,that's not a two
350,5,1,00:21:51.113,00:21:52.869,00:00:01.756,that's a twenty,
351,5,1,00:21:52.869,00:21:54.695,00:00:01.826,that's a z oh,
352,5,1,00:21:55.373,00:21:57.887,00:00:02.514,,it's something
353,5,1,00:21:59.344,00:21:59.933,00:00:00.589,surely,
354,5,1,00:22:00.841,00:22:01.339,00:00:00.498,,so it
355,5,1,00:22:01.759,00:22:02.517,00:00:00.758,,wow
356,5,1,00:22:02.826,00:22:04.412,00:00:01.586,,that's actually really close
357,5,1,00:22:05.739,00:22:08.044,00:00:02.305,,so my guess it would be three because
358,5,1,00:22:09.112,00:22:09.950,00:00:00.838,I don't think it would be three,
359,5,1,00:22:09.950,00:22:15.058,00:00:05.108,it would have to be a decimal number because it's between three and four,
360,5,1,00:22:15.258,00:22:19.129,00:00:03.871,pause filler if you did three and if you did basic math you'd get thirty-nine,
361,5,1,00:22:19.847,00:22:23.000,00:00:03.153,,yeah so we would have so
362,5,1,00:22:23.230,00:22:24.467,00:00:01.237,you just have to divide,
363,5,1,00:22:24.467,00:22:26.602,00:00:02.135,I mean there's really no other way of doing it,
364,5,1,00:22:27.121,00:22:29.515,00:00:02.394,,yeah so we get there
365,5,1,00:22:29.755,00:22:30.982,00:00:01.227,,and it would be
366,5,1,00:22:34.594,00:22:34.913,00:00:00.319,,wow
367,5,1,00:22:34.913,00:22:38.914,00:00:04.001,,this okay so we would get eleven from this right
368,5,1,00:22:39.323,00:22:40.760,00:00:01.437,,if we were to subtract this
369,5,1,00:22:42.366,00:22:44.771,00:00:02.405,,I'm totally stumped
370,5,1,00:22:44.771,00:22:48.053,00:00:03.282,all right so let me tell you what you would do,
371,5,1,00:22:48.502,00:22:51.815,00:00:03.313,so basically what you would do is that you just write thirteen,
372,5,1,00:22:52.583,00:22:53.411,00:00:00.828,and undo that,
373,5,1,00:22:53.690,00:22:55.556,00:00:01.866,and then fifty,
374,5,1,00:22:59.298,00:22:59.787,00:00:00.489,all right,
375,5,1,00:23:00.365,00:23:07.958,00:00:07.593,and then what you do is that you try to find the highest number that's closest to this which is three,
376,5,1,00:23:08.906,00:23:09.255,00:00:00.349,,yeah
377,5,1,00:23:10.891,00:23:11.999,00:00:01.108,and then you do that,
378,5,1,00:23:11.999,00:23:13.256,00:00:01.257,and you get thirty-nine,
379,5,1,00:23:16.090,00:23:17.955,00:00:01.865,and then you'd cross out the five,
380,5,1,00:23:17.955,00:23:19.113,00:00:01.158,and then you get the four,
381,5,1,00:23:19.622,00:23:20.569,00:00:00.947,and then you get that,
382,5,1,00:23:21.118,00:23:23.652,00:00:02.534,and then you get one hundred and ten,
383,5,1,00:23:23.972,00:23:30.726,00:00:06.754,and then what you'd have to do is you'd have to ridiculously try to find what one hundred and ten is,
384,5,1,00:23:31.205,00:23:34.500,00:00:03.295,so pause filler thirteen times,
385,5,1,00:23:38.209,00:23:39.437,00:00:01.228,pause filler let's try eight,
386,5,1,00:23:40.454,00:23:41.651,00:00:01.197,pause filler twenty-four,
387,5,1,00:23:45.593,00:23:46.620,00:00:01.027,pause filler one zero four,
388,5,1,00:23:46.740,00:23:47.538,00:00:00.798,that's correct,
389,5,1,00:23:48.047,00:23:54.000,00:00:05.953,so it would be eight and one zero four ,
390,5,1,00:23:55.428,00:23:56.909,00:00:01.481,six,
391,5,1,00:23:59.531,00:24:00.289,00:00:00.758,sixty,
392,5,1,00:24:01.227,00:24:06.854,00:00:05.627,now if you we're going to get an answer like this it's going to be like infinite all right,
393,5,1,00:24:07.343,00:24:07.602,00:00:00.259,,yeah
394,5,1,00:24:08.600,00:24:11.304,00:00:02.704,what we're going to do is that we're going to get this,
395,5,1,00:24:11.653,00:24:12.701,00:00:01.048,and then we're going to do it,
396,5,1,00:24:12.741,00:24:14.656,00:00:01.915,we're going to get one more decimal number,
397,5,1,00:24:15.085,00:24:20.214,00:00:05.129,and if it's above five we just set it to the number above it,
398,5,1,00:24:20.214,00:24:23.876,00:00:03.662,so pause filler let's say we get seven,
399,5,1,00:24:27.000,00:24:29.203,00:00:02.203,pause filler we get like three point seven eight,
400,5,1,00:24:29.612,00:24:32.426,00:00:02.814,if this number is four we don't have to change it,
401,5,1,00:24:33.095,00:24:38.053,00:00:04.958,,oh yeah because it rounds up or down depending on the number and then the last of it
402,5,1,00:24:38.173,00:24:41.256,00:00:03.083,yeah yeah and so basically this is just going to be a rounding thing,
403,5,1,00:24:44.708,00:24:47.500,00:00:02.792,and yeah so,
404,5,1,00:24:50.445,00:24:51.433,00:00:00.988,thirteen,
405,5,1,00:24:53.458,00:24:55.045,00:00:01.587,,and sixteen
406,5,1,00:24:57.908,00:24:59.056,00:00:01.148,,wouldn't that be four then
407,5,1,00:24:59.425,00:25:00.432,00:00:01.007,it would have,
408,5,1,00:25:02.677,00:25:04.912,00:00:02.235,,yeah because thirteen times four is fifty-two
409,5,1,00:25:06.688,00:25:09.661,00:00:02.973,yeah right you're looking at your previous work,
410,5,1,00:25:09.671,00:25:11.108,00:00:01.437,and I'm not (laughter),
411,5,1,00:25:12.600,00:25:14.032,00:00:01.432,all right and then fifty-two,
412,5,1,00:25:14.032,00:25:15.817,00:00:01.785,oh I'm going off the page ding it,
413,5,1,00:25:16.227,00:25:17.633,00:00:01.406,and then that would be eight,
414,5,1,00:25:19.449,00:25:21.036,00:00:01.587,and then that would be eighty,
415,5,1,00:25:21.036,00:25:25.027,00:00:03.991,so it's obviously a number higher than five you see,
416,5,1,00:25:25.116,00:25:27.880,00:00:02.764,so this would round to,
417,5,1,00:25:28.788,00:25:29.975,00:00:01.187,,three point eight five
418,5,1,00:25:30.414,00:25:31.282,00:00:00.868,yeah correct,
419,5,1,00:25:31.711,00:25:32.330,00:00:00.619,,all right
420,5,1,00:25:34.295,00:25:36.381,00:00:02.086,oh do you know what I just realized,
421,5,1,00:25:36.590,00:25:37.019,00:00:00.429,,what
422,5,1,00:25:38.496,00:25:45.809,00:00:07.313,what we could've done this is going to sound really really bad,
423,5,1,00:25:46.967,00:25:53.073,00:00:06.106,basically what we could've done is that we could've just done this,
424,5,1,00:25:58.800,00:26:01.000,00:00:02.200,and then we could've just stopped,
425,5,1,00:26:06.000,00:26:08.318,00:00:02.318,,(laughter) oh wow
426,5,1,00:26:07.500,00:26:10.194,00:00:02.694,oh we overcomplicated the problem,
427,5,1,00:26:10.443,00:26:11.501,00:00:01.058,,yeah oh my gosh
428,5,1,00:26:12.800,00:26:18.435,00:00:05.635,all right but I think we showed enough work on this page already,
429,5,1,00:26:18.864,00:26:19.303,00:00:00.439,,yeah
430,5,1,00:26:22.037,00:26:26.277,00:00:04.240,so I'm just going to underline both of these just in case,
431,5,1,00:26:27.634,00:26:28.063,00:00:00.429,,yeah
432,5,1,00:26:28.732,00:26:31.625,00:00:02.893,oh I am a great tutor,
433,5,1,00:26:31.625,00:26:33.122,00:00:01.497,all right next page,
434,5,1,00:26:35.100,00:26:37.000,00:00:01.900,all right oh,
435,5,1,00:26:38.400,00:26:41.014,00:00:02.614,,okay I think I got this
436,5,1,00:26:41.014,00:26:41.972,00:00:00.958,,let's see if I can get this
437,5,1,00:26:41.972,00:26:42.441,00:00:00.469,all right,
438,5,1,00:26:46.102,00:26:49.864,00:00:03.762,,wait not it kept cutting out
439,5,1,00:26:49.864,00:26:51.929,00:00:02.065,,I have no idea why the pen cuts out
440,5,1,00:26:52.548,00:26:53.476,00:00:00.928,,come on undo
441,5,1,00:26:53.476,00:26:55.581,00:00:02.105,,I tell you to undo you undo
442,5,1,00:26:58.275,00:26:59.053,00:00:00.778,,here we go
443,5,1,00:26:59.103,00:27:00.160,00:00:01.057,,no I want that there
444,5,1,00:27:00.350,00:27:02.206,00:00:01.856,,there we go okay
445,5,1,00:27:02.206,00:27:03.233,00:00:01.027,,let's try this again
446,5,1,00:27:05.658,00:27:06.276,00:00:00.618,,oh sweet
447,5,1,00:27:07.100,00:27:10.477,00:00:03.377,all right that was okay I mean oh,
448,5,1,00:27:11.684,00:27:14.198,00:00:02.514,,yeah I am so new to this
449,5,1,00:27:15.525,00:27:18.369,00:00:02.844,well it just takes time to get used to I mean,
450,5,1,00:27:18.658,00:27:23.388,00:00:04.730,,yeah well everything in general takes time to get used to
451,5,1,00:27:23.866,00:27:27.299,00:00:03.433,yeah like I've only used this three times but I don't own one,
452,5,1,00:27:27.299,00:27:28.656,00:00:01.357,but I am really good at using it,
453,5,1,00:27:28.656,00:27:32.500,00:00:03.844,like I could just like draw something really good on this I bet,
454,5,1,00:27:36.300,00:27:40.499,00:00:04.199, yes six divided by twenty-four that's four equals x right,
455,5,1,00:27:40.499,00:27:42.933,00:00:02.434,we actually got a simpler answer,
456,5,1,00:27:42.933,00:27:45.128,00:00:02.195,thank you CMU all right,
457,5,1,00:27:46.800,00:27:49.079,00:00:02.279,,I don't understand college technology
458,5,1,00:27:49.079,00:27:55.365,00:00:06.286,(inaudible) pause filler this is like I'm in a game designing studios,
459,5,1,00:27:55.365,00:27:59.332,00:00:03.967,so I guess that's why they use this so,
460,5,1,00:27:59.332,00:28:01.332,00:00:02.000,like concept art,
461,5,1,00:28:02.600,00:28:04.754,00:00:02.154,,I have a room surrounded by glass
462,5,1,00:28:06.360,00:28:07.837,00:00:01.477,that is terrifying,
463,5,1,00:28:07.956,00:28:08.415,00:00:00.459,,yeah
464,5,1,00:28:09.891,00:28:11.806,00:00:01.915,alright so,
465,5,1,00:28:13.100,00:28:15.479,00:00:02.379,this one is a bit easier I guess,
466,5,1,00:28:15.479,00:28:18.422,00:00:02.943,so take note I said I guess,
467,5,1,00:28:18.851,00:28:27.572,00:00:08.721,so pause filler what we're going to do is that this is probably going to be another one of those problems where it's going to be like ridiculously like pause filler,
468,5,1,00:28:28.200,00:28:30.685,00:00:02.485,,just a crazy crazy number
469,5,1,00:28:30.984,00:28:36.132,00:00:05.148,yeah so all we have to do is that we have to make a fraction this time all right,
470,5,1,00:28:36.212,00:28:37.699,00:00:01.487,,yeah a fraction
471,5,1,00:28:37.908,00:28:42.069,00:00:04.161,yeah because we're wait one minute,
472,5,1,00:28:46.978,00:28:47.317,00:00:00.339,yeah,
473,5,1,00:28:51.100,00:28:54.000,00:00:02.900,I'm not looking at this at all pause filler,
474,5,1,00:28:57.600,00:28:59.200,00:00:01.600,,all right hang on a sec
475,5,1,00:29:03.001,00:29:03.320,00:00:00.319,,okay
476,5,1,00:29:23.165,00:29:23.774,00:00:00.609,all right,
477,5,1,00:29:37.463,00:29:38.111,00:00:00.648,roger that,
478,5,1,00:29:40.885,00:29:43.479,00:00:02.594,all right so now you're going to tutor me,
479,5,1,00:29:43.888,00:29:44.906,00:00:01.018,,sweet
480,5,1,00:29:44.906,00:29:54.604,00:00:09.698,yeah so basically what's going to happen is that you're going to pause filler master the art of the pause filler this thing,
481,5,1,00:29:55.242,00:29:57.447,00:00:02.205,and it's going to be great,
482,5,1,00:29:57.447,00:30:02.117,00:00:04.670,like what you get used to it it's going to be sweet,
483,5,1,00:30:02.516,00:30:10.100,00:00:07.584,you're going to be like mastering pause filler as you animate people say it going Super Saiyan,
484,5,1,00:30:10.500,00:30:12.300,00:00:01.800,,yeah
485,5,1,00:30:10.997,00:30:14.369,00:00:03.372,yeah so pause filler weirdos,
486,5,1,00:30:14.519,00:30:19.068,00:00:04.549,anyway basically pause filler it's sort of hard to get used to,
487,5,1,00:30:19.068,00:30:22.590,00:00:03.522,but once you start to realize that it's just like a piece of paper,
488,5,1,00:30:23.079,00:30:24.426,00:00:01.347,it's really really easy,
489,5,1,00:30:24.855,00:30:29.455,00:00:04.600,,yeah like the one thing that gets me off is that you have like a smaller pad to draw on
490,5,1,00:30:29.455,00:30:31.201,00:00:01.746,,but then the pad gets so much larger
491,5,1,00:30:32.588,00:30:38.913,00:00:06.325,oh yeah basically what they use this for is that they're able to adjust the page,
492,5,1,00:30:38.943,00:30:39.881,00:00:00.938,but we're not,
493,5,1,00:30:40.080,00:30:44.181,00:00:04.101,like you have to be on like that side (inaudible) the thing that we on that side is okay,
494,5,1,00:30:44.401,00:30:47.254,00:00:02.853,so it's basically like telling us how big the page should be,
495,5,1,00:30:47.434,00:30:52.000,00:00:04.566,so it's sort of like an adaption process because you have to like,
496,5,1,00:30:53.010,00:30:57.841,00:00:04.831,on the screen you have to like get used to the size,
497,5,1,00:30:58.040,00:31:07.658,00:00:09.618,so basically if you're to do a straight line like this on this thing on that side it be like the way you'd want it to be drawn,
498,5,1,00:31:07.658,00:31:14.991,00:00:07.333,but if you're to do this and that page is like this it's going to like be really short,
499,5,1,00:31:15.610,00:31:17.306,00:00:01.696,,yeah oh
500,5,1,00:31:18.583,00:31:18.783,00:00:00.200,yeah,
501,5,1,00:31:19.002,00:31:20.928,00:00:01.926,,if only this is like heat sensitive
502,5,1,00:31:20.928,00:31:22.155,00:00:01.227,,so I can use my hands
503,5,1,00:31:22.724,00:31:23.791,00:00:01.067,,this would be so much easier
504,5,1,00:31:24.230,00:31:25.717,00:00:01.487,oh yeah definitely but,
505,5,1,00:31:25.717,00:31:27.343,00:00:01.626,and they don't have the mouses turned on,
506,5,1,00:31:27.343,00:31:28.690,00:00:01.347,so you can't I don't know,
507,5,1,00:31:29.169,00:31:32.222,00:00:03.053,,oh a mouse probably would've been the easiest
508,5,1,00:31:32.511,00:31:34.686,00:00:02.175,I know I'm used to using my mouse,
509,5,1,00:31:35.026,00:31:37.570,00:00:02.544,so and I'm good at drawing with my mouse,
510,5,1,00:31:39.545,00:31:42.918,00:00:03.373,,I just draw on the computer when I get very very bored
511,5,1,00:31:43.486,00:31:46.410,00:00:02.924,oh who doesn't draw on the computer whenever they get really bored,
512,5,1,00:31:47.168,00:31:47.527,00:00:00.359,,yeah
513,5,1,00:31:49.000,00:31:51.099,00:00:02.099,I have a YouTube channel,
514,5,1,00:31:52.865,00:31:54.661,00:00:01.796,,oh pause filler what's it called
515,5,1,00:31:54.920,00:31:56.517,00:00:01.597,pause filler negative pixel,
516,5,1,00:31:56.517,00:31:59.091,00:00:02.574,and it's not the way you'd think it be spelled,
517,5,1,00:31:59.690,00:32:05.945,00:00:06.255,pause filler n and it has the picture with dinosaur that I drew in two seconds,
518,5,1,00:32:06.205,00:32:16.200,00:00:09.995,so and it's N-E-G-A-T-I-V-E P-I-C-K-S-A-L,
519,5,1,00:32:16.500,00:32:18.247,00:00:01.747,,all right I'll find that
520,5,1,00:32:18.567,00:32:21.261,00:00:02.694,yeah what's yours,
521,5,1,00:32:21.919,00:32:28.773,00:00:06.854,,mine is you know I've been meaning to change it for a long time my parents have blocked some of the computer
522,5,1,00:32:28.773,00:32:30.310,00:00:01.537,,so I can't change it at all
523,5,1,00:32:30.988,00:32:32.844,00:00:01.856,,so it's still Charlie Sprenkel
524,5,1,00:32:32.844,00:32:37.404,00:00:04.560,,and it's a terrible channel it is so bad
525,5,1,00:32:37.404,00:32:40.726,00:00:03.322,,I upload a video three months and it has two views
526,5,1,00:32:41.574,00:32:42.732,00:00:01.158,oh my gosh,
527,5,1,00:32:42.732,00:32:43.430,00:00:00.698,,yeah
528,5,1,00:32:43.430,00:32:47.142,00:00:03.712,are you the really small like really really really small YouTuber,
529,5,1,00:32:48.409,00:32:51.671,00:00:03.262,,well I probably would've had more subscribers
530,5,1,00:32:51.721,00:32:55.363,00:00:03.642,,but I have blocks every corner I turn
531,5,1,00:32:55.772,00:32:58.067,00:00:02.295,,so I can't really upload any videos (inaudible)
532,5,1,00:32:58.296,00:33:01.998,00:00:03.702,oh pause filler I don't really have a schedule,
533,5,1,00:33:02.217,00:33:07.056,00:00:04.839,but I guess you could say my videos are a bit vulgar sometimes,
534,5,1,00:33:07.166,00:33:12.604,00:00:05.438,like basically I just play like random games,
535,5,1,00:33:12.604,00:33:19.678,00:00:07.074,or I just make a bunch of random videos when I don't feel like doing anything so because I have like no blocks from my computer,
536,5,1,00:33:19.778,00:33:28.797,00:00:09.019,so I just go I uploaded the video like three days ago of have you heard of the Elder Scrolls,
537,5,1,00:33:29.017,00:33:30.473,00:00:01.456,,yeah I've heard of that
538,5,1,00:33:30.473,00:33:35.851,00:00:05.378,yeah pause filler I basically I took a clip from the Elder Scrolls 4 of the imperial guard,
539,5,1,00:33:35.851,00:33:38.335,00:00:02.484,and he has the funniest dialogue ever,
540,5,1,00:33:38.395,00:33:41.119,00:00:02.724,so he's like stop you violated the law,
541,5,1,00:33:41.279,00:33:42.396,00:00:01.117,pay a quarter fine,
542,5,1,00:33:42.396,00:33:45.988,00:00:03.592,or serve your sentence your stolen goods and now forfeit,
543,5,1,00:33:45.988,00:33:50.598,00:00:04.610,and basically what I did and what I did is that I amplified it,
544,5,1,00:33:50.917,00:33:54.648,00:00:03.731,and I made it really loud,
545,5,1,00:33:55.297,00:33:58.929,00:00:03.632,so I made it as I call it,
546,5,1,00:33:59.038,00:34:03.359,00:00:04.321,I'm basically what happens is that it just like really loud,
547,5,1,00:34:03.568,00:34:06.551,00:00:02.983,it's like stop you violated the law you know,
548,5,1,00:34:06.651,00:34:09.375,00:00:02.724,and my friend listened to the video,
549,5,1,00:34:09.485,00:34:11.480,00:00:01.995,and he liked tied,
550,5,1,00:34:11.690,00:34:14.094,00:00:02.404,he was like oh you know,
551,5,1,00:34:15.241,00:34:17.866,00:00:02.625,,pause filler I'm going to find that channel when I get home
552,5,1,00:34:17.965,00:34:21.777,00:00:03.812,yeah so pause filler yours is Charlie Sprenkel,
553,5,1,00:34:22.096,00:34:24.381,00:00:02.285,,yeah and it's not spelled to how you would think it is
554,5,1,00:34:24.720,00:34:26.067,00:00:01.347,,Charlie spelled normal
555,5,1,00:34:26.117,00:34:31.125,00:00:05.008,,but then the last name is S-P-R-E-N-K-E-L
556,5,1,00:34:31.983,00:34:32.532,00:00:00.549,oh,
557,5,1,00:34:33.221,00:34:35.695,00:00:02.474,,yeah it's very strange
558,5,1,00:34:35.695,00:34:37.132,00:00:01.437,,it's a very strange name
559,5,1,00:34:37.401,00:34:40.414,00:00:03.013,are you able to change your profile picture or no,
560,5,1,00:34:41.103,00:34:43.747,00:00:02.644,,pause filler I did change my profile picture
561,5,1,00:34:44.206,00:34:45.124,00:00:00.918,what is it,
562,5,1,00:34:45.800,00:34:48.243,00:00:02.443,,I found it on Google
563,5,1,00:34:48.400,00:34:56.391,00:00:07.991,,someone did like pause filler an animated drawing of a Titan from a show and stuff like that
564,5,1,00:34:56.917,00:34:59.291,00:00:02.374,,and I don't feel like putting my picture up anywhere
565,5,1,00:34:59.750,00:35:00.809,00:00:01.059,oh yeah,
566,5,1,00:35:02.953,00:35:03.971,00:00:01.018,,all sweet this time
567,5,1,00:35:09.378,00:35:12.052,00:00:02.674,well we weren't doing anything,
568,5,1,00:35:15.155,00:35:15.754,00:00:00.599,all right,
569,5,1,00:35:24.145,00:35:26.829,00:00:02.684,I think I exited out the other one,
570,5,1,00:35:28.485,00:35:28.635,00:00:00.150,yeah,
571,5,1,00:35:38.343,00:35:39.111,00:00:00.768,all right,
572,5,1,00:35:39.271,00:35:39.729,00:00:00.458,,got it
573,5,1,00:35:43.421,00:35:46.634,00:00:03.213,yeah because I was closing something up there,
574,5,1,00:35:46.714,00:35:50.246,00:00:03.532,and I accidentally closed pause filler that one so pause filler,
575,5,1,00:35:51.902,00:35:53.598,00:00:01.696,yeah that's really cool,
576,5,1,00:35:53.628,00:35:55.474,00:00:01.846,all right so I'm going to get everything,
577,5,1,00:36:04.284,00:36:05.152,00:00:00.868,I'm good (laughter),
578,5,1,00:36:06.808,00:36:07.377,00:00:00.569,thank you,
579,5,1,00:36:07.856,00:36:08.434,00:00:00.578,see you later,
580,5,1,00:36:08.863,00:36:09.422,00:00:00.559,,all right
581,5,1,00:36:10.031,00:36:14.700,00:00:04.669,all right let's get this done and over with,
582,5,1,00:36:14.700,00:36:18.831,00:00:04.131,all right pause filler you have to teach me how to use this problem because I have no idea what I'm doing,
583,5,1,00:36:19.250,00:36:25.745,00:00:06.495,,okay so you have the x here
584,5,1,00:36:26.164,00:36:29.686,00:00:03.522,,the idea is you want to leave that x alone and don't touch it
585,5,1,00:36:30.754,00:36:34.415,00:00:03.661,,you want to actually add three to this three so
586,5,1,00:36:36.151,00:36:39.633,00:00:03.482,what if I heard this before,
587,5,1,00:36:41.888,00:36:43.924,00:00:02.036,,so yeah you add three
588,5,1,00:36:44.323,00:36:47.276,00:00:02.953,,and that gets you zero
589,5,1,00:36:48.074,00:36:52.175,00:00:04.101,,and yeah so then you know what to do from here right
590,5,1,00:36:52.574,00:36:54.849,00:00:02.275,pause filler maybe I'll check later,
591,5,1,00:36:55.567,00:36:58.920,00:00:03.353,,all right yeah so show me what you know
592,5,1,00:36:59.300,00:37:02.332,00:00:03.032,all right so pause filler basically what I get twenty-five,
593,5,1,00:37:02.332,00:37:03.060,00:00:00.728,and then I'm done,
594,5,1,00:37:04.447,00:37:05.784,00:00:01.337,,yeah twenty-five equals x
595,5,1,00:37:05.784,00:37:06.911,00:00:01.127,,. that is good
596,5,1,00:37:06.911,00:37:09.845,00:00:02.934,,I'm going to put a checkmark yay
597,5,1,00:37:09.934,00:37:11.760,00:00:01.826,all right we did it,
598,5,1,00:37:11.760,00:37:13.586,00:00:01.826,oh what page,
599,5,1,00:37:13.846,00:37:19.972,00:00:06.126,,okay so see if you do another one like this again
600,5,1,00:37:21.524,00:37:25.000,00:00:03.476,all right but this one we haven't done before,
601,5,1,00:37:25.479,00:37:26.587,00:00:01.108,do you know how to do this one,
602,5,1,00:37:27.036,00:37:27.315,00:00:00.279,,yeah
603,5,1,00:37:27.634,00:37:29.191,00:00:01.557,all right so tell me,
604,5,1,00:37:29.979,00:37:32.237,00:00:02.258,oh I went into full screen,
605,5,1,00:37:33.840,00:37:35.816,00:00:01.976,(laughter) all right I'm good now,
606,5,1,00:37:37.093,00:37:37.522,00:00:00.429,,all right
607,5,1,00:37:40.784,00:37:42.261,00:00:01.477,,so wait
608,5,1,00:37:45.673,00:37:47.040,00:00:01.367,,okay yeah all right
609,5,1,00:37:47.190,00:37:48.600,00:00:01.410,,let's go
610,5,1,00:37:53.226,00:37:55.361,00:00:02.135,,you're going to go
611,5,1,00:37:55.421,00:37:57.127,00:00:01.706,we didn't do this one yet,
612,5,1,00:37:57.127,00:37:58.205,00:00:01.078,so you have to touch me how to do it,
613,5,1,00:37:58.205,00:37:59.482,00:00:01.277,,all right all right
614,5,1,00:37:59.821,00:38:01.368,00:00:01.547,I know how to do it but (inaudible),
615,5,1,00:38:01.447,00:38:03.363,00:00:01.916,,okay so
616,5,1,00:38:03.363,00:38:04.411,00:00:01.048,we have to do it,
617,5,1,00:38:04.411,00:38:05.019,00:00:00.608,I'm sorry,
618,5,1,00:38:05.887,00:38:08.541,00:00:02.654,,so for this you want the y to be positive
619,5,1,00:38:08.541,00:38:12.552,00:00:04.011,,so you're actually going to add a y to the y okay
620,5,1,00:38:12.742,00:38:14.258,00:00:01.516,,I'll (inaudible) for a second
621,5,1,00:38:15.426,00:38:20.843,00:00:05.417,,and here you're also going to subtract the eighteen
622,5,1,00:38:20.843,00:38:23.188,00:00:02.345,,so you can do that
623,5,1,00:38:24.246,00:38:34.901,00:00:10.655,,so whenever you have like one positive number without positive or negative the idea is to get you want to add the opposite of that
624,5,1,00:38:35.071,00:38:39.022,00:00:03.951,,so you actually want to subtract eighteen from the eighteen
625,5,1,00:38:39.281,00:38:40.628,00:00:01.347,,and get zero
626,5,1,00:38:40.628,00:38:44.899,00:00:04.271,,but then you'd also going to subtract that eighteen from the twenty-three
627,5,1,00:38:46.724,00:38:53.170,00:00:06.446,actually I think what you do pause filler is that you'd subtract the twenty-three,
628,5,1,00:38:53.240,00:38:54.267,00:00:01.027,not the eighteen,
629,5,1,00:38:55.784,00:38:57.630,00:00:01.846,because you want to get y on this side,
630,5,1,00:38:58.997,00:38:59.386,00:00:00.389,right,
631,5,1,00:39:00.623,00:39:00.902,00:00:00.279,,yeah
632,5,1,00:39:01.202,00:39:02.708,00:00:01.506,oh all right yeah,
633,5,1,00:39:02.708,00:39:04.494,00:00:01.786,and then you do that,
634,5,1,00:39:04.494,00:39:06.869,00:00:02.375,and then you did twenty-three,
635,5,1,00:39:07.328,00:39:09.094,00:00:01.766,and then you'd minus twenty-three,
636,5,1,00:39:09.233,00:39:10.261,00:00:01.028,oops that's a two,
637,5,1,00:39:10.261,00:39:11.847,00:00:01.586,all right and then op,
638,5,1,00:39:14.322,00:39:18.383,00:00:04.061,then this is what my homework looks like so (laughter),
639,5,1,00:39:19.690,00:39:20.777,00:00:01.087,,so you do that
640,5,1,00:39:20.997,00:39:23.810,00:00:02.813,yeah pause filler and then you get negative five,
641,5,1,00:39:23.930,00:39:25.646,00:00:01.716,and then you get y,
642,5,1,00:39:26.374,00:39:28.190,00:00:01.816,and then that's what it equals,
643,5,1,00:39:28.370,00:39:30.505,00:00:02.135,,all right yeah that's good
644,5,1,00:39:31.553,00:39:32.171,00:00:00.618,,go with
645,5,1,00:39:32.421,00:39:32.959,00:00:00.538,I mean,
646,5,1,00:39:32.959,00:39:34.426,00:00:01.467,oh my god,
647,5,1,00:39:34.426,00:39:35.504,00:00:01.078,what is that a v,
648,5,1,00:39:35.983,00:39:37.509,00:00:01.526,,it's supposed to be a checkmark
649,5,1,00:39:37.509,00:39:40.851,00:00:03.342,,it's not like the pencil where mine just keep drawing out
650,5,1,00:39:41.021,00:39:41.410,00:00:00.389,,here we go
651,5,1,00:39:41.410,00:39:42.119,00:00:00.709,oh there you go,
652,5,1,00:39:42.298,00:39:42.957,00:00:00.659,there you got it,
653,5,1,00:39:43.216,00:39:46.668,00:00:03.452,,to complete checkmark thing all right
654,5,1,00:39:49.711,00:39:50.280,00:00:00.569,,oh wow
655,5,1,00:39:50.280,00:39:52.415,00:00:02.135,,okay let's see with this one now
656,5,1,00:39:54.401,00:40:03.161,00:00:08.760,,so here it's going to be confusing because now you have two variables and two numbers pause filler on different sides
657,5,1,00:40:03.680,00:40:08.628,00:00:04.948,,so one of the first things you actually want to do is you want to add k to both sides
658,5,1,00:40:09.337,00:40:14.305,00:00:04.968,,so yeah each k is going to receive a k
659,5,1,00:40:15.413,00:40:19.923,00:00:04.510,,and the positive k is going to become two k you know
660,5,1,00:40:19.923,00:40:25.600,00:00:05.677,ah yeah like has a y2k robot is taking over right yeah,
661,5,1,00:40:25.969,00:40:28.124,00:00:02.155,,yeah yeah stuff like that
662,5,1,00:40:28.124,00:40:28.453,00:00:00.329,yeah,
663,5,1,00:40:29.401,00:40:31.327,00:00:01.926,,and so you can go ahead
664,5,1,00:40:31.327,00:40:32.075,00:00:00.748,,and can do that
665,5,1,00:40:34.041,00:40:35.926,00:00:01.885,oh what not a two,
666,5,1,00:40:35.926,00:40:39.738,00:00:03.812,I don't want a two,
667,5,1,00:40:41.294,00:40:44.148,00:00:02.854,,pause filler hitting undo in this thing is so hard
668,5,1,00:40:44.886,00:40:46.163,00:00:01.277,it's easy for me,
669,5,1,00:40:46.163,00:40:47.340,00:00:01.177,you just got to get used to it,
670,5,1,00:40:48.039,00:40:48.368,00:00:00.329,,yeah
671,5,1,00:40:49.096,00:40:50.713,00:00:01.617,pause filler and then you get two k,
672,5,1,00:40:52.080,00:40:54.644,00:00:02.564,well that was like I've been drawing like perfect ks,
673,5,1,00:40:54.644,00:40:55.402,00:00:00.758,I'm on a streak,
674,5,1,00:40:56.100,00:40:59.493,00:00:03.393,so then what I do is minus thirty-six,
675,5,1,00:40:59.812,00:41:00.710,00:00:00.898,,that's right
676,5,1,00:41:01.798,00:41:03.354,00:00:01.556,minus thirty-six,
677,5,1,00:41:07.036,00:41:14.499,00:00:07.463,and then that would be negative fifty equals two k and then two k,
678,5,1,00:41:15.676,00:41:18.410,00:00:02.734,but not the k I don't want that so,
679,5,1,00:41:18.410,00:41:19.936,00:00:01.526,and then you divide that by two,
680,5,1,00:41:20.365,00:41:22.770,00:00:02.405,but then two divided by fifty,
681,5,1,00:41:26.002,00:41:28.637,00:00:02.635,pause filler two four pause filler,
682,5,1,00:41:32.800,00:41:33.944,00:00:01.144,,twenty-five
683,5,1,00:41:35.032,00:41:37.786,00:00:02.754,oh yeah I forgot,
684,5,1,00:41:37.955,00:41:38.793,00:00:00.838,twenty-five,
685,5,1,00:41:40.000,00:41:43.363,00:00:03.363,and then k equals twenty-five,
686,5,1,00:41:45.279,00:41:49.150,00:00:03.871,,yeah yeah that's correct
687,5,1,00:41:49.150,00:41:51.874,00:00:02.724,,all right so we got this page down
688,5,1,00:41:53.590,00:41:54.159,00:00:00.569,,all right
689,5,1,00:41:55.106,00:41:55.795,00:00:00.689,,oh my gosh
690,5,1,00:41:55.795,00:41:58.139,00:00:02.344,,this is really hard to do
691,5,1,00:41:59.726,00:42:00.095,00:00:00.369,,okay
692,5,1,00:42:00.095,00:42:04.335,00:00:04.240,all right this is basically like the same thing before it's like I flipped it around,
693,5,1,00:42:04.794,00:42:09.100,00:00:04.306,,yeah so let's see if you can do this without my instruction
694,5,1,00:42:08.500,00:42:10.000,00:00:01.500,all right let's do it,
695,5,1,00:42:30.500,00:42:31.500,00:00:01.000,there done,
696,5,1,00:42:31.500,00:42:32.608,00:00:01.108,,yeah there we go
697,5,1,00:42:32.608,00:42:34.906,00:00:02.298,,so yeah b equals two
698,5,1,00:42:35.085,00:42:35.804,00:00:00.719,,that's good
699,5,1,00:42:37.231,00:42:39.685,00:00:02.454,,I'm going to fix that real quickly
700,5,1,00:42:40.244,00:42:41.122,00:00:00.878,,yeah there we go
701,5,1,00:42:41.491,00:42:42.279,00:00:00.788,,there we go
702,5,1,00:42:42.339,00:42:43.466,00:00:01.127,yeah together yeah,
703,5,1,00:42:43.975,00:42:44.744,00:00:00.769,all right five,
704,5,1,00:42:46.500,00:42:52.755,00:00:06.255,all right nine wait hold on it's like the (inaudible) could just like skip the page if he doesn't want to do it,
705,5,1,00:42:52.755,00:42:55.479,00:00:02.724,that's sweet anyway all right,
706,5,1,00:42:55.000,00:42:55.600,00:00:00.600,,that's is cool
707,5,1,00:42:57.195,00:42:58.981,00:00:01.786,all right so all right,
708,5,1,00:42:59.702,00:43:02.773,00:00:03.071,,you know how to do this one right or do you not
709,5,1,00:43:02.773,00:43:03.870,00:00:01.097,I know how to do it,
710,5,1,00:43:03.870,00:43:06.085,00:00:02.215,but you need to like teach me because this one is new,
711,5,1,00:43:07.232,00:43:12.660,00:00:05.428,,all right so here you have negative nine g equals eighty-one
712,5,1,00:43:13.009,00:43:19.904,00:00:06.895,,so for you I would yeah you want to separate the negative nine and the g
713,5,1,00:43:20.482,00:43:27.107,00:00:06.625,,so what you're going to do is actually you're going to add nine to you should
714,5,1,00:43:27.107,00:43:27.197,00:00:00.090,what,
715,5,1,00:43:27.486,00:43:29.053,00:00:01.567,,you're going to add nine to each of these
716,5,1,00:43:29.881,00:43:31.427,00:00:01.546,,no you can add nine to the negative nine
717,5,1,00:43:31.767,00:43:35.309,00:00:03.542,,and then divide a positive nine by the eighty-one
718,5,1,00:43:35.708,00:43:36.526,00:00:00.818,all right,
719,5,1,00:43:37.813,00:43:40.806,00:00:02.993,that sounds pretty cool,
720,5,1,00:43:49.506,00:43:50.135,00:00:00.629,and then,
721,5,1,00:43:57.400,00:43:58.400,00:00:01.000,I'm done,
722,5,1,00:43:58.456,00:43:59.673,00:00:01.217,,all right that's good
723,5,1,00:44:04.047,00:44:04.725,00:00:00.678,,and here we go
724,5,1,00:44:04.861,00:44:07.037,00:00:02.176,,it looks sort of like a checkmark
725,5,1,00:44:07.317,00:44:08.259,00:00:00.942,yeah,
726,5,1,00:44:10.442,00:44:11.697,00:00:01.255,,all right
727,5,1,00:44:16.286,00:44:16.933,00:00:00.647,,so
728,5,1,00:44:18.720,00:44:20.137,00:00:01.417,,we've already done this right
729,5,1,00:44:20.137,00:44:21.300,00:00:01.163,,let me see
730,5,1,00:44:25.425,00:44:27.261,00:00:01.836,,yeah we've done something sort of like it
731,5,1,00:44:27.300,00:44:30.643,00:00:03.343,,but it's still a little bit different
732,5,1,00:44:31.261,00:44:36.160,00:00:04.899,,so here you have the tenth
733,5,1,00:44:36.160,00:44:38.256,00:00:02.096,,and you actually want to get right of that ten
734,5,1,00:44:38.256,00:44:40.341,00:00:02.085,,so we should go
735,5,1,00:44:40.341,00:44:42.815,00:00:02.474,,and take away ten from the ten
736,5,1,00:44:43.284,00:44:46.577,00:00:03.293,,but also from the eighty-two
737,5,1,00:44:48.971,00:44:51.535,00:00:02.564,,so you can get started on that
738,5,1,00:44:51.820,00:44:52.723,00:00:00.903,all right,
739,5,1,00:44:54.299,00:44:58.021,00:00:03.722,so minus that's not a minus,
740,5,1,00:45:01.004,00:45:04.266,00:00:03.262,minus ten minus ten ,
741,5,1,00:45:12.695,00:45:13.264,00:00:00.569,,yeah
742,5,1,00:45:16.005,00:45:18.103,00:00:02.098,oh no it's wrong,
743,5,1,00:45:17.651,00:45:18.239,00:00:00.588,,not yet
744,5,1,00:45:22.560,00:45:29.300,00:00:06.740,and then eight eight y equals seven oh,
745,5,1,00:45:30.377,00:45:30.796,00:00:00.419,,wow
746,5,1,00:45:35.845,00:45:38.010,00:00:02.165,y equals seven,
747,5,1,00:45:40.225,00:45:40.943,00:00:00.718,,there we go
748,5,1,00:45:46.570,00:45:47.628,00:00:01.058,,okay I don't
749,5,1,00:45:47.847,00:45:49.324,00:00:01.477,no I'm just kidding,
750,5,1,00:45:49.723,00:45:50.641,00:00:00.918,,I have no idea (laughter)
751,5,1,00:45:54.696,00:45:56.627,00:00:01.931,yeah that's fixed,
752,5,1,00:45:58.383,00:45:58.892,00:00:00.509,,yeah yeah
753,5,1,00:45:58.892,00:46:00.040,00:00:01.148,that was actually really good,
754,5,1,00:46:00.040,00:46:03.632,00:00:03.592,all right no page seven all right,
755,5,1,00:46:04.200,00:46:05.637,00:00:01.437,,oh we went up two pages
756,5,1,00:46:05.637,00:46:06.595,00:00:00.958,,I didn't notice that
757,5,1,00:46:08.261,00:46:11.202,00:00:02.941,,so this one is sort of the same
758,5,1,00:46:14.936,00:46:17.061,00:00:02.125,yeah but except this is a fourteen x,
759,5,1,00:46:17.061,00:46:18.887,00:00:01.826,how do I multiply that (laughter),
760,5,1,00:46:19.785,00:46:20.284,00:00:00.499,,so (inaudible)
761,5,1,00:46:20.822,00:46:21.651,00:00:00.829,twenty-five,
762,5,1,00:46:23.866,00:46:26.041,00:00:02.175,,yeah let's see
763,5,1,00:46:26.041,00:46:28.276,00:00:02.235,,this is so this is a positive sixty-five
764,5,1,00:46:28.276,00:46:29.642,00:00:01.366,,you're going to get rid of a sixty-five
765,5,1,00:46:30.301,00:46:34.541,00:00:04.240,,and also take away sixty-five from the one hundred seven
766,5,1,00:46:36.118,00:46:37.904,00:00:01.786,,I need to figure out what that is now
767,5,1,00:46:39.670,00:46:40.548,00:00:00.878,,that would be
768,5,1,00:46:44.469,00:46:44.848,00:00:00.379,,oh well
769,5,1,00:46:48.290,00:46:51.692,00:00:03.402,,so sixty plus forty is a hundred okay okay
770,5,1,00:46:51.692,00:46:53.359,00:00:01.667,remember you shouldn't be doing this for me,
771,5,1,00:46:54.037,00:46:59.056,00:00:05.019,,right I also want to get the answer like before you do
772,5,1,00:46:59.145,00:47:01.759,00:00:02.614,,so I make sure you get the right answer
773,5,1,00:47:01.929,00:47:02.238,00:00:00.309,yeah,
774,5,1,00:47:06.688,00:47:08.225,00:00:01.537,,this microphone is creeping me out
775,5,1,00:47:08.923,00:47:11.268,00:00:02.345,,it's like staring at me like a giant eye
776,5,1,00:47:11.318,00:47:13.732,00:00:02.414,I know it like has just like it's a ball,
777,5,1,00:47:14.431,00:47:14.840,00:00:00.409,,yeah
778,5,1,00:47:15.159,00:47:15.648,00:00:00.489,look at this,
779,5,1,00:47:16.466,00:47:17.583,00:00:01.117,,and they call it blue
780,5,1,00:47:17.583,00:47:18.701,00:00:01.118,,but it's white
781,5,1,00:47:18.701,00:47:22.652,00:00:03.951,no mine is called a snowball,
782,5,1,00:47:22.792,00:47:23.949,00:00:01.157,,mine is called blue (laughter)
783,5,1,00:47:27.117,00:47:28.500,00:00:01.383,oh well,
784,5,1,00:47:29.053,00:47:30.857,00:00:01.804,,all right so
785,5,1,00:47:33.158,00:47:38.077,00:00:04.919,,technically you're just going to secretly get rid of that
786,5,1,00:47:38.077,00:47:39.434,00:00:01.357,,that never showed up
787,5,1,00:47:41.659,00:47:44.881,00:00:03.222,,and so you have the fourteen x right now
788,5,1,00:47:44.881,00:47:45.939,00:00:01.058,,it's stationary
789,5,1,00:47:46.159,00:47:47.655,00:00:01.496,,this does nothing for now
790,5,1,00:47:48.962,00:47:50.918,00:00:01.956,,and you're also going to get rid of that
791,5,1,00:47:50.918,00:47:52.165,00:00:01.247,,so you can go ahead
792,5,1,00:47:52.165,00:47:54.080,00:00:01.915,,and get that first part down
793,5,1,00:47:54.889,00:47:55.447,00:00:00.558,all right pause filler,
794,5,1,00:48:09.057,00:48:10.606,00:00:01.549,I am like dead tired,
795,5,1,00:48:10.606,00:48:12.918,00:00:02.312,and I have piano practice after this,
796,5,1,00:48:13.017,00:48:15.083,00:00:02.066,,I have to go work at the zoo after this
797,5,1,00:48:15.602,00:48:17.178,00:00:01.576,,and that's five hours long
798,5,1,00:48:18.525,00:48:19.333,00:00:00.808,really,
799,5,1,00:48:19.573,00:48:20.720,00:00:01.147,oh my god,
800,5,1,00:48:21.500,00:48:28.103,00:00:06.603,,yeah so and usually it's just me walking the entire thing multiple times for no reason
801,5,1,00:48:28.303,00:48:29.231,00:00:00.928,that's fun,
802,5,1,00:48:29.690,00:48:31.994,00:00:02.304,no fair,
803,5,1,00:48:32.593,00:48:35.995,00:00:03.402,,yeah it's but I don't get paid
804,5,1,00:48:37.053,00:48:37.961,00:00:00.908,you don't get paid,
805,5,1,00:48:38.090,00:48:38.450,00:00:00.360,,no
806,5,1,00:48:38.450,00:48:40.016,00:00:01.566,oh so it's just volunteer work,
807,5,1,00:48:40.256,00:48:40.814,00:00:00.558,,sort of
808,5,1,00:48:40.814,00:48:41.742,00:00:00.928,,it's like an intern
809,5,1,00:48:41.922,00:48:44.187,00:00:02.265,,next year in high school I will get paid
810,5,1,00:48:45.005,00:48:45.414,00:00:00.409,ah,
811,5,1,00:48:47.739,00:48:48.696,00:00:00.957,fourteen,
812,5,1,00:48:50.881,00:48:52.747,00:00:01.866,,does fourteen in the fourteen
813,5,1,00:48:52.907,00:48:54.842,00:00:01.935,,no fourteen go in the four two
814,5,1,00:48:55.980,00:48:57.097,00:00:01.117,no,
815,5,1,00:48:58.953,00:49:03.000,00:00:04.047,so we're going to have to make a really really hard number,
816,5,1,00:49:03.343,00:49:05.857,00:00:02.514,no I'm just kidding all right,
817,5,1,00:49:05.857,00:49:09.729,00:00:03.872,so pause filler so basically x equals,
818,5,1,00:49:13.121,00:49:15.585,00:00:02.464,forty-two over fourteen,
819,5,1,00:49:15.585,00:49:17.930,00:00:02.345,that's negative all right,
820,5,1,00:49:19.925,00:49:22.649,00:00:02.724,,actually you can still simplify this
821,5,1,00:49:23.497,00:49:24.036,00:00:00.539,really,
822,5,1,00:49:24.435,00:49:28.586,00:00:04.151,,yeah so fourteen times two is twenty-eight
823,5,1,00:49:29.115,00:49:30.851,00:00:01.736,,and add another fourteen
824,5,1,00:49:30.851,00:49:33.113,00:00:02.262,,and you get forty-two
825,5,1,00:49:35.814,00:49:40.818,00:00:05.004,oh oh so wouldn't be that,
826,5,1,00:49:41.836,00:49:44.729,00:00:02.893,,well that answer is correct
827,5,1,00:49:44.729,00:49:47.968,00:00:03.239,,but to fully simplify you would have pause filler
828,5,1,00:49:48.550,00:49:49.419,00:00:00.869,,three
829,5,1,00:49:51.118,00:49:52.741,00:00:01.623,,right or is it negative
830,5,1,00:49:53.756,00:49:55.834,00:00:02.078,it would be negative because,
831,5,1,00:49:56.562,00:49:57.390,00:00:00.828,,yeah that's right
832,5,1,00:49:57.520,00:49:58.997,00:00:01.477,,negative plus negative is a positive
833,5,1,00:50:01.671,00:50:06.520,00:00:04.849,,so yeah that's either way would be correct
834,5,1,00:50:08.126,00:50:09.124,00:00:00.998,yeah so,
835,5,1,00:50:16.367,00:50:16.786,00:00:00.419,oh my god,
836,5,1,00:50:18.117,00:50:20.318,00:00:02.201,all right never mind I'm just kidding,

852,5,1,00:51:23.924,00:51:24.402,00:00:00.478,,okay
853,5,1,00:51:24.732,00:51:29.152,00:00:04.420,why the earth has to be round all right so,
854,5,1,00:51:29.720,00:51:31.586,00:00:01.866,,wait so wait what is this right there
855,5,1,00:51:32.564,00:51:32.903,00:00:00.339,what,
856,5,1,00:51:33.272,00:51:33.622,00:00:00.350,,that
857,5,1,00:51:34.160,00:51:35.038,00:00:00.878,that's a nine,
858,5,1,00:51:35.218,00:51:40.386,00:00:05.168,,okay to me that looks like how I draw my As so
859,5,1,00:51:40.386,00:51:44.846,00:00:04.460,as I said my handwriting is really really bad so,
860,5,1,00:51:45.155,00:51:47.590,00:00:02.435,,mine is terrible you have no idea
861,5,1,00:51:48.139,00:51:50.543,00:00:02.404,,this is me trying very hard to keep it neat
862,5,1,00:51:51.331,00:51:51.960,00:00:00.629,really,
863,5,1,00:51:52.010,00:51:52.309,00:00:00.299,,yeah
864,5,1,00:51:54.684,00:51:58.545,00:00:03.861,this is me trying to keep it this is like the normal way I write (laughter),
865,5,1,00:52:01.525,00:52:03.534,00:00:02.009,,well everybody has their styles of writing
866,5,1,00:52:03.733,00:52:07.175,00:00:03.442,yeah and teachers don't get that I don't know why,
867,5,1,00:52:07.315,00:52:07.854,00:00:00.539,,I know oh
868,5,1,00:52:10.859,00:52:13.471,00:00:02.612,this isn't going to be the way I want it,
869,5,1,00:52:13.471,00:52:16.305,00:00:02.834,so twenty-five equals nine negative,
870,5,1,00:52:17.552,00:52:18.160,00:00:00.608,,there we go
871,5,1,00:52:19.906,00:52:20.854,00:00:00.948,,correct again
872,5,1,00:52:22.640,00:52:24.885,00:00:02.245,,all right well this looks new
873,5,1,00:52:25.563,00:52:26.092,00:00:00.529,yeah,
874,5,1,00:52:26.952,00:52:30.712,00:00:03.760,,I'm going to have to review this in a few seconds all right
875,5,1,00:52:31.769,00:52:40.929,00:00:09.160,,so before you would just have like you could have like negative p minus it to eight minus p
876,5,1,00:52:41.248,00:52:45.229,00:00:03.981,,but now you actually have you do have ps
877,5,1,00:52:45.269,00:52:47.454,00:00:02.185,,but now one of the p is was an eight
878,5,1,00:52:48.162,00:52:57.481,00:00:09.319,,so what you're going to do to this number here and the p here is each of those will receive their very own p
879,5,1,00:52:58.309,00:53:03.647,00:00:05.338,,so that's right yeah okay
880,5,1,00:53:04.186,00:53:06.910,00:00:02.724,wait the sixteen gets on the variable,
881,5,1,00:53:08.506,00:53:10.302,00:00:01.796,,wait is this (inaudible)
882,5,1,00:53:15.201,00:53:17.950,00:00:02.749,,yeah or this might actually be a typo
883,5,1,00:53:19.100,00:53:23.242,00:00:04.142,no there's no way the sixteen could get a p of a variable,
884,5,1,00:53:19.265,00:53:20.478,00:00:01.213,,let's see
885,5,1,00:53:23.242,00:53:24.150,00:00:00.908,that's impossible,
886,5,1,00:53:29.259,00:53:33.629,00:00:04.370,,oh okay they did it in a way where I could not understand it
887,5,1,00:53:34.686,00:53:38.069,00:00:03.383,,the eight p receives so it becomes nine p
888,5,1,00:53:39.426,00:53:42.469,00:00:03.043,yeah like these college students are weird,
889,5,1,00:53:42.469,00:53:51.807,00:00:09.338,,yeah because they're saying like add five y plus six to the six which we actually really mean to the five y
890,5,1,00:53:53.494,00:53:58.183,00:00:04.689,,so I don't really understand why they're explaining it like that because it makes no sense
891,5,1,00:54:05.317,00:54:06.334,00:00:01.017,good god,
892,5,1,00:54:13.259,00:54:15.223,00:00:01.964,I get thirty-six,
893,5,1,00:54:19.330,00:54:23.216,00:00:03.886,and then the p would equal four because I said so,
894,5,1,00:54:23.216,00:54:24.114,00:00:00.898,all right let's go,
895,5,1,00:54:25.222,00:54:25.531,00:00:00.309,,yup
896,5,1,00:54:34.081,00:54:34.570,00:00:00.489,,there we go
897,5,1,00:54:35.967,00:54:41.066,00:00:05.099,,so yeah this is kind of like the same thing
898,5,1,00:54:41.265,00:54:45.027,00:00:03.762,,but yet now you need to subtract them right
899,5,1,00:54:48.849,00:54:51.961,00:00:03.112,,no you're going to add w to both sides again
900,5,1,00:54:52.669,00:54:55.074,00:00:02.405,,so let's see
901,5,1,00:54:55.263,00:54:56.012,00:00:00.749,,let's see this
902,5,1,00:55:04.427,00:55:07.050,00:00:02.623,forty w,
903,5,1,00:55:13.401,00:55:14.483,00:00:01.082,oh my god,
904,5,1,00:55:15.777,00:55:18.860,00:00:03.083,,the people who are in charge of this looked so bored
905,5,1,00:55:21.085,00:55:22.511,00:00:01.426,wait they're here,
906,5,1,00:55:22.511,00:55:24.836,00:00:02.325,,no they are in the room next to me
907,5,1,00:55:26.213,00:55:27.640,00:00:01.427,oh that's creepy oh,

911,5,1,00:55:36.021,00:55:37.846,00:00:01.825,and he was like hey Jordan what's up,
912,5,1,00:55:37.846,00:55:42.286,00:00:04.440,and I'm like I'm doing like this stuff with this kid I don't even know,
913,5,1,00:55:43.464,00:55:45.978,00:00:02.514,,oh wait my best friend's dad works here

915,5,1,00:55:47.674,00:55:49.550,00:00:01.876,,yeah that's really creepy now
916,5,1,00:55:50.226,00:55:51.669,00:00:01.443,,there's nothing stopping him
917,5,1,00:55:50.358,00:55:50.767,00:00:00.409,yeah he,
918,5,1,00:55:55.017,00:55:55.905,00:00:00.888,negative,
919,5,1,00:55:58.430,00:55:59.547,00:00:01.117,one sixty,
920,5,1,00:56:00.665,00:56:02.900,00:00:02.235,and then I divide that I hope,
921,5,1,00:56:02.900,00:56:04.626,00:00:01.726,and then forty,
922,5,1,00:56:05.963,00:56:10.612,00:00:04.649,and then w would equal four because I said so,
923,5,1,00:56:10.612,00:56:11.310,00:00:00.698,now that's good,
924,5,1,00:56:11.490,00:56:12.248,00:00:00.758,,wait hang on
