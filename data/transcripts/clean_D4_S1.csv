0,4,1,00:00:13.290,00:00:13.660,00:00:00.370,what,
1,4,1,00:08:51.580,00:08:52.000,00:00:00.420,,alright
2,4,1,00:10:05.925,00:10:07.641,00:00:01.716,so there's one on every page,
3,4,1,00:10:08.300,00:10:11.732,00:00:03.432,so I just go to there to go to the next problem,
4,4,1,00:10:12.032,00:10:14.227,00:00:02.195,and they work they do the problem,
5,4,1,00:11:44.542,00:11:45.768,00:00:01.226,you can start,
6,4,1,00:11:45.888,00:12:00.904,00:00:15.016,,okay so pause filler all right this thing's weird to control pause filler
7,4,1,00:12:25.029,00:12:29.679,00:00:04.650,,so is this how pause filler to start the equation
8,4,1,00:12:37.518,00:12:39.696,00:00:02.178,yeah so then the sixes cancel out,
9,4,1,00:12:39.925,00:12:40.065,00:00:00.140,,yeah
10,4,1,00:12:40.115,00:12:42.230,00:00:02.115,and then you add thirteen to six,
11,4,1,00:12:42.809,00:12:47.259,00:00:04.450,,yeah okay so you get x equals pause filler nineteen
12,4,1,00:12:47.000,00:12:48.000,00:00:01.000,pause filler,
13,4,1,00:12:53.737,00:12:57.236,00:00:03.499,,all right so fifteen equals negative eight plus p
14,4,1,00:13:00.026,00:13:01.047,00:00:01.021,,so you have fifteen
15,4,1,00:13:02.315,00:13:03.422,00:00:01.107,,and then you add eight
16,4,1,00:13:03.422,00:13:06.984,00:00:03.562,,because you undo the eights correct okay
17,4,1,00:13:07.054,00:13:07.283,00:00:00.229,yeah,
18,4,1,00:13:20.861,00:13:22.399,00:00:01.538,,and so the eights cancel out
19,4,1,00:13:22.688,00:13:24.105,00:00:01.417,,and then you get fifteen plus eight
20,4,1,00:13:24.324,00:13:29.832,00:00:05.508,,pause filler you get twenty-three
21,4,1,00:13:31.159,00:13:31.378,00:00:00.219,yeah,
22,4,1,00:13:31.688,00:13:44.229,00:00:12.541,,equals p okay all right so this problem works the same as everything else
23,4,1,00:13:44.898,00:13:45.227,00:00:00.329,pause filler yeah,
24,4,1,00:13:45.227,00:13:50.834,00:00:05.607,,okay so you use thirteen minus eleven
25,4,1,00:14:00.901,00:14:05.571,00:00:04.670,,seventeen minus eleven is six equals k
26,4,1,00:14:16.027,00:14:20.108,00:00:04.081,,so for this problem you would divide out the forty-four
27,4,1,00:14:20.477,00:14:20.796,00:00:00.319,yeah,
28,4,1,00:14:20.980,00:14:21.360,00:00:00.380,,okay
29,4,1,00:14:53.786,00:14:56.000,00:00:02.214,,forty-five so
30,4,1,00:15:00.900,00:15:05.584,00:00:04.684,,I have five because twenty two hundred twenty divided by forty-four is five
31,4,1,00:15:06.203,00:15:06.542,00:00:00.339,yeah,
32,4,1,00:15:11.870,00:15:13.579,00:00:01.709,,negative nine plus thirteen p 
33,4,1,00:15:46.350,00:15:47.070,00:00:00.720,,fifty
34,4,1,00:15:47.938,00:15:48.547,00:00:00.609,fifty,
35,4,1,00:15:48.826,00:15:55.266,00:00:06.440,,yeah so p equals fifty thirteenths 
36,4,1,00:16:23.849,00:16:38.543,00:00:14.694,,twenty twenty-four over six over six equals pause filler four okay
37,4,1,00:17:10.200,00:17:13.603,00:00:03.403,,forty plus twenty-two is sixty-two
38,4,1,00:17:12.000,00:17:13.000,00:00:01.000,pause filler,
39,4,1,00:17:24.000,00:17:31.000,00:00:07.000,,yeah sixty-two fifteenths equals k 
40,4,1,00:18:13.690,00:18:14.140,00:00:00.450,,yeah
41,4,1,00:18:14.417,00:18:15.173,00:00:00.756,yeah that's right,
42,4,1,00:18:15.403,00:18:18.985,00:00:03.582,,okay so they pretty much follow the same rules of just going
43,4,1,00:18:19.783,00:18:20.122,00:00:00.339,yeah,
44,4,1,00:18:20.242,00:18:20.608,00:00:00.366,,yeah all right so
45,4,1,00:18:25.310,00:18:26.190,00:00:00.880,,alright so
46,4,1,00:18:27.456,00:18:34.120,00:00:06.664,okay so what you do is you subtract this p,
47,4,1,00:18:34.819,00:18:35.228,00:00:00.409,,pause filler okay
48,4,1,00:18:35.487,00:18:36.854,00:00:01.367,pause filler from this p,
49,4,1,00:18:37.084,00:18:39.957,00:00:02.873,,okay so you want all the variables on one side
50,4,1,00:18:39.957,00:18:41.400,00:00:01.443,,and then you get the equation
51,4,1,00:18:59.173,00:18:59.364,00:00:00.191,,nope
52,4,1,00:19:06.530,00:19:11.720,00:00:05.190,,so you get fifteen equals four p
53,4,1,00:19:12.932,00:19:16.194,00:00:03.262,one two p because you're subtracting,
54,4,1,00:19:15.820,00:19:16.750,00:00:00.930,,oh okay thank you
55,4,1,00:19:24.542,00:19:26.391,00:00:01.849,,three because you subtract twelve
56,4,1,00:19:27.230,00:19:35.271,00:00:08.041,,and then you get three equals two p or one-point-five equals p
57,4,1,00:19:36.798,00:19:37.267,00:00:00.469,yup,
58,4,1,00:19:42.066,00:19:43.822,00:00:01.756,,you get pause filler k
59,4,1,00:19:43.822,00:19:48.222,00:00:04.400,,you'd subtract the k to get seven k
60,4,1,00:19:49.050,00:19:49.240,00:00:00.190,no,
61,4,1,00:19:50.068,00:19:50.247,00:00:00.179,,right
62,4,1,00:19:50.247,00:19:53.430,00:00:03.183,this the eight k would become the seven k,
63,4,1,00:19:53.550,00:19:56.363,00:00:02.813,,yeah and that equals ten
64,4,1,00:19:57.132,00:19:57.471,00:00:00.339,yeah,
65,4,1,00:19:57.621,00:20:00.594,00:00:02.973,,negative ten negative ten because there's a subtraction sign there
66,4,1,00:20:00.993,00:20:03.936,00:00:02.943,,then you add the sixty-eight to get
67,4,1,00:20:04.695,00:20:09.005,00:00:04.310,,pause filler seven k equals seventy-eight
68,4,1,00:20:10.412,00:20:17.635,00:00:07.223,,and then you get k equals pause filler seventy-eight sevenths
69,4,1,00:20:20.571,00:20:22.664,00:00:02.093,,that may or may not be reducible
70,4,1,00:20:22.664,00:20:24.579,00:00:01.915,,but that is the answer
71,4,1,00:20:24.968,00:20:25.348,00:00:00.380,yeah,
72,4,1,00:20:29.588,00:20:30.240,00:00:00.652,,okay
73,4,1,00:20:35.740,00:20:37.420,00:00:01.680,,do you have any idea where they are
74,4,1,00:20:38.228,00:20:38.897,00:00:00.669,nope,
75,4,1,00:20:39.226,00:20:40.012,00:00:00.786,,okay then
76,4,1,00:20:47.870,00:20:49.910,00:00:02.040,,they're somewhere near where I am
77,4,1,00:21:24.922,00:21:25.062,00:00:00.140,,what
78,4,1,00:21:26.566,00:21:27.941,00:00:01.375,,okay
79,4,1,00:21:32.086,00:21:32.146,00:00:00.060,yeah,
80,4,1,00:21:44.568,00:21:47.032,00:00:02.464,,all right so you have pause filler
81,4,1,00:21:47.381,00:21:50.384,00:00:03.003,,you subtract the r
82,4,1,00:21:50.384,00:21:52.619,00:00:02.235,,pause filler so you're left with one r
83,4,1,00:21:52.619,00:22:00.242,00:00:07.623,,so you get negative thirty-three equals pause filler r minus fifteen
84,4,1,00:22:00.841,00:22:03.275,00:00:02.434,,you add fifteen to both sides
85,4,1,00:22:05.041,00:22:12.000,00:00:06.959,,so you get pause filler negative thirty-three plus fifteen is negative twenty pause filler eighteen
86,4,1,00:22:16.075,00:22:17.236,00:00:01.161,,you have eighteen
87,4,1,00:22:20.636,00:22:20.994,00:00:00.358,yes,
88,4,1,00:22:21.050,00:22:23.480,00:00:02.430,,okay so yeah negative fifteen equals r
89,4,1,00:22:30.849,00:22:33.796,00:00:02.947,okay so it's the same thing,
90,4,1,00:22:34.235,00:22:37.557,00:00:03.322,,yeah okay so you subtract u
91,4,1,00:22:37.886,00:22:47.435,00:00:09.549,,and you get negative forty-two equals eight plus three u
92,4,1,00:22:48.935,00:22:53.680,00:00:04.745,,and then you get equals then you get
93,4,1,00:22:53.680,00:22:56.255,00:00:02.575,,then you subtract the eight
94,4,1,00:22:57.043,00:22:59.168,00:00:02.125,,so you get negative fifty
95,4,1,00:23:00.774,00:23:04.666,00:00:03.892,,fifty equals three u
96,4,1,00:23:04.666,00:23:06.771,00:00:02.105,,and you get pause filler
97,4,1,00:23:06.771,00:23:08.437,00:00:01.666,,you divide by three
98,4,1,00:23:08.437,00:23:17.200,00:00:08.763,,and you get negative fifty thirds equals u 
99,4,1,00:23:20.930,00:23:22.880,00:00:01.950,,okay just larger numbers
100,4,1,00:23:25.418,00:23:26.466,00:00:01.048,,so you subtract the n
101,4,1,00:23:26.715,00:23:28.172,00:00:01.457,,you get ninety-nine n
102,4,1,00:23:28.172,00:23:39.397,00:00:11.225,,so you get one hundred six equals pause filler ninety-nine n plus seven n seven
103,4,1,00:23:40.883,00:23:42.978,00:00:02.095,,and you subtract seven
104,4,1,00:23:42.978,00:23:47.139,00:00:04.161,,and you get ninety-nine n equals ninety nine
105,4,1,00:23:50.102,00:23:54.089,00:00:03.987,,so you get n equals one one 
106,4,1,00:23:59.770,00:24:04.949,00:00:05.179,,alright okay so subtract g
107,4,1,00:24:05.807,00:24:06.944,00:00:01.137,,subtract g
108,4,1,00:24:06.944,00:24:15.754,00:00:08.810,,you get fifty-five equals seven plus twelve g
109,4,1,00:24:15.000,00:24:16.000,00:00:01.000,pause filler,
110,4,1,00:24:15.993,00:24:16.871,00:00:00.878,,because you're subtracting
111,4,1,00:24:19.510,00:24:22.820,00:00:03.310,,and then you subtract the seven you get 
112,4,1,00:24:24.830,00:24:25.610,00:00:00.780,,get rid of that
113,4,1,00:24:27.058,00:24:32.466,00:00:05.408,,fifty-five minus seven is forty-eight equals twelve g
114,4,1,00:24:33.005,00:24:36.936,00:00:03.931,,pause filler you divide by twelve
115,4,1,00:24:37.026,00:24:40.129,00:00:03.103,,you get four equals g
116,4,1,00:24:41.765,00:24:41.885,00:00:00.120,good,
117,4,1,00:24:43.485,00:24:48.539,00:00:05.054,,okay negative eleven plus y equals twenty-four plus eight y
118,4,1,00:24:48.899,00:24:53.648,00:00:04.749,,subtract y good enough
119,4,1,00:24:54.925,00:25:04.633,00:00:09.708,,negative eleven equals pause filler twenty-four pause filler plus plus seven y
120,4,1,00:25:04.633,00:25:08.734,00:00:04.101,,pause filler you subtract the twenty-four
121,4,1,00:25:09.173,00:25:15.618,00:00:06.445,,you get negative thirty-five equals seven y
122,4,1,00:25:18.332,00:25:19.479,00:00:01.147,,and so you divide
123,4,1,00:25:19.599,00:25:22.003,00:00:02.404,,you get pause filler seven
124,4,1,00:25:22.203,00:25:25.927,00:00:03.724,,you get negative negative five (inaudible)
125,4,1,00:25:30.270,00:25:31.060,00:00:00.790,,equals
126,4,1,00:25:34.210,00:25:35.190,00:00:00.980,,yeah y
127,4,1,00:25:36.520,00:25:37.590,00:00:01.070,,there you go 
128,4,1,00:25:39.440,00:25:46.186,00:00:06.746,,okay so it's just the same principle you subtract all the ds you subtract them 
129,4,1,00:25:46.572,00:25:52.525,00:00:05.953,you could do the if you do the twenty-eight if you subtract the twenty-eight then you'll end up with a positive d,
130,4,1,00:25:52.574,00:25:53.641,00:00:01.067,,pause filler yeah it would be
131,4,1,00:25:53.971,00:25:54.929,00:00:00.958,,it would be a nicer number
132,4,1,00:25:54.929,00:25:56.236,00:00:01.307,,so you subtract the twenty-eight
133,4,1,00:25:56.415,00:26:03.469,00:00:07.054,,pause filler you get fifty-three minus twenty-eight which is pause filler fifty minus twenty-five
134,4,1,00:26:04.217,00:26:14.724,00:00:10.507,,so you have twenty-five d plus seventy equals equals nineteen
135,4,1,00:26:15.572,00:26:18.844,00:00:03.272,,subtract seventy seventy
136,4,1,00:26:18.844,00:26:22.735,00:00:03.891,,pause filler you subtract the seventy
137,4,1,00:26:22.995,00:26:25.918,00:00:02.923,,you get twenty-five
138,4,1,00:26:26.706,00:26:39.178,00:00:12.472,,twenty-five equals pause filler nineteen minus seventy is pause filler nine minus sixty is fifty-one
139,4,1,00:26:39.986,00:26:43.907,00:00:03.921,,negative fifty-one that seems about
140,4,1,00:26:43.907,00:26:44.895,00:00:00.988,yes,
141,4,1,00:26:44.895,00:26:45.753,00:00:00.858,,that seems about right
142,4,1,00:26:45.753,00:26:49.145,00:00:03.392,,you divide by twenty-five forgot the variable there
143,4,1,00:26:49.515,00:26:54.597,00:00:05.082,,you get d equals pause filler fifty-one twenty-fifths
144,4,1,00:27:01.320,00:27:01.810,00:00:00.490,,okay
145,4,1,00:27:03.692,00:27:09.828,00:00:06.136,,pause filler it's probably easier to do if you subtract the nine
146,4,1,00:27:09.828,00:27:13.161,00:00:03.333,,pause filler x nine x there we go
147,4,1,00:27:13.161,00:27:14.188,00:00:01.027,,pause filler you subtract the nine x
148,4,1,00:27:14.188,00:27:22.486,00:00:08.298,,you get one hundred two equals fifty-three pause filler plus ten x
149,4,1,00:27:27.970,00:27:39.471,00:00:11.501,,so pause filler one hundred two minus fifty-three is fifty-two minus three is forty-nine equals ten x
150,4,1,00:27:40.050,00:27:44.680,00:00:04.630,,so you get pause filler forty four-point-nine equals x 
151,4,1,00:27:47.580,00:27:48.010,00:00:00.430,,okay
152,4,1,00:27:51.510,00:27:55.754,00:00:04.244,,thirteen y plus twenty-seven pause filler it's easier to just subtract that y
153,4,1,00:27:57.252,00:28:07.577,00:00:10.325,,so you get twelve y plus twenty-seven equals negative seventy-three
154,4,1,00:28:09.652,00:28:11.608,00:00:01.956,,so you subtract the twenty-seven
155,4,1,00:28:12.845,00:28:22.956,00:00:10.111,,you get twelve y equals pause filler twenty-seven negative seventy-three a hundred negative one hundred
156,4,1,00:28:25.300,00:28:25.800,00:00:00.500,pause filler,
157,4,1,00:28:26.255,00:28:37.010,00:00:10.755,,okay and negative one hundred twelfths or y equals negative pause filler twenty-five thirds
158,4,1,00:28:38.138,00:28:45.730,00:00:07.592,,because you can reduce it okay pause filler a hundred okay
159,4,1,00:28:45.730,00:28:47.846,00:00:02.116,,so you subtract the five p
160,4,1,00:28:48.594,00:28:57.933,00:00:09.339,,so you get one hundred equals pause filler twenty p plus fifty
161,4,1,00:28:59.240,00:29:00.287,00:00:01.047,,subtract the fifty
162,4,1,00:29:00.287,00:29:05.675,00:00:05.388,,you get fifty equals twenty p
163,4,1,00:29:05.675,00:29:07.621,00:00:01.946,,pause filler you divide by twenty
164,4,1,00:29:07.621,00:29:13.228,00:00:05.607,,you get five halves equals p
165,4,1,00:29:18.805,00:29:19.234,00:00:00.429,,that's it
166,4,1,00:29:20.034,00:29:20.711,00:00:00.677,I guess so,
167,4,1,00:29:21.711,00:29:22.210,00:00:00.499,,okay then
168,4,1,00:29:26.510,00:29:28.526,00:00:02.016,,I'll go find the people
169,4,1,00:29:29.570,00:29:30.250,00:00:00.680,alright,
170,4,1,00:30:20.500,00:30:21.180,00:00:00.680,okay,
171,4,1,00:30:41.846,00:30:42.006,00:00:00.160,,okay
172,4,1,00:31:30.962,00:31:32.781,00:00:01.819,,that's great free candy
173,4,1,00:31:36.721,00:31:39.500,00:00:02.779,it's even better when you're in a game design lab,
174,4,1,00:31:40.040,00:31:41.160,00:00:01.120,,you have got a good point
175,4,1,00:31:49.672,00:31:51.299,00:00:01.627,,are you in a game design room
176,4,1,00:31:51.668,00:31:51.837,00:00:00.169,yup,
177,4,1,00:31:52.227,00:31:54.441,00:00:02.214,,oh I'm just sitting in some conference room
178,4,1,00:31:54.701,00:31:56.527,00:00:01.826,,they have a lot of magnets on a fridge
179,4,1,00:31:58.682,00:32:00.637,00:00:01.955,mine has a kitchenette,
180,4,1,00:32:01.017,00:32:01.386,00:00:00.369,,really
181,4,1,00:32:01.675,00:32:02.274,00:00:00.599,yup,
182,4,1,00:32:02.393,00:32:07.183,00:00:04.790,,it has pause filler has a fridge sink coffee microwave toaster
183,4,1,00:32:11.502,00:32:14.007,00:00:02.505,mine has a giant Samsung TV,
184,4,1,00:32:14.914,00:32:15.620,00:00:00.706,,oh that's cool
185,4,1,00:32:17.019,00:32:21.640,00:00:04.621,,yeah mine just has projectors and and a white board
186,4,1,00:33:20.281,00:33:26.053,00:00:05.772,,so my math class pause filler my math teacher who works at the high school pause filler
187,4,1,00:33:27.041,00:33:29.056,00:00:02.015,,so they just renovated our high school
188,4,1,00:33:29.056,00:33:30.024,00:00:00.968,,I go to Mount Lebanon
189,4,1,00:33:30.344,00:33:36.001,00:00:05.657,,and so his desk has punched through the tile before the first year of the high school
190,4,1,00:33:36.599,00:33:37.487,00:00:00.888,oh my gosh,
191,4,1,00:33:38.136,00:33:41.438,00:00:03.302,,because they decided to buy cheap tiles instead of like good tile
192,4,1,00:33:42.586,00:33:52.647,00:00:10.061,yeah at my school it's like over fifty years old and there's only single-paned windows and I swear there's no insulation it's awful,
193,4,1,00:33:59.347,00:34:02.300,00:00:02.953,,oh they've also had this strange bus problem
194,4,1,00:34:03.129,00:34:06.861,00:00:03.732,,so they have to bus a handful of kids every day
195,4,1,00:34:07.629,00:34:11.370,00:00:03.741,,and so the first day they had to bus like kids for between schools
196,4,1,00:34:11.470,00:34:15.598,00:00:04.128,,so they sent a tiny bus for an entire classroom of kids
197,4,1,00:34:17.037,00:34:18.793,00:00:01.756,,they couldn't fit everybody on the bus
198,4,1,00:34:19.862,00:34:22.685,00:00:02.823,that's that is like a bad idea,
199,4,1,00:34:24.471,00:34:31.515,00:00:07.044,,and then those same kids pause filler in the bus situation with those kids just got worse
200,4,1,00:34:33.715,00:34:40.175,00:00:06.460,wow yeah my one friend has like an old lady bus driver named Barb,
201,4,1,00:34:40.494,00:34:45.862,00:00:05.368,it's it's crazy she yells at everybody and hates everybody,
202,4,1,00:34:46.301,00:34:47.388,00:00:01.087,,oh that's not good
203,4,1,00:34:48.218,00:34:54.789,00:00:06.571,yeah she called the principal of our school like at least once or twice about this one kid in my class who's just annoying,
204,4,1,00:35:00.658,00:35:07.363,00:00:06.705,,yeah so I have this English teacher and he manages to spend the entire period talking
205,4,1,00:35:08.061,00:35:09.329,00:00:01.268,,we barely do anything
206,4,1,00:35:09.329,00:35:11.593,00:00:02.264,,because for the first five minutes he's not there
207,4,1,00:35:12.422,00:35:15.554,00:00:03.132,,and then for the last five minutes he lets us leave early
208,4,1,00:35:15.634,00:35:17.171,00:00:01.537,,well he lets the other periods leave early
209,4,1,00:35:17.171,00:35:18.308,00:00:01.137,,because they have to go to lunch
210,4,1,00:35:18.318,00:35:24.155,00:00:05.837,,and so for the thirty-something minutes in between he talks
211,4,1,00:35:24.155,00:35:25.212,00:00:01.057,,and we do worksheets
212,4,1,00:35:25.252,00:35:26.240,00:00:00.988,,it's really boring
213,4,1,00:35:27.946,00:35:33.015,00:00:05.069,yeah my history teacher she'll start talking about the lesson,
214,4,1,00:35:33.015,00:35:39.251,00:00:06.236,and she rambles a little bit and then she keeps talking and then we read and she gives us work and then we leave,
215,4,1,00:35:39.510,00:35:40.647,00:00:01.137,and it's crazy,
216,4,1,00:35:43.038,00:35:46.975,00:00:03.937,my homeroom teacher lectures us like at least once a week,
217,4,1,00:35:47.975,00:35:58.000,00:00:10.025,like he yells at us and he gets really mad and it's almost funny and you hate him and it's just a routine now which is sort of bad but sort of funny,
218,4,1,00:36:02.538,00:36:06.329,00:00:03.791,,I had a homeroom teacher but I've only been there like two days
219,4,1,00:36:07.047,00:36:12.415,00:00:05.368,,because the other days I've been sitting outside a stairwell waiting to go up to a class at the high school
220,4,1,00:36:12.415,00:36:12.445,00:00:00.030,oh,
221,4,1,00:36:14.405,00:36:17.264,00:00:02.859,,and I'm with a few other kids
222,4,1,00:36:17.264,00:36:22.000,00:00:04.736,,and because no teacher is ever there we just play on our phones the entire time
223,4,1,00:36:29.080,00:36:30.860,00:00:01.780,, our school's administrative people
224,4,1,00:36:31.761,00:36:33.058,00:00:01.297,,probably don't know about it
225,4,1,00:36:35.958,00:36:38.715,00:00:02.757,my one friend at she goes to Hampton,
226,4,1,00:36:38.925,00:36:40.880,00:00:01.955,it was so funny,
227,4,1,00:36:41.320,00:36:42.976,00:00:01.656,she said there was this one kid,
228,4,1,00:36:43.145,00:36:55.058,00:00:11.913,and they were in the reading or something like that some sort of library or whatever and the teacher had turned around (laughs) and this kid had his camera on (laughter),
229,4,1,00:36:57.558,00:37:03.147,00:00:05.589,he took a picture (laughter) and it made it look like (laughter),
230,4,1,00:37:05.086,00:37:07.433,00:00:02.347,and she started yelling at everybody,
231,4,1,00:37:09.530,00:37:10.570,00:00:01.040,it was so funny,
232,4,1,00:37:12.808,00:37:15.252,00:00:02.444,,I hate how when like one kid does something wrong
233,4,1,00:37:15.412,00:37:17.278,00:00:01.866,,and then the teacher yells at everybody
234,4,1,00:37:17.390,00:37:22.306,00:00:04.916,thank you that is my class every single period of every single day,
235,4,1,00:37:31.040,00:37:33.460,00:00:02.420,the teacher is gonna tell us all before we gonna graduate,
236,4,1,00:38:04.630,00:38:04.910,00:00:00.280,mmhhm,
237,4,1,00:38:14.190,00:38:14.700,00:00:00.510,yay,
238,4,1,00:38:18.570,00:38:19.500,00:00:00.930,okay so,
239,4,1,00:38:22.990,00:38:27.000,00:00:04.010,,so uh do you need any help solving this or do you think you know what you are doing
240,4,1,00:38:27.100,00:38:28.360,00:00:01.260,I think I got this,
241,4,1,00:38:28.720,00:38:28.960,00:00:00.240,,ok
242,4,1,00:38:29.330,00:38:31.110,00:00:01.780,,if you do anything wrong I will just tell you
243,4,1,00:38:35.540,00:38:37.310,00:00:01.770,,yeah the pen's a little weird to use
244,4,1,00:39:00.393,00:39:03.107,00:00:02.714,,so you're pause filler doing what here
245,4,1,00:39:04.175,00:39:05.153,00:00:00.978,I add the opposite,
246,4,1,00:39:05.153,00:39:06.430,00:00:01.277,it's really weird,
247,4,1,00:39:06.589,00:39:07.797,00:00:01.208,,yeah yeah I I see
248,4,1,00:39:07.797,00:39:11.269,00:00:03.472,instead of subtracting my teacher yells at us to do it so,
249,4,1,00:39:12.047,00:39:14.451,00:00:02.404,,oh you guys add the inverse interesting
250,4,1,00:39:14.731,00:39:19.071,00:00:04.340,yeah it's really it's really weird my math teacher is a nut job,
251,4,1,00:39:20.071,00:39:23.222,00:00:03.151,,I had one math teacher who was just pause filler crazy
252,4,1,00:39:23.222,00:39:26.684,00:00:03.462,,he spent one day like talking about pirates
253,4,1,00:39:27.582,00:39:28.510,00:00:00.928,what (laughs),
254,4,1,00:39:29.846,00:39:35.900,00:00:06.054,,and skiers because it was for lines so twenty-three minus fifteen
255,4,1,00:39:40.228,00:39:42.106,00:00:01.878,wow this is really weird,
256,4,1,00:39:52.854,00:39:57.115,00:00:04.261,(inaudible) y is equal to negative five,
257,4,1,00:39:57.324,00:39:58.481,00:00:01.157,,yup that's it
258,4,1,00:39:59.270,00:40:00.477,00:00:01.207,that's easy,
259,4,1,00:40:01.854,00:40:09.150,00:00:07.296,okay so that's negative k equals what the,
260,4,1,00:40:13.717,00:40:23.458,00:00:09.741,fourteen equals thirty-six plus k,
261,4,1,00:40:24.800,00:40:25.430,00:00:00.630,,yeah
262,4,1,00:40:26.161,00:40:31.277,00:00:05.116,all right so k  ,
263,4,1,00:40:35.190,00:40:36.270,00:00:01.080,add k,
264,4,1,00:40:39.040,00:40:50.048,00:00:11.008,now you have fourteen is equal to thirty-six plus two k,
265,4,1,00:40:54.300,00:40:59.047,00:00:04.747,,you have some space kind of over on that side
266,4,1,00:41:00.141,00:41:21.630,00:00:21.489,okay moving over here now pause filler okay fourteen equal to thirty-six plus two k ,
267,4,1,00:41:29.630,00:41:39.851,00:00:10.221,six okay thirty-six pause filler ,
268,4,1,00:41:57.900,00:42:07.110,00:00:09.210,okay so that's negative twenty-five two k finally done,
269,4,1,00:42:07.651,00:42:09.166,00:00:01.515,,what did you get for that last one
270,4,1,00:42:09.505,00:42:10.731,00:00:01.226,negative twenty-five,
271,4,1,00:42:11.838,00:42:13.133,00:00:01.295,,yeah that seems right
272,4,1,00:42:21.802,00:42:22.977,00:00:01.175,okay that's weird pause filler,
273,4,1,00:42:29.506,00:42:31.244,00:00:01.738,okay I see how I can do this,
274,4,1,00:42:33.454,00:42:51.279,00:00:17.825,I guess that's seventeen plus negative b equals thirteen b no wait plus b sorry,
275,4,1,00:42:53.579,00:43:15.900,00:00:22.321,so that's plus negative b negative two b equal what the what did I just do,
276,4,1,00:43:17.810,00:43:19.637,00:00:01.827,,it should equal thirteen I think
