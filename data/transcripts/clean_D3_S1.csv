23,3,1,00:01:22.690,00:01:29.420,00:00:06.730,huh okay it depends oh there okay that would make it okay oh so probably negative three,
24,3,1,00:01:29.890,00:01:30.790,00:00:00.900,oh that was a great three,
25,3,1,00:01:31.700,00:01:34.630,00:00:02.930,plus x equals twenty-two,
26,3,1,00:01:34.970,00:01:35.535,00:00:00.565,,wait I can't
27,3,1,00:01:36.067,00:01:36.950,00:00:00.883,can you see that,
28,3,1,00:01:37.451,00:01:38.540,00:00:01.089,,wait should I go on page

38,3,1,00:02:15.080,00:02:20.363,00:00:05.283,,I see green on most of the pages I just can't see the problem
39,3,1,00:02:21.600,00:02:28.614,00:00:07.014,okay pause filler see it says it's like on the top it says scribbler room hw seven bchn five,
40,3,1,00:02:30.730,00:02:32.970,00:00:02.240,I don't know if you saw that,

44,3,1,00:02:41.010,00:02:46.258,00:00:05.248, I can't view what room you're on all I can see is your yeah,
45,3,1,00:02:48.038,00:02:50.070,00:00:02.032,,is it x minus six equals thirteen
46,3,1,00:02:51.074,00:02:56.212,00:00:05.138,x minus no but I'll try from that one here,
47,3,1,00:02:56.990,00:03:00.590,00:00:03.600,,wait is it three plus x equals twenty-two
48,3,1,00:03:01.440,00:03:04.720,00:00:03.280,three plus yeah I think that one can you see everything on that page,
49,3,1,00:03:05.800,00:03:09.550,00:00:03.750,,yeah I see all the like mint green scribble stuff
50,3,1,00:03:09.780,00:03:12.226,00:00:02.446,yeah that was actually okay,
51,3,1,00:03:13.178,00:03:15.540,00:00:02.362,so yeah okay I can see you,

59,3,1,00:03:28.260,00:03:30.520,00:00:02.260,so uhh do you know any algebra,
60,3,1,00:03:31.045,00:03:32.820,00:00:01.775,,yeah I'm an algebra one this year
61,3,1,00:03:33.640,00:03:35.840,00:00:02.200,yeah pause filler so am I,
62,3,1,00:03:35.885,00:03:37.210,00:00:01.325,,so what grade are you in
63,3,1,00:03:37.670,00:03:38.580,00:00:00.910,I'm in seventh grade,
64,3,1,00:03:38.815,00:03:39.690,00:00:00.875,,oh I'm in eighth grade
65,3,1,00:03:42.650,00:03:49.340,00:00:06.690,yeah umm so I guess we're supposed to work through these problems,
66,3,1,00:03:51.250,00:03:51.510,00:00:00.260,not,
67,3,1,00:03:52.230,00:03:57.230,00:00:05.000,,all right so just get rid of the scribbles I guess so that
68,3,1,00:03:57.420,00:03:59.050,00:00:01.630,okay so umm,
69,3,1,00:04:02.780,00:04:05.790,00:00:03.010,so like what I do is before I started erasing the problem,
70,3,1,00:04:06.300,00:04:08.460,00:00:02.160,so I think I'm just going to have to rewrite that problem,
71,3,1,00:04:10.224,00:04:13.650,00:00:03.426,and that did okay adjacent pencil,
72,3,1,00:04:14.400,00:04:22.765,00:00:08.365,let's see three plus x equals twenty-two,
73,3,1,00:04:23.387,00:04:23.750,00:00:00.363,,all right
74,3,1,00:04:27.580,00:04:31.340,00:00:03.760,so I assume you probably know how to solve this one,
75,3,1,00:04:31.780,00:04:35.164,00:00:03.384,,yes umm so are you tutoring me first
76,3,1,00:04:35.646,00:04:37.020,00:00:01.374,that's what I think they said,
77,3,1,00:04:37.318,00:04:37.660,00:00:00.342,,okay
78,3,1,00:04:38.580,00:04:46.640,00:00:08.060,so I guess umm you need to get x on leave only a thing on one side,
79,3,1,00:04:46.811,00:04:48.570,00:00:01.759,so you're going to have to get rid of three,
80,3,1,00:04:49.006,00:04:51.996,00:00:02.990,,yeah so would you have to subtract three from both sides
81,3,1,00:04:52.637,00:04:55.466,00:00:02.829,umm yeah so can you do it on there,
82,3,1,00:04:55.880,00:04:56.174,00:00:00.294,,yeah
83,3,1,00:04:56.550,00:04:56.930,00:00:00.380,,do you see
84,3,1,00:04:57.383,00:04:57.520,00:00:00.137,yup,
85,3,1,00:05:02.920,00:05:04.710,00:00:01.790,,and then this cancels out
86,3,1,00:05:05.370,00:05:10.580,00:00:05.210,,so then you're just left with x equals
87,3,1,00:05:14.218,00:05:14.398,00:00:00.180,,huh
88,3,1,00:05:15.580,00:05:16.314,00:00:00.734,,oh okay it's working
89,3,1,00:05:17.830,00:05:18.490,00:00:00.660,,all right great
90,3,1,00:05:25.580,00:05:30.350,00:00:04.770,,all right so we had to go on a different page we went on this page with this equals x
91,3,1,00:05:35.420,00:05:35.984,00:00:00.564,,yeah
92,3,1,00:05:38.747,00:05:42.880,00:00:04.133,,wait are you on the yeah okay great great all right thank you
93,3,1,00:05:46.480,00:05:53.070,00:00:06.590,yeah accidentally got like this it's like over the things you can't really erase,
94,3,1,00:05:56.110,00:05:56.560,00:00:00.450,so,
95,3,1,00:06:07.100,00:06:10.420,00:00:03.320,because it's like we loaded the page for some reason,
96,3,1,00:06:14.950,00:06:18.978,00:00:04.028,okay yeah so they exactly know what's happening,
97,3,1,00:06:20.308,00:06:21.330,00:00:01.022,now this pen is sort of cool,
98,3,1,00:06:24.109,00:06:25.240,00:00:01.131,,so what school do you go to
99,3,1,00:06:25.727,00:06:26.980,00:00:01.253,I go to SciTech what about you,
100,3,1,00:06:27.460,00:06:29.460,00:00:02.000,,oh I go to West Allegheny yeah
101,3,1,00:06:30.600,00:06:30.650,00:00:00.050,yeah,
102,3,1,00:06:34.093,00:06:35.930,00:00:01.837,,so is math your favorite subject
103,3,1,00:06:36.690,00:06:41.231,00:00:04.541,I mean I like math because it I mean it's sort of fun,
104,3,1,00:06:41.231,00:06:47.770,00:00:06.539,but you got yeah homework listed and all that those are unfun stuff,
105,3,1,00:06:47.810,00:06:48.290,00:00:00.480,,yeah
106,3,1,00:07:05.930,00:07:09.282,00:00:03.352,,all right so are you on the same page
107,3,1,00:07:10.510,00:07:13.648,00:00:03.138,yeah I'm on the same page umm did they change your page or,
108,3,1,00:07:14.498,00:07:16.250,00:00:01.752,,umm x minus six equals thirteen
109,3,1,00:07:17.270,00:07:22.527,00:00:05.257,umm no pause filler I don't know I don't know so you want me to get to that one let's see is that one it,
110,3,1,00:07:24.460,00:07:26.687,00:00:02.227,no that is not it,
111,3,1,00:07:26.800,00:07:27.200,00:00:00.400,,well so
112,3,1,00:07:27.200,00:07:29.150,00:00:01.950,yeah saw it yeah I'm on this page now,
113,3,1,00:07:29.490,00:07:30.109,00:00:00.619,,all right great
114,3,1,00:07:30.550,00:07:35.250,00:00:04.700,,so you're going to work me through these problems I guess
115,3,1,00:07:36.020,00:07:44.960,00:00:08.940,okay so umm as we're doing equal so I wonder if I can circle all right here,
116,3,1,00:07:48.230,00:07:48.880,00:00:00.650,done huh,
117,3,1,00:07:49.880,00:07:50.810,00:00:00.930,yeah you're going to have to get rid of that six,
118,3,1,00:07:51.640,00:07:54.200,00:00:02.560,,yeah so you would have to add six right
119,3,1,00:07:54.940,00:07:57.920,00:00:02.980,yeah so do you want to add six to both of those sides,
120,3,1,00:08:00.332,00:08:01.190,00:00:00.858,,oh gosh (laughter)
121,3,1,00:08:01.760,00:08:03.940,00:00:02.180,I know this writing with this stuff is so weird,
122,3,1,00:08:04.490,00:08:08.320,00:00:03.830,,so you add six and then you get x equals nineteen
123,3,1,00:08:09.600,00:08:10.160,00:00:00.560,,oh gosh
124,3,1,00:08:15.140,00:08:16.940,00:00:01.800,so okay,
125,3,1,00:08:17.640,00:08:18.775,00:00:01.135,,oh that didn't work yeah
126,3,1,00:08:19.630,00:08:22.550,00:00:02.920,but do you know how to get to the next problem,
127,3,1,00:08:23.912,00:08:27.430,00:00:03.518,,yeah we go onto the next page
128,3,1,00:08:27.750,00:08:36.150,00:00:08.400,oh okay pause filler okay for this one it's sort of the same thing so you want to get or does the eight,
129,3,1,00:08:36.775,00:08:38.950,00:00:02.175,,yeah and that's a negative so you would have to add it
130,3,1,00:08:39.529,00:08:41.170,00:00:01.641,yeah just like the last one,
131,3,1,00:08:49.410,00:08:50.410,00:00:01.000,,oh gosh
132,3,1,00:08:56.730,00:08:58.990,00:00:02.260,okay that was it not bad,
133,3,1,00:08:59.480,00:09:05.140,00:00:05.660,,fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two
134,3,1,00:09:09.580,00:09:11.460,00:00:01.880,,all right next page right
135,3,1,00:09:13.461,00:09:14.260,00:00:00.799,yup there we go,
136,3,1,00:09:16.158,00:09:22.440,00:00:06.282,okay pause filler so this one is a lot like the other ones except for this one yeah you don't want to add it,
137,3,1,00:09:23.050,00:09:24.630,00:00:01.580,,yeah so you have to subtract
138,3,1,00:09:25.690,00:09:31.850,00:00:06.160,,so you would subtract eleven because it's a positive right
139,3,1,00:09:32.081,00:09:32.370,00:00:00.289,yeah,
140,3,1,00:09:32.950,00:09:34.500,00:00:01.550,,all right so minus eleven
141,3,1,00:09:42.428,00:09:45.380,00:00:02.952,,then those who cancel out so it would be k equals six
142,3,1,00:09:45.940,00:09:46.160,00:00:00.220,yeah,
143,3,1,00:09:47.940,00:09:50.320,00:00:02.380,,oh gosh this is so messy
144,3,1,00:09:56.900,00:10:06.372,00:00:09.472,okay so this time we yeah only one term on the other side so yeah,
145,3,1,00:10:07.241,00:10:11.241,00:00:04.000,so you want to get rid of the forty-four so the coefficient of x is one,
146,3,1,00:10:12.150,00:10:12.570,00:00:00.420,,yeah
147,3,1,00:10:12.150,00:10:12.560,00:00:00.410,so,
148,3,1,00:10:15.420,00:10:16.360,00:00:00.940,do you know how to do that,
149,3,1,00:10:16.460,00:10:23.800,00:00:07.340,,yeah yeah yeah yeah so you'd have to divide because it's multiplication then you do the opposites so divided by forty
150,3,1,00:10:23.370,00:10:23.529,00:00:00.159,yeah,
151,3,1,00:10:25.100,00:10:26.770,00:00:01.670,,it's so weird because I have to like
152,3,1,00:10:27.940,00:10:34.340,00:00:06.400,,I have to take a moment to think now because I'm so accustomed in my class to using calculators like she lets us
153,3,1,00:10:34.375,00:10:35.910,00:00:01.535,I know yeah,
154,3,1,00:10:36.570,00:10:37.080,00:00:00.510,,so divide it
155,3,1,00:10:37.720,00:10:39.670,00:00:01.950,on personal calculators and I just pull it up,
156,3,1,00:10:40.050,00:10:40.570,00:00:00.520,,yeah
157,3,1,00:10:42.157,00:10:47.997,00:00:05.840,,wait oh gosh is this what even what even is this then
158,3,1,00:10:52.800,00:10:53.240,00:00:00.440,,ten
159,3,1,00:10:55.230,00:10:56.290,00:00:01.060,,x equals
160,3,1,00:10:58.375,00:11:01.700,00:00:03.325,,twenty-two divided two hundred and twenty divided by forty-four
161,3,1,00:11:03.670,00:11:04.400,00:00:00.730,yeah I wonder if I could,
162,3,1,00:11:05.478,00:11:09.110,00:00:03.632,umm so that's like a forty-four on that side,
163,3,1,00:11:09.419,00:11:11.110,00:00:01.691,that was lovely okay I know what I mean,
164,3,1,00:11:11.910,00:11:13.210,00:00:01.300,and two hundred twenty,
165,3,1,00:11:14.515,00:11:17.180,00:00:02.665,see you can go I see like umm,
166,3,1,00:11:18.472,00:11:19.480,00:00:01.008,,yeah yeah yeah yeah
167,3,1,00:11:19.929,00:11:25.850,00:00:05.921,I just yeah okay how many times it's like about five five ten,
168,3,1,00:11:26.610,00:11:28.150,00:00:01.540,,oh yeah that would make sense so
169,3,1,00:11:28.220,00:11:29.600,00:00:01.380,and maybe it's five,
170,3,1,00:11:29.775,00:11:30.410,00:00:00.635,,yeah it
171,3,1,00:11:36.150,00:11:38.097,00:00:01.947,that was not how it's supposed to,
172,3,1,00:11:38.167,00:11:41.800,00:00:03.633,,it seems so embarrassing because it's just like we're so used to using calculators but it just
173,3,1,00:11:42.548,00:11:42.990,00:00:00.442,,yeah
174,3,1,00:11:43.660,00:11:46.720,00:00:03.060,okay let's see that's zero,
175,3,1,00:11:47.980,00:11:50.733,00:00:02.753,it's a two yeah a two,
176,3,1,00:11:51.353,00:11:53.790,00:00:02.437,four times that that's also yeah it's five,
177,3,1,00:11:55.230,00:11:55.930,00:00:00.700,,all right great
178,3,1,00:11:58.600,00:12:02.860,00:00:04.260,,so are you an advanced then because you're an algebra in the seventh grade
179,3,1,00:12:04.060,00:12:10.890,00:00:06.830,umm yes so what I'm doing at the moment I'm taking a full year of algebra one but at the same time I'm also taking geometry,
180,3,1,00:12:11.130,00:12:11.813,00:00:00.683,,oh god
181,3,1,00:12:12.330,00:12:12.860,00:00:00.530,yeah so,
182,3,1,00:12:12.870,00:12:17.870,00:00:05.000,,like I I'm not in like there's like three levels of math
183,3,1,00:12:17.985,00:12:21.080,00:00:03.095,,there's like the low math who don't like get as quickly
184,3,1,00:12:21.109,00:12:22.590,00:00:01.481,,there isjust like the regular math
185,3,1,00:12:23.016,00:12:24.870,00:00:01.854,,and then there's the advanced math
186,3,1,00:12:25.260,00:12:26.723,00:00:01.463,,I'm in just like the regular math
187,3,1,00:12:27.277,00:12:29.820,00:00:02.543,,and I'm like right where I should be in my grade
188,3,1,00:12:30.197,00:12:34.150,00:00:03.953,,and English is more my subject like I'm in advanced English all the time but
189,3,1,00:12:34.858,00:12:36.868,00:00:02.010,,math it's all right I just
190,3,1,00:12:38.608,00:12:39.280,00:00:00.672,yeah so,
191,3,1,00:12:39.550,00:12:41.690,00:00:02.140,,all right so now you add
192,3,1,00:12:44.385,00:12:45.465,00:00:01.080,,you add nine right
193,3,1,00:12:45.820,00:12:46.044,00:00:00.224,yeah,
194,3,1,00:12:46.320,00:12:46.890,00:00:00.570,,so
195,3,1,00:12:50.621,00:12:52.020,00:00:01.399,,so you add nine to this
196,3,1,00:12:53.155,00:12:58.830,00:00:05.675,,and then you're left with thirteen p equals fifty
197,3,1,00:13:02.140,00:13:02.743,00:00:00.603,,so
198,3,1,00:13:05.080,00:13:07.375,00:00:02.295,so then you want to give it to the thirteen,
199,3,1,00:13:08.105,00:13:09.790,00:00:01.685,,so you divide it by thirteen
200,3,1,00:13:13.020,00:13:15.360,00:00:02.340,,wait does the fraction umm
201,3,1,00:13:17.535,00:13:21.060,00:00:03.525,,does the fifty divided by thirteen equal out to a fraction
202,3,1,00:13:21.870,00:13:25.067,00:00:03.197,no I don't think it's simplified I think it's just fifty over thirteen,
203,3,1,00:13:25.320,00:13:26.000,00:00:00.680,,all right great
204,3,1,00:13:29.341,00:13:32.250,00:00:02.909,,I thought that it could've been a simplified fraction I was not sure
205,3,1,00:13:32.520,00:13:37.260,00:00:04.740,I mean like thirteen is like prime numbers so it would not be that likely,
206,3,1,00:13:37.626,00:13:38.000,00:00:00.374,,yeah
207,3,1,00:13:38.850,00:13:43.379,00:00:04.529,,so with this one it's a little bit different but you just subtract ten
208,3,1,00:13:44.800,00:13:45.700,00:00:00.900,,from both sides
209,3,1,00:13:47.030,00:13:47.160,00:00:00.130,yup,
210,3,1,00:13:47.890,00:13:48.460,00:00:00.570,,so
211,3,1,00:13:49.392,00:13:50.312,00:00:00.920,,twenty four
212,3,1,00:13:52.810,00:13:53.731,00:00:00.921,,and umm
213,3,1,00:13:55.136,00:13:56.996,00:00:01.860,,so you are left with six x
214,3,1,00:13:57.460,00:13:58.120,00:00:00.660,,equals
215,3,1,00:13:58.790,00:14:00.805,00:00:02.015,,twenty-four so then you divide by
216,3,1,00:14:01.330,00:14:05.152,00:00:03.822,,sorry I'm getting over a cold so that's why I sound
217,3,1,00:14:05.800,00:14:06.260,00:00:00.460,yeah a six,
218,3,1,00:14:08.045,00:14:12.540,00:00:04.495,,divided by six and then x equals four because twenty-four divided by six equals four
219,3,1,00:14:14.440,00:14:15.631,00:00:01.191,oh your equals signs are getting better,
220,3,1,00:14:16.571,00:14:17.440,00:00:00.869,,yeah
221,3,1,00:14:18.876,00:14:20.490,00:00:01.614,okay next one,
222,3,1,00:14:21.570,00:14:22.570,00:00:01.000,,all right so
223,3,1,00:14:25.500,00:14:26.430,00:00:00.930,,with this one
224,3,1,00:14:27.350,00:14:29.768,00:00:02.418,,since that's a negative you add it right so
225,3,1,00:14:30.384,00:14:30.754,00:00:00.370,yeah,
226,3,1,00:14:40.100,00:14:40.460,00:00:00.360,,oh okay
227,3,1,00:14:43.420,00:14:44.340,00:00:00.920,,oh my gosh
228,3,1,00:14:46.960,00:14:47.340,00:00:00.380,,so
229,3,1,00:14:48.550,00:14:49.360,00:00:00.810,,that would equal
230,3,1,00:14:52.860,00:14:54.120,00:00:01.260,,sixty-two
231,3,1,00:14:54.550,00:14:55.260,00:00:00.710,,equals
232,3,1,00:14:55.740,00:14:56.580,00:00:00.840,,fifteen
233,3,1,00:14:57.300,00:14:58.845,00:00:01.545,,k oh my god
234,3,1,00:14:59.410,00:14:59.900,00:00:00.490,,umm
235,3,1,00:15:00.590,00:15:01.120,00:00:00.530,,and then
236,3,1,00:15:01.950,00:15:03.600,00:00:01.650,,divide that by fifteen
237,3,1,00:15:06.700,00:15:08.110,00:00:01.410,,so that would just be another
238,3,1,00:15:08.743,00:15:11.946,00:00:03.203,let's see where were we sixty-two divisible by three nope,
239,3,1,00:15:14.249,00:15:16.950,00:00:02.701,I'd say that no you can't simplify it,
240,3,1,00:15:17.314,00:15:18.320,00:00:01.006,it maybe maybe not,
241,3,1,00:15:24.350,00:15:25.910,00:00:01.560,yeah because yeah,
242,3,1,00:15:26.008,00:15:26.458,00:00:00.450,,all right
243,3,1,00:15:28.250,00:15:28.780,00:00:00.530,,so
244,3,1,00:15:30.860,00:15:31.861,00:00:01.001,,for this one
245,3,1,00:15:34.920,00:15:35.270,00:00:00.350,,subtract
246,3,1,00:15:35.350,00:15:35.710,00:00:00.360,yeah,
247,3,1,00:15:36.635,00:15:37.055,00:00:00.420,twelve,
248,3,1,00:15:47.142,00:15:50.560,00:00:03.418,,sorry it's like it takes a minute for it to show up
249,3,1,00:15:51.560,00:15:53.200,00:00:01.640,yeah real slow,
250,3,1,00:15:54.155,00:15:54.595,00:00:00.440,okay,
251,3,1,00:16:07.080,00:16:08.560,00:00:01.480,so yeah twenty one,
252,3,1,00:16:08.860,00:16:09.130,00:00:00.270,that's right,
253,3,1,00:16:10.380,00:16:12.859,00:00:02.479,,so then that cancels out obviously
254,3,1,00:16:13.119,00:16:13.519,00:00:00.400,yeah,
255,3,1,00:16:13.944,00:16:14.734,00:00:00.790,,so plus
256,3,1,00:16:16.390,00:16:18.224,00:00:01.834,,oh no that equals twenty one
257,3,1,00:16:19.454,00:16:20.487,00:00:01.033,,equals seven x
258,3,1,00:16:21.217,00:16:21.707,00:00:00.490,,and then
259,3,1,00:16:22.080,00:16:23.940,00:00:01.860,,twenty-one is divisible by seven so
260,3,1,00:16:24.745,00:16:25.115,00:00:00.370,yeah,
261,3,1,00:16:25.700,00:16:28.952,00:00:03.252,,so that's umm divisible by three so then umm
262,3,1,00:16:29.670,00:16:31.189,00:00:01.519,,x equals three
263,3,1,00:16:32.569,00:16:33.389,00:00:00.820,yup okay,
264,3,1,00:16:36.950,00:16:39.820,00:00:02.870,,all right great oh so this is a different one
265,3,1,00:16:40.540,00:16:45.540,00:00:05.000,,so first you're going to get to pause filler you're going to do the variables first
266,3,1,00:16:46.310,00:16:48.860,00:00:02.550,,and then you do the one that's like less right
267,3,1,00:16:49.068,00:16:52.670,00:00:03.602,yeah you do the less because otherwise you'll have the negative p and that's not that fun,
268,3,1,00:16:52.900,00:16:53.220,00:00:00.320,,yeah
269,3,1,00:16:53.818,00:16:56.670,00:00:02.852,,so minus p and then minus p
270,3,1,00:16:57.384,00:17:00.040,00:00:02.656,,so you end up with fifteen equals
271,3,1,00:17:00.460,00:17:00.910,00:00:00.450,,oh gosh
272,3,1,00:17:01.790,00:17:02.160,00:00:00.370,,got it
273,3,1,00:17:05.060,00:17:08.180,00:00:03.120,,umm fifteen sorry umm fifteen equals two p
274,3,1,00:17:09.170,00:17:10.040,00:00:00.870,,plus twelve
275,3,1,00:17:12.177,00:17:12.296,00:00:00.119,yeah,
276,3,1,00:17:12.475,00:17:13.400,00:00:00.925,,so then umm
277,3,1,00:17:13.732,00:17:14.790,00:00:01.058,it's just like the other problems,
278,3,1,00:17:14.925,00:17:16.510,00:00:01.585,,yeah now you subtract twelve
279,3,1,00:17:18.560,00:17:19.060,00:00:00.500,,so
280,3,1,00:17:19.640,00:17:20.710,00:00:01.070,,three equals
281,3,1,00:17:21.250,00:17:21.700,00:00:00.450,,oh god
282,3,1,00:17:23.410,00:17:23.820,00:00:00.410,,two
283,3,1,00:17:24.500,00:17:24.870,00:00:00.370,,p
284,3,1,00:17:26.330,00:17:26.940,00:00:00.610,,no
285,3,1,00:17:27.940,00:17:31.980,00:00:04.040,,no you divide it by two so you end up with three halves
286,3,1,00:17:34.160,00:17:36.670,00:00:02.510,yeah so because you can't simplify that anymore,
287,3,1,00:17:36.710,00:17:37.090,00:00:00.380,,yeah
288,3,1,00:17:45.150,00:17:45.730,00:00:00.580,,all right
289,3,1,00:17:46.259,00:17:46.720,00:00:00.461,okay so for this one,
290,3,1,00:17:46.720,00:17:48.190,00:00:01.470,so for this one,
291,3,1,00:17:48.810,00:17:52.140,00:00:03.330,yeah you want to start off by having only one k,
292,3,1,00:17:55.210,00:17:55.700,00:00:00.490,,so
293,3,1,00:17:56.640,00:17:59.190,00:00:02.550,,you have to subtract that anyway
294,3,1,00:18:00.010,00:18:00.770,00:00:00.760,,subtract
295,3,1,00:18:02.832,00:18:07.142,00:00:04.310,,that from this so you would end up with negative ten because you leave the negative there
296,3,1,00:18:07.409,00:18:08.087,00:00:00.678,yeah,
297,3,1,00:18:07.420,00:18:08.090,00:00:00.670,,equals
298,3,1,00:18:09.180,00:18:10.670,00:00:01.490,,seven k
299,3,1,00:18:13.450,00:18:14.960,00:00:01.510,,minus sixty-eight
300,3,1,00:18:16.840,00:18:17.260,00:00:00.420,,then
301,3,1,00:18:17.837,00:18:21.400,00:00:03.563,,then plus ten on both sides
302,3,1,00:18:21.400,00:18:21.800,00:00:00.400,,plus
303,3,1,00:18:22.920,00:18:24.460,00:00:01.540,,ten on both sides
304,3,1,00:18:25.230,00:18:31.243,00:00:06.013,umm no actually you wouldn't want to do the plus ten because then you'll have seven k equals yeah so,
305,3,1,00:18:31.630,00:18:32.250,00:00:00.620,,you add sixty-eight
306,3,1,00:18:32.630,00:18:32.750,00:00:00.120,yup,
307,3,1,00:18:33.790,00:18:35.800,00:00:02.010,,I'm just going to write over it you know what
308,3,1,00:18:37.910,00:18:39.180,00:00:01.270,,so plus sixty-eight
309,3,1,00:18:39.860,00:18:40.920,00:00:01.060,,so that cancels out
310,3,1,00:18:41.550,00:18:41.940,00:00:00.390,,then
311,3,1,00:18:44.710,00:18:45.600,00:00:00.890,,seventy-eight
312,3,1,00:18:48.630,00:18:49.330,00:00:00.700,,equals
313,3,1,00:18:49.655,00:18:51.650,00:00:01.995,,equals seven k
314,3,1,00:18:51.650,00:18:52.320,00:00:00.670,,seven
315,3,1,00:18:52.920,00:18:55.103,00:00:02.183,,k wait is seventy-eight divided by seven
316,3,1,00:18:55.623,00:18:56.893,00:00:01.270,,divisible by seven I mean
317,3,1,00:18:57.023,00:19:05.700,00:00:08.677,wait no I think you messed up because that's a negative ten so it wouldn't be ten plus sixty it would be ten minus it would be sixty-eight minus ten,
318,3,1,00:19:06.000,00:19:06.865,00:00:00.865,,oh
319,3,1,00:19:06.910,00:19:07.300,00:00:00.390,yeah,
320,3,1,00:19:07.890,00:19:08.340,00:00:00.450,so,
321,3,1,00:19:08.440,00:19:09.440,00:00:01.000,,it would be fifty-eight
322,3,1,00:19:11.370,00:19:17.700,00:00:06.330,,so fifty-eight equals seven k so is fifty-eight divisible by a seven I can't talk I'm sorry umm
323,3,1,00:19:18.080,00:19:18.760,00:00:00.680,umm,
324,3,1,00:19:19.350,00:19:22.380,00:00:03.030,I don't think though because I don't remember that fifty six is,
325,3,1,00:19:23.060,00:19:24.030,00:00:00.970,fifty-eight isn't,
326,3,1,00:19:24.410,00:19:25.020,00:00:00.610,,okay great
327,3,1,00:19:26.190,00:19:26.770,00:00:00.580,so,
328,3,1,00:19:27.730,00:19:29.300,00:00:01.570,you can just here we go,
329,3,1,00:19:30.320,00:19:31.640,00:00:01.320,,so k equals
330,3,1,00:19:32.420,00:19:33.100,00:00:00.680,,fifty eight
331,3,1,00:19:34.010,00:19:34.300,00:00:00.290,yeah,
332,3,1,00:19:38.280,00:19:39.242,00:00:00.962,,all right next stop
333,3,1,00:19:41.490,00:19:43.690,00:00:02.200,umm okay to solve this problem,
334,3,1,00:19:44.060,00:19:45.950,00:00:01.890,you have to delete all the variables,
335,3,1,00:19:49.430,00:19:51.630,00:00:02.200,,wait so it said come out and get us
336,3,1,00:19:51.980,00:19:52.230,00:00:00.250,yeah,
337,3,1,00:19:52.620,00:19:53.680,00:00:01.060,umm do you know where they are,
338,3,1,00:19:55.140,00:19:55.590,00:00:00.450,,umm
339,3,1,00:19:57.340,00:19:57.670,00:00:00.330,,I
340,3,1,00:19:58.110,00:19:58.560,00:00:00.450,,don't
341,3,1,00:19:59.020,00:19:59.300,00:00:00.280,,but
342,3,1,00:19:59.770,00:20:00.040,00:00:00.270,okay,
343,3,1,00:20:00.930,00:20:02.140,00:00:01.210,maybe they're outside,
344,3,1,00:20:02.310,00:20:03.120,00:00:00.810,I'll go looking,
345,3,1,00:20:03.310,00:20:04.100,00:00:00.790,you look and I look,
346,3,1,00:20:04.410,00:20:05.050,00:00:00.640,,all right I'll be right back
347,3,1,00:20:37.490,00:20:37.940,00:00:00.450,,all right great
348,3,1,00:20:38.770,00:20:39.960,00:00:01.190,,so she still tutoring me
349,3,1,00:20:41.360,00:20:41.810,00:00:00.450,okay,
350,3,1,00:20:43.260,00:20:44.260,00:00:01.000,yeah okay,
351,3,1,00:20:45.390,00:20:46.450,00:00:01.060,so yeah,
352,3,1,00:20:46.850,00:20:50.080,00:00:03.230,you want to make sure one side has variables and one side doesn't,
353,3,1,00:20:50.960,00:20:51.280,00:00:00.320,,all right
354,3,1,00:20:51.430,00:20:51.540,00:00:00.110,,so
355,3,1,00:20:51.560,00:20:52.710,00:00:01.150,which one do you want to start with,
356,3,1,00:20:53.420,00:20:53.850,00:00:00.430,,umm
357,3,1,00:20:54.940,00:20:57.531,00:00:02.591,,let's just start with the variables so you subtract
358,3,1,00:20:58.660,00:21:00.360,00:00:01.700,,you subtract r
359,3,1,00:21:01.000,00:21:05.490,00:00:04.490,,so then you would just end up with r  because you don't say one r because it's all yeah
360,3,1,00:21:05.820,00:21:06.050,00:00:00.230,yeah,
361,3,1,00:21:06.300,00:21:08.350,00:00:02.050,,so you keep the negative thirty-three
362,3,1,00:21:09.570,00:21:10.396,00:00:00.826,,equals
363,3,1,00:21:13.970,00:21:16.270,00:00:02.300,,r minus fifteen
364,3,1,00:21:18.710,00:21:19.260,00:00:00.550,,and then
365,3,1,00:21:20.670,00:21:21.231,00:00:00.561,,you
366,3,1,00:21:22.127,00:21:24.517,00:00:02.390,,add fifteen to both sides right
367,3,1,00:21:26.120,00:21:26.293,00:00:00.173,yup,
368,3,1,00:21:30.940,00:21:31.440,00:00:00.500,,so
369,3,1,00:21:34.380,00:21:35.660,00:00:01.280,so then you just want,
370,3,1,00:21:38.080,00:21:41.490,00:00:03.410,,so negative three plus negative thirty-three plus fifteen
371,3,1,00:21:42.470,00:21:43.020,00:00:00.550,is,
372,3,1,00:21:44.740,00:21:46.846,00:00:02.106,pause filler that's a negative three just want to,
373,3,1,00:21:54.770,00:21:57.600,00:00:02.830,that would be a negative twelve I'm pretty sure,
374,3,1,00:22:03.790,00:22:07.040,00:00:03.250,,oh wait don't you always want to end up with a variable on the left side
375,3,1,00:22:07.960,00:22:08.620,00:00:00.660,umm,
376,3,1,00:22:09.170,00:22:12.502,00:00:03.332,pause filler I'm pretty sure that doesn't matter but yeah if you want to write that around,
377,3,1,00:22:13.520,00:22:13.930,00:00:00.410,,all right
378,3,1,00:22:14.110,00:22:14.500,00:00:00.390,okay,
379,3,1,00:22:16.303,00:22:19.820,00:00:03.517,,negative forty-two plus u equals eight plus four u
380,3,1,00:22:21.366,00:22:21.886,00:00:00.520,so,
381,3,1,00:22:22.352,00:22:23.843,00:00:01.491,want to get for the variable again,
382,3,1,00:22:24.633,00:22:26.463,00:00:01.830,,yeah you subtract u
383,3,1,00:22:26.818,00:22:29.409,00:00:02.591,,from both sides so you'd end up with negative forty-two
384,3,1,00:22:31.178,00:22:32.018,00:00:00.840,,equals
385,3,1,00:22:32.568,00:22:32.898,00:00:00.330,,eight
386,3,1,00:22:36.240,00:22:36.790,00:00:00.550,,plus
387,3,1,00:22:37.990,00:22:39.240,00:00:01.250,,three u now
388,3,1,00:22:40.290,00:22:40.830,00:00:00.540,,so
389,3,1,00:22:41.400,00:22:42.060,00:00:00.660,now you want to,
390,3,1,00:22:42.440,00:22:43.408,00:00:00.968,get rid of that eight,
391,3,1,00:22:45.249,00:22:46.990,00:00:01.741,oh that's fun underlining stuff,
392,3,1,00:22:49.524,00:22:50.094,00:00:00.570,,so
393,3,1,00:22:50.820,00:22:52.730,00:00:01.910,,then you subtract eight from this
394,3,1,00:22:53.190,00:22:55.190,00:00:02.000,,so since it's a negative you would base
395,3,1,00:22:56.422,00:22:56.942,00:00:00.520,,yeah you
396,3,1,00:22:58.097,00:22:58.947,00:00:00.850,,I'm just thinking of
397,3,1,00:23:00.000,00:23:01.900,00:00:01.900,yes so it would still be a negative,
398,3,1,00:23:02.170,00:23:02.600,00:00:00.430,,oh
399,3,1,00:23:03.410,00:23:07.350,00:00:03.940,,oh so yeah it would still be a negative so you're basically just adding it but it's a negative
400,3,1,00:23:08.025,00:23:08.205,00:00:00.180,yeah,
401,3,1,00:23:08.240,00:23:08.710,00:00:00.470,,kind of
402,3,1,00:23:08.940,00:23:09.630,00:00:00.690,yeah,
403,3,1,00:23:10.310,00:23:10.720,00:00:00.410,,so
404,3,1,00:23:11.160,00:23:13.810,00:00:02.650,,you would obviously end up with negative fifty
405,3,1,00:23:14.090,00:23:14.360,00:00:00.270,yeah,
406,3,1,00:23:14.740,00:23:16.760,00:00:02.020,,equals three u
407,3,1,00:23:17.225,00:23:17.685,00:00:00.460,,and then
408,3,1,00:23:18.150,00:23:20.300,00:00:02.150,,and then fifty isn't divisible by three
409,3,1,00:23:20.670,00:23:21.140,00:00:00.470,no,
410,3,1,00:23:21.350,00:23:23.912,00:00:02.562,,so just divide it by three
411,3,1,00:23:24.520,00:23:26.370,00:00:01.850,,and then u equals
412,3,1,00:23:27.640,00:23:28.770,00:00:01.130,,oh fifty
413,3,1,00:23:29.127,00:23:29.927,00:00:00.800,,over three
414,3,1,00:23:35.440,00:23:35.930,00:00:00.490,,all right
415,3,1,00:23:37.430,00:23:38.170,00:00:00.740,,so
416,3,1,00:23:40.830,00:23:41.840,00:00:01.010,I'll pick numbers,
417,3,1,00:23:42.090,00:23:42.560,00:00:00.470,nineteen,
418,3,1,00:23:43.120,00:23:43.750,00:00:00.630,okay,
419,3,1,00:23:44.150,00:23:48.260,00:00:04.110,,so you're just going to add no subtract n
420,3,1,00:23:48.640,00:23:50.060,00:00:01.420,,just forget I put that sign there
421,3,1,00:23:50.548,00:23:50.968,00:00:00.420,,umm
422,3,1,00:23:52.230,00:23:53.775,00:00:01.545,,subtract n from both sides
423,3,1,00:23:54.605,00:23:55.115,00:00:00.510,,so
424,3,1,00:23:56.060,00:23:57.345,00:00:01.285,,so what you end up with one of six equals
425,3,1,00:23:57.790,00:23:58.770,00:00:00.980,,one o six
426,3,1,00:24:00.270,00:24:01.050,00:00:00.780,,equals
427,3,1,00:24:02.660,00:24:04.190,00:00:01.530,,ninety nine n
428,3,1,00:24:05.740,00:24:06.290,00:00:00.550,,plus
429,3,1,00:24:06.625,00:24:07.335,00:00:00.710,,seven
430,3,1,00:24:08.660,00:24:09.260,00:00:00.600,,so then
431,3,1,00:24:10.880,00:24:11.340,00:00:00.460,,you
432,3,1,00:24:12.280,00:24:13.820,00:00:01.540,,do you subtract seven next
433,3,1,00:24:14.780,00:24:16.829,00:00:02.049,umm yeah you want to subtract the seven,
434,3,1,00:24:17.279,00:24:17.799,00:00:00.520,,so
435,3,1,00:24:18.230,00:24:22.490,00:00:04.260,,so you that you end up with ninety-nine on this side also so ninety-nine equals
436,3,1,00:24:22.100,00:24:22.830,00:00:00.730,that would be easy,
437,3,1,00:24:23.120,00:24:27.540,00:00:04.420,,ninety-nine and then obviously that divides into one so
438,3,1,00:24:28.475,00:24:29.890,00:00:01.415,,n equals one
439,3,1,00:24:30.297,00:24:31.780,00:00:01.483,,that was an easy problem
440,3,1,00:24:32.040,00:24:33.900,00:00:01.860,yeah that easy too six numbers,
441,3,1,00:24:34.645,00:24:35.095,00:00:00.450,,all right
442,3,1,00:24:36.330,00:24:37.000,00:00:00.670,,so
443,3,1,00:24:39.020,00:24:39.510,00:00:00.490,yeah,
444,3,1,00:24:39.720,00:24:40.150,00:00:00.430,,fifty five
445,3,1,00:24:40.610,00:24:41.750,00:00:01.140,,all right great so
446,3,1,00:24:42.230,00:24:44.970,00:00:02.740,,so you subtract g this time because it's
447,3,1,00:24:45.495,00:24:45.815,00:00:00.320,yeah,
448,3,1,00:24:47.140,00:24:48.350,00:00:01.210,so that will lessen,
449,3,1,00:24:49.740,00:24:51.130,00:00:01.390,oh I want to try with g,
450,3,1,00:24:52.235,00:24:53.030,00:00:00.795,there we go,
451,3,1,00:24:56.710,00:24:57.670,00:00:00.960,,fifty-five
452,3,1,00:25:00.012,00:25:02.750,00:00:02.738,,I can't even write on this wait I'm just going to go back
453,3,1,00:25:05.553,00:25:06.440,00:00:00.887,you want with the,
454,3,1,00:25:07.117,00:25:08.360,00:00:01.243,,all right so fifty five
455,3,1,00:25:10.123,00:25:10.690,00:00:00.567,,minus
456,3,1,00:25:15.421,00:25:18.700,00:00:03.279,,no like I'm sorry fifty-five equals seven plus twelve g
457,3,1,00:25:19.320,00:25:19.790,00:00:00.470,,seven
458,3,1,00:25:20.910,00:25:22.550,00:00:01.640,,plus twelve g
459,3,1,00:25:22.970,00:25:23.130,00:00:00.160,yup,
460,3,1,00:25:24.830,00:25:25.480,00:00:00.650,,so then
461,3,1,00:25:27.740,00:25:28.210,00:00:00.470,,plus
462,3,1,00:25:30.150,00:25:31.660,00:00:01.510,,no it's minus seven right
463,3,1,00:25:31.940,00:25:33.600,00:00:01.660,yeah you want as good as positive,
464,3,1,00:25:34.300,00:25:35.290,00:00:00.990,,so minus seven
465,3,1,00:25:36.240,00:25:37.668,00:00:01.428,,and then that would
466,3,1,00:25:38.520,00:25:39.580,00:00:01.060,,end up being
467,3,1,00:25:40.670,00:25:42.370,00:00:01.700,,fourty eight yeah fourty eight
468,3,1,00:25:42.610,00:25:43.210,00:00:00.600,yeah fourty eight,
469,3,1,00:25:43.260,00:25:46.090,00:00:02.830,I don't know of the two k oh yeah because I want to subtract the two,
470,3,1,00:25:48.740,00:25:49.330,00:00:00.590,,so
471,3,1,00:25:49.920,00:25:50.470,00:00:00.550,,so fourty eight is
472,3,1,00:25:51.600,00:25:53.250,00:00:01.650,,umm that's twelve times
473,3,1,00:25:53.883,00:25:54.443,00:00:00.560,,four right
474,3,1,00:25:56.030,00:25:58.920,00:00:02.890,umm yeah that's what so you'd want to divide the twelve,
475,3,1,00:25:59.260,00:26:01.260,00:00:02.000,,so g equals
476,3,1,00:26:01.780,00:26:02.100,00:00:00.320,,four
477,3,1,00:26:02.830,00:26:03.040,00:00:00.210,,great
478,3,1,00:26:06.080,00:26:06.472,00:00:00.392,okay,
479,3,1,00:26:13.871,00:26:16.973,00:00:03.102,,all right so you would want to start out by subtracting the n
480,3,1,00:26:18.030,00:26:18.620,00:00:00.590,,and then
481,3,1,00:26:19.100,00:26:20.460,00:00:01.360,,doing that on both sides and
482,3,1,00:26:20.965,00:26:21.695,00:00:00.730,,and
483,3,1,00:26:28.520,00:26:28.670,00:00:00.150,,huh
484,3,1,00:26:29.503,00:26:30.260,00:00:00.757,,oh it's going great
485,3,1,00:26:33.109,00:26:33.510,00:00:00.401,,okay great
486,3,1,00:26:35.558,00:26:36.148,00:00:00.590,,oh sorry
487,3,1,00:26:58.912,00:26:59.280,00:00:00.368,okay,
488,3,1,00:27:21.580,00:27:22.220,00:00:00.640,this is weird,
489,3,1,00:27:22.945,00:27:23.255,00:00:00.310,,yeah
490,3,1,00:27:23.410,00:27:23.780,00:00:00.370,this is so weird,
491,3,1,00:27:24.050,00:27:25.410,00:00:01.360,it's like you're holding hands,
492,3,1,00:27:26.120,00:27:27.210,00:00:01.090,,these are confusing me
493,3,1,00:27:28.380,00:27:28.950,00:00:00.570,the smell,
494,3,1,00:27:30.540,00:27:31.110,00:00:00.570,,they are supposed to
495,3,1,00:27:31.450,00:27:32.940,00:00:01.490,,they're supposed to be sweet and sour
496,3,1,00:27:54.730,00:27:55.890,00:00:01.160,that is weird,
497,3,1,00:27:56.340,00:27:56.690,00:00:00.350,,yeah

631,3,1,00:36:27.333,00:36:28.493,00:00:01.160,that was a thirteen,
632,3,1,00:36:30.492,00:36:30.945,00:00:00.453,x,
633,3,1,00:36:31.746,00:36:32.306,00:00:00.560,equals,
634,3,1,00:36:32.626,00:36:34.266,00:00:01.640,twenty five there we go,
635,3,1,00:36:38.600,00:36:39.533,00:00:00.933,,all right great
636,3,1,00:36:40.426,00:36:41.146,00:00:00.720,let me see,
637,3,1,00:36:41.760,00:36:46.733,00:00:04.973,you change it do you know how to change it or should I change it for you oh there is the page okay,
638,3,1,00:36:48.026,00:36:48.466,00:00:00.440,,so
639,3,1,00:36:49.079,00:36:51.427,00:00:02.348,,so this is a negative so we start off by adding
640,3,1,00:36:52.706,00:36:53.106,00:00:00.400,okay,
641,3,1,00:36:53.440,00:36:54.627,00:00:01.187,so adding y,
642,3,1,00:36:55.000,00:36:55.480,00:00:00.480,here we go,
643,3,1,00:36:56.133,00:36:56.907,00:00:00.774,wait no not the y,
644,3,1,00:36:56.973,00:36:57.960,00:00:00.987,,oh not the y
645,3,1,00:36:58.141,00:37:01.269,00:00:03.128,but you know I guess you could do that right yeah,
646,3,1,00:37:02.759,00:37:03.146,00:00:00.387,,no
647,3,1,00:37:04.613,00:37:07.773,00:00:03.160,,no no you shouldn't do that wait let's go back let's go back
648,3,1,00:37:08.374,00:37:09.107,00:00:00.733,,that was wrong
649,3,1,00:37:10.213,00:37:10.586,00:00:00.373,,okay
650,3,1,00:37:11.053,00:37:11.413,00:00:00.360,,so
651,3,1,00:37:11.667,00:37:15.319,00:00:03.652,,you want to start off by subtracting eighteen from both sides
652,3,1,00:37:16.059,00:37:16.393,00:00:00.334,okay,
653,3,1,00:37:21.280,00:37:24.093,00:00:02.813,okay negative y equals,
654,3,1,00:37:25.239,00:37:25.613,00:00:00.374,five,
655,3,1,00:37:26.346,00:37:31.346,00:00:05.000,,yeah great so just remember that umm there's a negative in front of it so that means that there's a negative one
656,3,1,00:37:31.987,00:37:34.760,00:00:02.773,,so divide that by negative one and
657,3,1,00:37:36.619,00:37:37.400,00:00:00.781,,you'll get your answer
658,3,1,00:37:38.869,00:37:41.335,00:00:02.466,okay y equals,
659,3,1,00:37:42.413,00:37:43.426,00:00:01.013,negative five,
660,3,1,00:37:43.960,00:37:44.320,00:00:00.360,,great
661,3,1,00:37:45.267,00:37:45.667,00:00:00.400,,all right
662,3,1,00:37:48.213,00:37:50.093,00:00:01.880,,this one is a little bit different umm
663,3,1,00:37:50.760,00:37:52.746,00:00:01.986,,so what do you think you're going to start off by doing
664,3,1,00:37:54.359,00:37:55.586,00:00:01.227,umm see for this one,
665,3,1,00:37:56.352,00:37:57.919,00:00:01.567,we want since there's umm,
666,3,1,00:38:00.146,00:38:00.479,00:00:00.333,I guess,
667,3,1,00:38:00.946,00:38:02.826,00:00:01.880,there's two ks so umm,
668,3,1,00:38:04.173,00:38:06.174,00:00:02.001,you would want to get rid of one of the k,
669,3,1,00:38:06.499,00:38:08.267,00:00:01.768,,yeah you should start off with the variable
670,3,1,00:38:09.306,00:38:10.813,00:00:01.507,so we're going to add,
671,3,1,00:38:11.175,00:38:14.034,00:00:02.859,a k so that it cancels out the other k,
672,3,1,00:38:19.106,00:38:19.600,00:00:00.494,are you okay,
673,3,1,00:38:19.973,00:38:21.090,00:00:01.117,,yeah I'm okay thank you
674,3,1,00:38:22.027,00:38:23.760,00:00:01.733,so we have negative fouteen,
675,3,1,00:38:24.522,00:38:24.882,00:00:00.360,equals,
676,3,1,00:38:25.253,00:38:25.973,00:00:00.720,thirty six,
677,3,1,00:38:26.773,00:38:27.053,00:00:00.280,plus,
678,3,1,00:38:27.493,00:38:27.933,00:00:00.440,two k,
679,3,1,00:38:29.573,00:38:31.533,00:00:01.960,,all right great so you end up with two k
680,3,1,00:38:32.067,00:38:32.587,00:00:00.520,,so
681,3,1,00:38:33.320,00:38:33.773,00:00:00.453,,now
682,3,1,00:38:35.733,00:38:36.839,00:00:01.106,,since umm
683,3,1,00:38:37.653,00:38:38.959,00:00:01.306,,this is a negative fourteen
684,3,1,00:38:39.386,00:38:39.986,00:00:00.600,,what do you
685,3,1,00:38:40.759,00:38:41.759,00:00:01.000,,what are you going to do now
686,3,1,00:38:42.520,00:38:43.293,00:00:00.773,I'm going to add,
687,3,1,00:38:43.640,00:38:44.360,00:00:00.720,so it will be,
688,3,1,00:38:46.507,00:38:49.520,00:00:03.013,,well you would be doing it to the thirty-six remember
689,3,1,00:38:50.053,00:38:51.746,00:00:01.693,,because that's alone on the other side
690,3,1,00:38:52.932,00:38:56.040,00:00:03.108,yeah but you also want to do it to both sides,
691,3,1,00:38:56.418,00:38:56.765,00:00:00.347,so,
692,3,1,00:38:57.733,00:38:58.280,00:00:00.547,I guess,
693,3,1,00:38:58.560,00:38:59.173,00:00:00.613,,I know but would you
694,3,1,00:38:59.213,00:39:01.386,00:00:02.173,oh yeah oh that oh oh,
695,3,1,00:39:01.453,00:39:03.306,00:00:01.853,,you would want to be subtracting thirty-six
696,3,1,00:39:08.573,00:39:10.773,00:00:02.200,I feel okay I did not see that,
697,3,1,00:39:11.693,00:39:13.714,00:00:02.021,,it's okay it was my fault
698,3,1,00:39:15.400,00:39:15.600,00:00:00.200,okay,
699,3,1,00:39:21.947,00:39:22.960,00:00:01.013,so hurry up umm,
700,3,1,00:39:24.040,00:39:27.478,00:00:03.438,so now you want to subtract with thirty-six,
701,3,1,00:39:31.918,00:39:33.597,00:00:01.679,yeah thirty-six,
702,3,1,00:39:34.253,00:39:36.519,00:00:02.266,ok and then you get umm,
703,3,1,00:39:36.626,00:39:38.960,00:00:02.334,negative fifty,
704,3,1,00:39:39.333,00:39:39.826,00:00:00.493,equals,
705,3,1,00:39:40.267,00:39:40.960,00:00:00.693,two k,
706,3,1,00:39:42.467,00:39:44.960,00:00:02.493,,all right so would want to divivde by two
707,3,1,00:39:45.320,00:39:45.640,00:00:00.320,yeah,
708,3,1,00:39:46.067,00:39:46.933,00:00:00.866,,on both sides
709,3,1,00:39:52.773,00:39:54.613,00:00:01.840,k equals negative twenty five,
710,3,1,00:39:56.013,00:39:56.653,00:00:00.640,and we're good,
711,3,1,00:39:57.280,00:39:57.453,00:00:00.173,,yup
712,3,1,00:39:59.240,00:39:59.653,00:00:00.413,,all right
713,3,1,00:40:00.279,00:40:00.826,00:00:00.547,,so
714,3,1,00:40:02.653,00:40:04.559,00:00:01.906,,umm for this one you
715,3,1,00:40:05.679,00:40:06.253,00:00:00.574,,can
716,3,1,00:40:06.559,00:40:07.173,00:00:00.614,,do
717,3,1,00:40:07.679,00:40:08.853,00:00:01.174,,you should do the
718,3,1,00:40:09.213,00:40:10.973,00:00:01.760,,variables first always but
719,3,1,00:40:11.479,00:40:14.346,00:00:02.867,,you should start off by adding b on this side because sorry I just wrote over that pause filler you should start off by adding b on this side
720,3,1,00:40:15.359,00:40:15.773,00:00:00.414,,because
721,3,1,00:40:16.066,00:40:17.253,00:00:01.187,,so I just wrote over there
722,3,1,00:40:17.679,00:40:18.065,00:00:00.386,,umm
723,3,1,00:40:18.386,00:40:19.960,00:00:01.574,,you should start off by adding b because
724,3,1,00:40:20.480,00:40:23.893,00:00:03.413,,even though they both look the same that umm
725,3,1,00:40:25.133,00:40:27.506,00:00:02.373,,is worth less and you should always
726,3,1,00:40:27.947,00:40:29.253,00:00:01.306,,add or subtract the worthly
727,3,1,00:40:30.479,00:40:39.173,00:00:08.694,okay so add b here and like the other following get seventeen thirteen plus two b,
728,3,1,00:40:40.665,00:40:41.652,00:00:00.987,and okay,
729,3,1,00:40:42.560,00:40:49.378,00:00:06.818,so now we need to make sure the b is on only one side and to do that you have to subtract the thirteen,
730,3,1,00:40:49.746,00:40:50.026,00:00:00.280,,right
731,3,1,00:40:50.880,00:40:51.773,00:00:00.893,not the seventeen,
732,3,1,00:40:53.146,00:40:54.106,00:00:00.960,and you get,
733,3,1,00:40:54.733,00:40:57.368,00:00:02.635,four equals two b,
734,3,1,00:40:57.910,00:40:59.750,00:00:01.840,and then you wnat to divide the two,
735,3,1,00:41:00.213,00:41:01.053,00:00:00.840,by two,
736,3,1,00:41:01.586,00:41:03.306,00:00:01.720,and you get two equals,
737,3,1,00:41:03.760,00:41:04.173,00:00:00.413,b,
738,3,1,00:41:04.573,00:41:06.213,00:00:01.640,and b equals two,
739,3,1,00:41:06.959,00:41:07.439,00:00:00.480,here we go,
740,3,1,00:41:08.520,00:41:08.946,00:00:00.426,,all right
741,3,1,00:41:09.480,00:41:09.920,00:00:00.440,,so
742,3,1,00:41:10.920,00:41:14.560,00:00:03.640,,this one is a little bit easier and you're multiplying so
743,3,1,00:41:15.213,00:41:17.720,00:00:02.507,,what are you going to do to solve the equation
744,3,1,00:41:18.333,00:41:24.869,00:00:06.536,so this one you want to measure g alone and since it's multiplying the negative nine by the g one you divide the negative nine,
745,3,1,00:41:24.973,00:41:25.333,00:00:00.360,,correct
746,3,1,00:41:25.933,00:41:26.199,00:00:00.266,that,
747,3,1,00:41:26.586,00:41:26.786,00:00:00.200,okay,
748,3,1,00:41:31.613,00:41:32.600,00:00:00.987,we get g,
749,3,1,00:41:33.120,00:41:33.933,00:00:00.813,equals,
750,3,1,00:41:34.880,00:41:36.546,00:00:01.666,negative nine there we go,
751,3,1,00:41:40.479,00:41:42.200,00:00:01.721,,all right great now next
752,3,1,00:41:43.079,00:41:46.346,00:00:03.267,,all right so for this one it's different than the last one
753,3,1,00:41:46.773,00:41:48.773,00:00:02.000,,and it's like what we have been doing
754,3,1,00:41:49.226,00:41:50.213,00:00:00.987,,but umm
755,3,1,00:41:51.419,00:41:53.559,00:00:02.140,,you would be subtracting ten to start off
756,3,1,00:41:54.189,00:41:54.375,00:00:00.186,okay,
757,3,1,00:42:02.799,00:42:04.679,00:00:01.880,I see so that seventy two,
758,3,1,00:42:10.600,00:42:10.827,00:00:00.227,okay,
759,3,1,00:42:11.840,00:42:14.320,00:00:02.480,okay so now you want to get rid of the eight right,
760,3,1,00:42:14.973,00:42:16.679,00:00:01.706,,yes so you would have to
761,3,1,00:42:17.653,00:42:20.026,00:00:02.373,,umm divide by negative eight in both sides
762,3,1,00:42:20.426,00:42:22.666,00:00:02.240,,and let me know if you need help on that
763,3,1,00:42:24.800,00:42:26.320,00:00:01.520,seventy two by eight,
764,3,1,00:42:28.093,00:42:28.973,00:00:00.880,that's nine,
765,3,1,00:42:29.093,00:42:29.440,00:00:00.347,,yeah
766,3,1,00:42:29.960,00:42:32.013,00:00:02.053,,well you remember it would be negative nine
767,3,1,00:42:33.000,00:42:33.093,00:00:00.093,yeah,
768,3,1,00:42:34.106,00:42:34.733,00:00:00.627,so there we go,
769,3,1,00:42:35.186,00:42:35.453,00:00:00.267,,great
770,3,1,00:42:35.799,00:42:36.906,00:00:01.107,,all right next page
771,3,1,00:42:37.386,00:42:40.547,00:00:03.161,,one hundred seventy equals sixty-five minus fourteen x
772,3,1,00:42:42.293,00:42:43.159,00:00:00.866,okay so,
773,3,1,00:42:43.919,00:42:45.026,00:00:01.107,for this one,
774,3,1,00:42:45.546,00:42:46.880,00:00:01.334,you want to,
775,3,1,00:42:47.200,00:42:48.613,00:00:01.413,subtract the sixty five,
776,3,1,00:42:57.786,00:42:58.800,00:00:01.014,there we go,
777,3,1,00:42:59.133,00:42:59.227,00:00:00.094,nope,
778,3,1,00:43:04.346,00:43:04.800,00:00:00.454,,so you
779,3,1,00:43:06.046,00:43:07.766,00:00:01.720,,jut to amke sure yiu know that like
780,3,1,00:43:09.067,00:43:12.373,00:00:03.306,,you seem to be you seem to know but I mean umm
781,3,1,00:43:12.733,00:43:13.266,00:00:00.533,,just to
782,3,1,00:43:13.519,00:43:14.666,00:00:01.147,,role is always like
783,3,1,00:43:15.067,00:43:19.853,00:00:04.786,,depending on whether it's positive or negative just add or subtract and everything
784,3,1,00:43:20.426,00:43:22.093,00:00:01.667,yeah okay so umm,
785,3,1,00:43:23.373,00:43:24.679,00:00:01.306,now we got to subtract,
786,3,1,00:43:25.347,00:43:28.307,00:00:02.960,okay one hundred seven sixty-five minus two,
787,3,1,00:43:31.773,00:43:33.010,00:00:01.237,I'm going to say that's forty-two,
788,3,1,00:43:34.867,00:43:35.400,00:00:00.533,so,
789,3,1,00:43:35.640,00:43:36.587,00:00:00.947,fourty two,
790,3,1,00:43:37.627,00:43:38.387,00:00:00.760,equals,
791,3,1,00:43:38.733,00:43:39.373,00:00:00.640,negative,
792,3,1,00:43:39.880,00:43:40.640,00:00:00.760,fourteen,
793,3,1,00:43:41.827,00:43:42.240,00:00:00.413,x,
794,3,1,00:43:44.786,00:43:45.760,00:00:00.974,,yeah
795,3,1,00:43:45.813,00:43:46.173,00:00:00.360,okay so,
796,3,1,00:43:47.627,00:43:49.560,00:00:01.933,now we want to umm,
797,3,1,00:43:50.666,00:43:52.040,00:00:01.374,divide by negative fourteen,
798,3,1,00:43:54.653,00:43:55.746,00:00:01.093,not the x ,
799,3,1,00:43:57.027,00:44:00.720,00:00:03.693,,so umm is ninety-two divided by negative
800,3,1,00:44:01.253,00:44:06.003,00:00:04.750,,I can't talk is ninety-two divided by divisible by negative fourteen
801,3,1,00:44:06.813,00:44:09.917,00:00:03.104,actually maybe let's see wait fourteen times three happens to,
802,3,1,00:44:11.946,00:44:12.146,00:00:00.200,yeah,
803,3,1,00:44:12.813,00:44:14.719,00:00:01.906,so we have umm,
804,3,1,00:44:16.867,00:44:17.080,00:00:00.213,x,
805,3,1,00:44:18.200,00:44:18.680,00:00:00.480,equals,
806,3,1,00:44:19.026,00:44:19.959,00:00:00.933,negative three,
807,3,1,00:44:20.320,00:44:20.680,00:00:00.360,,great
808,3,1,00:44:22.027,00:44:22.467,00:00:00.440,,all right
809,3,1,00:44:23.839,00:44:25.800,00:00:01.961,,onto the next problem you're moving fast
810,3,1,00:44:26.625,00:44:26.999,00:00:00.374,,all right
811,3,1,00:44:27.587,00:44:27.973,00:00:00.386,,so
812,3,1,00:44:28.373,00:44:28.760,00:00:00.387,,umm
813,3,1,00:44:28.982,00:44:31.187,00:00:02.205,,this has bigger numbers in it but
814,3,1,00:44:31.799,00:44:34.587,00:00:02.788,,you would start off by adding what number
815,3,1,00:44:35.560,00:44:36.146,00:00:00.586,forty one,
816,3,1,00:44:36.347,00:44:36.533,00:00:00.186,,yup
817,3,1,00:44:43.786,00:44:44.706,00:00:00.920,that looks like an h,
818,3,1,00:44:46.413,00:44:47.159,00:00:00.746,yeah that was horrible,
819,3,1,00:44:48.826,00:44:53.134,00:00:04.308,umm yes so that would be seventy-five equals negative nine k,
820,3,1,00:44:55.666,00:44:57.253,00:00:01.587,divided by negative nine,
821,3,1,00:44:58.186,00:45:00.360,00:00:02.174,,so you just want to make that equal on both sides
822,3,1,00:45:01.866,00:45:02.306,00:00:00.440,so,
823,3,1,00:45:06.799,00:45:08.653,00:00:01.854,would you say seventy five,
824,3,1,00:45:09.733,00:45:11.600,00:00:01.867,divivded by negative nine,
825,3,1,00:45:12.586,00:45:13.253,00:00:00.667,there we go,
826,3,1,00:45:14.400,00:45:15.093,00:00:00.693,,all right great
827,3,1,00:45:16.000,00:45:16.600,00:00:00.600,,so
828,3,1,00:45:17.400,00:45:18.839,00:00:01.439,,so now this one is a lot different
829,3,1,00:45:19.707,00:45:26.267,00:00:06.560,,so umm you would have to start off by adding p to both sides so what would you add it to on the other side
830,3,1,00:45:26.950,00:45:31.865,00:00:04.915,so I guess you want to so that would be nine p so you want to add the p yeah,
831,3,1,00:45:32.653,00:45:36.307,00:00:03.654,so if you do it to both sides we got the negative fifty-two here,
832,3,1,00:45:36.893,00:45:40.519,00:00:03.626,we got the nine p over here we got the negative sixteen,
833,3,1,00:45:41.346,00:45:43.080,00:00:01.734,which we need to now add,
834,3,1,00:45:43.347,00:45:43.893,00:00:00.546,add,
835,3,1,00:45:44.053,00:45:44.453,00:00:00.400,,yeah
836,3,1,00:45:45.253,00:45:48.520,00:00:03.267,,yeah just remember that you always have to keep that negative there because that's important
837,3,1,00:45:51.626,00:45:54.680,00:00:03.054,so it would be fifty two minus sixteen,
838,3,1,00:45:55.613,00:46:00.856,00:00:05.243,which happens to be fourteen that would be,
839,3,1,00:46:01.667,00:46:01.907,00:00:00.240,forty,
840,3,1,00:46:02.506,00:46:04.120,00:00:01.614,I'm pretty sure that would be thirty-six,
841,3,1,00:46:04.440,00:46:04.733,00:00:00.293,,yeah
842,3,1,00:46:05.093,00:46:06.533,00:00:01.440,that seems like an interesting one,
843,3,1,00:46:06.686,00:46:07.046,00:00:00.360,okay,
844,3,1,00:46:07.519,00:46:08.306,00:00:00.787,thirty six,
845,3,1,00:46:08.840,00:46:10.680,00:00:01.840,equals nine p,
846,3,1,00:46:13.933,00:46:14.213,00:00:00.280,okay,
847,3,1,00:46:14.626,00:46:17.103,00:00:02.477,pause filler okay so then we want to divide it by nine,
848,3,1,00:46:19.079,00:46:20.333,00:00:01.254,and we get,
849,3,1,00:46:20.640,00:46:21.333,00:00:00.693,umm,
850,3,1,00:46:21.786,00:46:22.080,00:00:00.294,,for
851,3,1,00:46:22.879,00:46:23.800,00:00:00.921,p equals four,
852,3,1,00:46:24.253,00:46:26.546,00:00:02.293,I feel like there's a lot of nines in here okay,
853,3,1,00:46:27.826,00:46:28.386,00:00:00.560,,all right great
854,3,1,00:46:30.346,00:46:31.093,00:00:00.747,,next one up

861,3,1,00:46:52.239,00:46:53.306,00:00:01.067,,that equals
862,3,1,00:46:54.093,00:46:56.133,00:00:02.040,umm negative forty one,
863,3,1,00:46:57.400,00:46:58.160,00:00:00.760,equals,

869,3,1,00:47:07.999,00:47:11.602,00:00:03.603,and we don't want to forget about that nineteen,
870,3,1,00:47:13.413,00:47:13.920,00:00:00.507,okay,
871,3,1,00:47:14.386,00:47:15.333,00:00:00.947,so now,
872,3,1,00:47:16.213,00:47:18.280,00:00:02.067,subtract the nineteen,
873,3,1,00:47:21.093,00:47:21.893,00:00:00.800,and,
874,3,1,00:47:23.493,00:47:26.186,00:00:02.693,and okay to make it a hundred,
875,3,1,00:47:27.666,00:47:29.773,00:00:02.107,be a negative hundred sixty,
876,3,1,00:47:30.986,00:47:31.373,00:00:00.387,equals,
877,3,1,00:47:31.933,00:47:33.080,00:00:01.147,forty w,
878,3,1,00:47:35.680,00:47:36.160,00:00:00.480,here we go,
879,3,1,00:47:36.653,00:47:38.560,00:00:01.907,okay this is divided all by forty,
880,3,1,00:47:38.960,00:47:40.973,00:00:02.013,and that would be,
881,3,1,00:47:43.853,00:47:44.786,00:00:00.933,negative four,
882,3,1,00:47:45.226,00:47:47.359,00:00:02.133,yeah w equals negative four,
883,3,1,00:47:47.840,00:47:48.093,00:00:00.253,,yeah
884,3,1,00:47:48.719,00:47:53.519,00:00:04.800,,because remember just regular sixteen divided by four equals four so
885,3,1,00:47:54.426,00:47:54.613,00:00:00.187,okay,
886,3,1,00:47:55.639,00:47:59.066,00:00:03.427,I wonder what all these buttons are doing okay,
887,3,1,00:47:59.746,00:48:01.080,00:00:01.334,continuing on,
888,3,1,00:48:01.547,00:48:02.080,00:00:00.533,,all right great
889,3,1,00:48:02.760,00:48:03.227,00:00:00.467,,okay
890,3,1,00:48:06.213,00:48:08.186,00:00:01.973,umm is he over there,
891,3,1,00:48:08.493,00:48:09.213,00:00:00.720,,I'll go get him
892,3,1,00:48:09.533,00:48:10.453,00:00:00.920,okay beacuse I don't think,
893,3,1,00:48:25.239,00:48:27.387,00:00:02.148,oh candy candy candy oh candy candy,
894,3,1,00:48:41.773,00:48:42.160,00:00:00.387,,okay great
895,3,1,00:48:43.413,00:48:43.879,00:00:00.466,okay,
896,3,1,00:48:47.133,00:48:47.893,00:00:00.760,so,
897,3,1,00:48:51.626,00:48:52.333,00:00:00.707,,all right so
898,3,1,00:48:53.347,00:48:55.413,00:00:02.066,,so first you would start off by
899,3,1,00:48:56.146,00:48:57.106,00:00:00.960,,adding y
900,3,1,00:48:58.840,00:48:59.586,00:00:00.746,plus y,
901,3,1,00:49:00.507,00:49:01.013,00:00:00.506,,because this is
902,3,1,00:49:01.959,00:49:02.426,00:00:00.467,,negative
903,3,1,00:49:03.893,00:49:06.200,00:00:02.307,and then we get negative sixty three,
904,3,1,00:49:07.919,00:49:08.066,00:00:00.147,equals,
905,3,1,00:49:09.000,00:49:11.640,00:00:02.640,forty three plus two y,
906,3,1,00:49:15.013,00:49:16.840,00:00:01.827,,so what do you think the next step is
907,3,1,00:49:18.866,00:49:21.333,00:00:02.467,I think well we've got to get rid of that forty-three,
908,3,1,00:49:21.640,00:49:21.813,00:00:00.173,kill it,
909,3,1,00:49:23.666,00:49:24.053,00:00:00.387,okay,
910,3,1,00:49:24.947,00:49:28.336,00:00:03.389,so we want to subtract forty-three forty-three,
911,3,1,00:49:28.733,00:49:29.599,00:00:00.866,,that cancels
912,3,1,00:49:32.066,00:49:32.586,00:00:00.520,yeah,
913,3,1,00:49:33.787,00:49:33.947,00:00:00.160,like,
914,3,1,00:49:34.586,00:49:35.093,00:00:00.507,here we go,
915,3,1,00:49:36.573,00:49:38.173,00:00:01.600,ohh come on now okay umm,
916,3,1,00:49:40.280,00:49:42.400,00:00:02.120,yeah we want to umm,
917,3,1,00:49:43.346,00:49:45.373,00:00:02.027,add yeah subtract them together,
918,3,1,00:49:45.813,00:49:47.079,00:00:01.266,we got a hundred and six,
919,3,1,00:49:49.813,00:49:50.253,00:00:00.440,equals,
920,3,1,00:49:50.773,00:49:51.173,00:00:00.400,two y,
921,3,1,00:49:53.813,00:49:54.840,00:00:01.027,so divivde it by two,
922,3,1,00:49:57.746,00:49:59.813,00:00:02.067,and get y equals,
923,3,1,00:50:00.440,00:50:00.893,00:00:00.453,fifty three,
924,3,1,00:50:18.173,00:50:19.026,00:00:00.853,,all right so
925,3,1,00:50:19.439,00:50:20.053,00:00:00.614,,oh gosh

928,3,1,00:50:29.573,00:50:31.533,00:00:01.960,okay maybe we should just go to the next one,
929,3,1,00:50:31.586,00:50:33.040,00:00:01.454,,yeah did you get the answer
930,3,1,00:50:33.546,00:50:33.733,00:00:00.187,mm-hmm,
931,3,1,00:50:34.373,00:50:36.226,00:00:01.853,y equals fifty-three right over there,
932,3,1,00:50:38.812,00:50:39.385,00:00:00.573,okay,
933,3,1,00:50:41.066,00:50:43.506,00:00:02.440,okay now they're all like negative p and positive p,
934,3,1,00:50:43.733,00:50:45.706,00:00:01.973,,yeah so you would want to start up by adding p
935,3,1,00:50:58.747,00:51:00.000,00:00:01.253,equals two p okay,
936,3,1,00:51:01.973,00:51:03.640,00:00:01.667,and then umm,

938,3,1,00:51:06.867,00:51:07.813,00:00:00.946,get rid of the three,
939,3,1,00:51:20.026,00:51:21.280,00:00:01.254,that was totally necessary,
940,3,1,00:51:21.426,00:51:21.826,00:00:00.400,,umm

944,3,1,00:51:40.653,00:51:42.446,00:00:01.793,thirty equals two p,
945,3,1,00:51:44.173,00:51:44.506,00:00:00.333,,great
946,3,1,00:51:45.693,00:51:47.613,00:00:01.920,,so then what is that divided by two
947,3,1,00:51:49.107,00:51:52.587,00:00:03.480,p equals negative one hundred and fifteen,
948,3,1,00:51:59.120,00:51:59.387,00:00:00.267,okay,
949,3,1,00:52:00.293,00:52:01.586,00:00:01.293,,so what is your first step

957,3,1,00:52:57.813,00:52:58.933,00:00:01.120,okay g equals,
958,3,1,00:52:59.427,00:52:59.800,00:00:00.373,thirity eight,
959,3,1,00:53:02.800,00:53:03.347,00:00:00.547,that will do it,
960,3,1,00:53:04.360,00:53:04.800,00:00:00.440,,you got it

963,3,1,00:53:10.333,00:53:11.506,00:00:01.173,,all right so add
964,3,1,00:53:11.906,00:53:14.879,00:00:02.973,,m to start off and make it equal on both sides
965,3,1,00:53:15.693,00:53:15.786,00:00:00.093,yup,
966,3,1,00:53:17.107,00:53:18.200,00:00:01.093,I didn't get rid of that m,
967,3,1,00:53:25.920,00:53:27.293,00:00:01.373,okay seventy one,
968,3,1,00:53:28.693,00:53:29.107,00:00:00.414,,so
969,3,1,00:53:29.413,00:53:30.587,00:00:01.174,,rewrite the problem  
970,3,1,00:53:31.106,00:53:33.133,00:00:02.027,equals forty three,
971,3,1,00:53:33.786,00:53:34.266,00:00:00.480,plus,
972,3,1,00:53:34.919,00:53:36.079,00:00:01.160,two m,
973,3,1,00:53:37.039,00:53:39.173,00:00:02.134,I'll subtract the forty-three again,
974,3,1,00:53:41.986,00:53:44.536,00:00:02.550,and then we get that would be,
975,3,1,00:53:45.786,00:53:49.200,00:00:03.414,sixty-eight sixty-eight minus forty,
976,3,1,00:53:49.973,00:53:51.907,00:00:01.934,it should be twenty eight,
977,3,1,00:53:52.586,00:53:53.279,00:00:00.693,equals,
978,3,1,00:53:53.773,00:53:54.707,00:00:00.934,two m,
979,3,1,00:53:55.093,00:53:58.666,00:00:03.573,which we can now divide by two to get,
980,3,1,00:54:00.013,00:54:01.640,00:00:01.627,m equals,
981,3,1,00:54:02.746,00:54:03.266,00:00:00.520,fourteen,
982,3,1,00:54:04.626,00:54:05.493,00:00:00.867,,gosh you are ggod at this
