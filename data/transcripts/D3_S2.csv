00:08:28.262,00:08:37.351,00:00:09.089,,,,,"yes so then you would have to well on the sheet it was like saying that you would have to do seven x"
00:08:37.351,00:08:38.908,00:00:01.557,,,,,"but I guess that's not"
00:08:39.496,00:08:40.265,00:00:00.769,,,,,"well never mind"
00:08:41.103,00:08:43.896,00:00:02.793,,,,"yeah so there's like two ways to do this",
00:08:43.956,00:08:47.458,00:00:03.502,,,,"you could either divide x plus three over seven",
00:08:47.458,00:08:50.352,00:00:02.894,,,,"or you could multiply it plus three over seven",
00:08:51.579,00:08:54.333,00:00:02.754,,,,,"yes so you would have to divide it by three sevens"
00:08:55.151,00:08:58.543,00:00:03.392,,,,"yeah or we could multiply it by the reciprocal",
00:08:59.062,00:09:00.159,00:00:01.097,,,,"because that would also work",
00:09:00.159,00:09:01.846,00:00:01.687,,,,"because that would turn it into one",
00:09:02.534,00:09:03.322,00:00:00.788,,,,,"yeah yeah yeah"
00:09:04.041,00:09:05.398,00:00:01.357,,,,,"so what do you think"
00:09:05.398,00:09:06.126,00:00:00.728,,,,,"what do you"
00:09:07.054,00:09:10.925,00:00:03.871,,,,"pause filler I mean it all depends",
00:09:11.035,00:09:13.759,00:00:02.724,,,,"would you rather divide forty or",
00:09:13.759,00:09:15.604,00:00:01.845,,,,"would you rather multiply over forty",
00:09:15.604,00:09:19.755,00:00:04.151,,,,"probably multiplying might be easier than dividing forty",
00:09:19.934,00:09:22.828,00:00:02.894,,,,,"all right then teach me how to do that then"
00:09:27.280,00:09:29.463,00:00:02.183,,,,"okay okay that's weird oh okay yeah",
00:09:29.463,00:09:32.017,00:00:02.554,,,,"so you would want to do is",
00:09:32.017,00:09:36.696,00:00:04.679,,,,"you would want to just put like forty over here",
00:09:40.223,00:09:40.907,00:00:00.684,,,,"so that works",
00:09:40.907,00:09:45.935,00:00:05.028,,,,"so you I guess you would want to write out forty if you're going to multiply that",
00:09:50.795,00:09:51.543,00:00:00.748,,,,,"all right so then"
00:09:51.543,00:09:59.993,00:00:08.450,,,,"so then pause filler if we're going to multiply it pause filler you're going to just write over here three over seven",
00:09:59.993,00:10:02.009,00:00:02.016,,,,"or seven over three yeah",
00:10:02.009,00:10:03.406,00:00:01.397,,,,"and you want to do a reciprocal",
00:10:02.288,00:10:02.628,00:00:00.340,,,,,"yeah"
00:10:03.515,00:10:03.855,00:00:00.340,,,,,"yeah"
00:10:05.651,00:10:08.225,00:00:02.574,,,,"and I assume you know how to multiply fractions right",
00:10:08.783,00:10:11.896,00:00:03.113,,,,,"I actually haven't learned this for like a year or two"
00:10:11.896,00:10:14.620,00:00:02.724,,,,,"so just refresh me on it"
00:10:14.623,00:10:14.983,00:00:00.360,,,,"ok",
00:10:14.670,00:10:16.603,00:00:01.933,,,,,"I kind of remember but"
00:10:17.392,00:10:21.495,00:00:04.103,,,,"so pause filler basically it's like multiplying normally except",
00:10:21.574,00:10:27.621,00:00:06.047,,,,"you want to multiply the forty times seven and the one times three",
00:10:28.149,00:10:30.384,00:00:02.235,,,,,"okay okay yeah yeah"
00:10:29.333,00:10:29.723,00:00:00.390,,,,"so",
00:10:30.384,00:10:32.639,00:00:02.255,,,,"you just multiply straight across so you get",
00:10:33.248,00:10:34.166,00:00:00.918,,,,,"two hundred eighty"
00:10:34.804,00:10:35.223,00:00:00.419,,,,"yeah",
00:10:38.725,00:10:42.277,00:00:03.552,,,,,"over three right"
00:10:42.277,00:10:45.729,00:00:03.452,,,,,"and then does that pause filler does that simplify"
00:10:42.298,00:10:42.638,00:00:00.340,,,,"yeah",
00:10:46.737,00:10:48.116,00:00:01.379,,,,"pause filler no",
00:10:49.696,00:10:50.696,00:00:01.000,,,,,"all right"
00:10:57.110,00:10:59.190,00:00:02.080,,,,"I guess you could just say that",
00:10:59.204,00:11:00.820,00:00:01.616,,,,"because it would be okay",
00:11:00.724,00:11:01.024,00:00:00.300,,,,,"yeah"
00:11:00.820,00:11:04.039,00:00:03.219,,,,"because you know you probably know (inaudible) okay",
00:11:05.941,00:11:06.311,00:00:00.370,,,,"ah",
00:11:06.333,00:11:07.570,00:00:01.237,,,,,"all right next up"
00:11:07.570,00:11:11.940,00:00:04.370,,,,,"so now do you want to multiply from the reciprocal again"
00:11:12.080,00:11:13.147,00:00:01.067,,,,,"so fourteen"
00:11:13.496,00:11:13.885,00:00:00.389,,,,"yeah",
00:11:15.592,00:11:20.201,00:00:04.609,,,,,"time eight over three"
00:11:21.778,00:11:24.910,00:00:03.132,,,,,"and then that's over one so fourteen times eight"
00:11:26.188,00:11:27.894,00:00:01.706,,,,,"oh gosh what is fourteen times eight"
00:11:28.283,00:11:30.927,00:00:02.644,,,,"see pause filler seven time eight is fifty-six",
00:11:30.927,00:11:33.890,00:00:02.963,,,,"fifty-six times two a hundred and twelve",
00:11:34.429,00:11:36.205,00:00:01.776,,,,,"all right thank you"
00:11:36.893,00:11:38.949,00:00:02.056,,,,,"over three"
00:11:39.607,00:11:39.966,00:00:00.359,,,,"yeah",
00:11:40.484,00:11:42.261,00:00:01.777,,,,,"all right so next up"
00:11:44.326,00:11:45.683,00:00:01.357,,,,,"okay so"
00:11:47.918,00:11:53.625,00:00:05.707,,,,"okay yeah for this one this one you just have you're adding an extra step to it",
00:11:53.625,00:11:57.137,00:00:03.512,,,,"so the first thing want to do is make sure y is alone on this",
00:11:58.354,00:12:05.857,00:00:07.503,,,,,"all right so you're adding eighteen to both sides"
00:12:06.775,00:12:10.355,00:00:03.580,,,,,"so that will equal seventy right"
00:12:11.554,00:12:11.784,00:00:00.230,,,,"pause filler yeah",
00:12:13.500,00:12:22.766,00:00:09.266,,,,,"so seventy negative two thirds y sorry my writing is so messy equals seventy"
00:12:27.229,00:12:38.124,00:00:10.895,,,,,"so you want to do seventy times wait three"
00:12:38.184,00:12:39.770,00:00:01.586,,,,"yeah you wanted to make sure there's a three",
00:12:39.770,00:12:41.452,00:00:01.682,,,,,"yeah wait let me go back"
00:12:50.590,00:12:51.090,00:00:00.500,,,,"okay",
00:12:52.422,00:12:55.375,00:00:02.953,,,,"and you want to just multiply",
00:13:05.000,00:13:05.881,00:00:00.881,,,,,"seven times two equals (inaudible)"
00:13:11.863,00:13:15.729,00:00:03.866,,,,,"and then that would equal to one hundred five"
00:13:15.988,00:13:18.901,00:00:02.913,,,,"yeah maybe you could probably just put a y equals",
00:13:19.550,00:13:26.384,00:00:06.834,,,,,"yeah so finally it's our y equals one hundred"
00:13:26.614,00:13:29.028,00:00:02.414,,,,"except one thing you forgot to do is",
00:13:29.028,00:13:33.708,00:00:04.680,,,,"I'm pretty sure the one o five would be a negative because yeah",
00:13:31.696,00:13:32.216,00:00:00.520,,,,,"oh yeah"
00:13:34.326,00:13:36.910,00:00:02.584,,,,"you know y was a negative so",
00:13:40.000,00:13:41.809,00:00:01.809,,,,,"all right next up"
00:13:45.045,00:13:48.324,00:00:03.279,,,,,"all right so same thing here"
00:13:48.903,00:13:49.262,00:00:00.359,,,,"yeah",
00:13:53.380,00:13:55.987,00:00:02.607,,,,,"so you would want to do minus thirteen on both sides"
00:13:56.705,00:14:02.379,00:00:05.674,,,,,"and that would equal one x equals thirty-one"
00:14:09.456,00:14:17.249,00:00:07.793,,,,,"then thirty-one over three times two over one equals sixty-two"
00:14:17.608,00:14:17.897,00:00:00.289,,,,"yep",
00:14:20.930,00:14:26.308,00:00:05.378,,,,,"so would it be x equals sixty-two then"
00:14:26.308,00:14:27.555,00:00:01.247,,,,"yeah as you said",
00:14:28.144,00:14:32.524,00:00:04.380,,,,"because you can't really do you could divide it by one but that would still be a sixty-two",
00:14:32.539,00:14:32.929,00:00:00.390,,,,,"yeah"
00:14:37.724,00:14:41.344,00:00:03.620,,,,,"yeah okay so this is a little bit different because it's like on the other side"
00:14:41.344,00:14:43.479,00:00:02.135,,,,,"but it's still the same so"
00:14:43.689,00:14:44.178,00:00:00.489,,,,"yeah",
00:14:44.178,00:14:47.000,00:00:02.822,,,,,"add sixteen to both sides"
00:14:51.440,00:14:54.530,00:00:03.090,,,,,"so then you I'm just going to flip this around so three "
00:14:56.180,00:15:01.957,00:00:05.777,,,,,"actually I'm just going to go six over three equals"
00:15:05.757,00:15:07.285,00:00:01.528,,,,,"my gosh it's not even showing up"
00:15:08.193,00:15:08.881,00:00:00.688,,,,"it's not",
00:15:09.400,00:15:10.308,00:00:00.908,,,,,"wait one second"
00:15:11.166,00:15:12.872,00:00:01.706,,,,,"this tip like lagging"
00:15:13.800,00:15:14.249,00:00:00.449,,,,"okay",
00:15:16.315,00:15:20.315,00:00:04.000,,,,,"forty-seven over pause filler"
00:15:21.642,00:15:24.875,00:00:03.233,,,,,"so then oh gosh what's six times forty-seven"
00:15:24.875,00:15:27.599,00:00:02.724,,,,"pause filler well one thing you could do let's see wait (inaudible)",
00:15:27.599,00:15:37.965,00:00:10.366,,,,"I guess before you do that you maybe you could simplify pause filler the sixty over three to like two",
00:15:38.534,00:15:39.412,00:00:00.878,,,,"that might help you",
00:15:39.442,00:15:50.956,00:00:11.514,,,,,"oh yeah so three over one so forty-seven time two equals pause filler fifty-four right"
00:15:52.422,00:16:02.559,00:00:10.137,,,,"well not times two forty-seven would be eighty but mostly fourteen ninety-four because it wouldn't",
00:16:02.559,00:16:09.324,00:00:06.765,,,,,"yeah so ninety-four and then pause filler"
00:16:09.324,00:16:13.505,00:00:04.181,,,,,"that would be over that would just be ninety-four"
00:16:13.330,00:16:13.910,00:00:00.580,,,,"yeah",
00:16:13.505,00:16:15.620,00:00:02.115,,,,,"so x equals ninety-four"
00:16:20.379,00:16:22.275,00:00:01.896,,,,,"I haven't done the reciprocal for a long time"
00:16:22.275,00:16:23.527,00:00:01.252,,,,,"so that's why I'm just"
00:16:24.488,00:16:25.268,00:00:00.780,,,,"it is fun",
00:16:27.533,00:16:29.249,00:00:01.716,,,,,"so big numbers now"
00:16:29.339,00:16:30.496,00:00:01.157,,,,,"minus"
00:16:29.993,00:16:30.483,00:00:00.490,,,,"yeah",
00:16:33.429,00:16:34.607,00:00:01.178,,,,,"forty-eight so"
00:16:43.707,00:16:45.003,00:00:01.296,,,,"yeah so you want to subtract",
00:16:47.093,00:16:48.754,00:00:01.661,,,,,"would that be forty-nine"
00:16:49.173,00:16:49.642,00:00:00.469,,,,"yeah",
00:16:50.356,00:16:50.756,00:00:00.400,,,,,"all right"
00:16:58.491,00:17:02.942,00:00:04.451,,,,,"all right so so that would be five over twelve there"
00:17:02.942,00:17:03.860,00:00:00.918,,,,"yeah",
00:17:04.229,00:17:05.530,00:00:01.301,,,,,"here I'm just going to"
00:17:15.494,00:17:16.082,00:00:00.588,,,,"yeah okay",
00:17:16.082,00:17:18.507,00:00:02.425,,,,"and that would be a y right (inaudible)",
00:17:22.000,00:17:24.513,00:00:02.513,,,,,"all right so forty-nine times five"
00:17:25.353,00:17:27.067,00:00:01.714,,,,,"I wish there was a calculator gosh"
00:17:27.167,00:17:27.786,00:00:00.619,,,,"I know",
00:17:32.000,00:17:39.579,00:00:07.579,,,,,"so nine times five equals pause filler forty-five sorry forty-five"
00:17:40.946,00:17:41.415,00:00:00.469,,,,"forty-five",
00:17:41.415,00:17:44.617,00:00:03.202,,,,"and that equals to a hundred well",
00:17:46.354,00:17:48.249,00:00:01.895,,,,,"one hundred sixty-five"
00:17:49.297,00:17:50.833,00:00:01.536,,,,"no wait that wait",
00:17:51.023,00:17:52.909,00:00:01.886,,,,"forty-five does a hundred and forty-five",
00:17:53.048,00:17:58.376,00:00:05.328,,,,"because forty times five equals two hundred so",
00:18:01.758,00:18:03.748,00:00:01.990,,,,,"are you sure it's not a hundred sixty-five"
00:18:05.450,00:18:06.987,00:00:01.537,,,,"wait maybe",
00:18:06.987,00:18:10.120,00:00:03.133,,,,"oh wait yeah it's forty-nine",
00:18:10.479,00:18:15.208,00:00:04.729,,,,"yeah forty-nine times five equals five okay",
00:18:16.545,00:18:20.346,00:00:03.801,,,,"that's like okay so that's your five right pause filler",
00:18:21.164,00:18:22.681,00:00:01.517,,,,"so you have four over pause filler",
00:18:24.088,00:18:30.239,00:00:06.151,,,,"then as you go like that because you have to have zero there",
00:18:30.891,00:18:32.741,00:00:01.850,,,,"so it would be two hundred forty-five and pause filler five (inaudible)",
00:18:32.747,00:18:33.357,00:00:00.610,,,,,"yeah"
00:18:41.867,00:18:44.102,00:00:02.235,,,,,"all right next page"
00:18:44.531,00:18:46.008,00:00:01.477,,,,,"oh gosh all right"
00:18:46.098,00:18:52.334,00:00:06.236,,,,,"so this one is going to be plus sixty-one to both sides"
00:18:52.543,00:18:52.703,00:00:00.160,,,,"yup",
00:18:52.703,00:18:59.018,00:00:06.315,,,,,"and then you also want to add the two ys y thing right"
00:18:59.168,00:19:00.425,00:00:01.257,,,,,"because that's like (inaudible)"
00:19:00.425,00:19:01.323,00:00:00.898,,,,"yeah so yeah",
00:19:01.323,00:19:04.511,00:00:03.188,,,,"because there is two ones I really want one",
00:19:06.511,00:19:08.016,00:00:01.505,,,,,"what just happened"
00:19:09.016,00:19:09.534,00:00:00.518,,,,"wait a minute",
00:19:09.534,00:19:18.255,00:00:08.721,,,,"so would you really want to so wait which side would you want to have your y on before you do this",
00:19:15.488,00:19:16.069,00:00:00.581,,,,,"em"
00:19:20.090,00:19:22.455,00:00:02.365,,,,,"pause filler I guess this side"
00:19:22.455,00:19:24.091,00:00:01.636,,,,,"like this side over here"
00:19:25.329,00:19:28.252,00:00:02.923,,,,"oh so for that you'd have to subtract the y pause filler",
00:19:28.761,00:19:33.600,00:00:04.839,,,,"no so that would be harder than adding the y over here",
00:19:33.600,00:19:38.339,00:00:04.739,,,,"because I guess if you add it over here then you would get pause filler",
00:19:38.339,00:19:38.519,00:00:00.180,,,,"oh wait (inaudible)",
00:19:38.668,00:19:39.327,00:00:00.659,,,,"huh huh",
00:19:47.100,00:19:48.197,00:00:01.097,,,,"I guess it doesn't make a difference",
00:19:48.197,00:19:53.714,00:00:05.517,,,,"but the y would be you'd have the negative y if you do it this way",
00:19:53.714,00:19:56.558,00:00:02.844,,,,"or you have a positive y if you did it that way",
00:19:57.286,00:19:59.690,00:00:02.404,,,,"so that yeah it doesn't matter that much",
00:19:59.910,00:20:01.017,00:00:01.107,,,,"so I guess yeah",
00:20:01.975,00:20:05.000,00:00:03.025,,,,,"just work through the first step really quick because I'm confused just"
00:20:05.557,00:20:06.226,00:00:00.669,,,,,"I'm sorry"
00:20:07.014,00:20:09.079,00:00:02.065,,,,"yeah pause filler",
00:20:09.209,00:20:16.193,00:00:06.984,,,,"yeah not subtracting sixty-one I mean this one is like a smaller one so I mean",
00:20:18.193,00:20:21.451,00:00:03.258,,,,"usually we'll do the one that was smaller but it doesn't matter exactly",
00:20:24.404,00:20:25.861,00:00:01.457,,,,,"well this one is smaller right"
00:20:25.901,00:20:26.709,00:00:00.808,,,,,"oh yeah so"
00:20:27.509,00:20:32.386,00:00:04.877,,,,"I mean when I add the sixty-five just sixty-one yeah",
00:20:34.192,00:20:36.048,00:00:01.856,,,,,"all right so twenty-five"
00:20:41.046,00:20:41.865,00:00:00.819,,,,"eight-six",
00:20:41.954,00:20:42.274,00:00:00.320,,,,,"yeah"
00:20:56.671,00:20:57.310,00:00:00.639,,,,"okay",
00:20:57.679,00:20:59.205,00:00:01.526,,,,,"oh wait no that's equals"
00:20:59.554,00:21:00.762,00:00:01.208,,,,,"oh my gosh"
00:21:01.360,00:21:01.969,00:00:00.609,,,,,"I'll just"
00:21:21.106,00:21:23.480,00:00:02.374,,,,,"so then you would sub you would oh so how do you add this then"
00:21:23.480,00:21:24.228,00:00:00.748,,,,,"because it's like"
00:21:24.997,00:21:25.476,00:00:00.479,,,,"oh wait",
00:21:25.476,00:21:30.105,00:00:04.629,,,,"so you want to get rid of the wait so now you want to subtract the y right",
00:21:30.105,00:21:32.001,00:00:01.896,,,,"because you only have y on one side",
00:21:32.549,00:21:34.874,00:00:02.325,,,,"and so if you got rid of that y",
00:21:34.874,00:21:37.167,00:00:02.293,,,,"then you would have like a zero so",
00:21:38.925,00:21:45.929,00:00:07.004,,,,,"so would that be negative six over six y then"
00:21:52.657,00:21:52.847,00:00:00.190,,,,"wait",
00:21:52.660,00:21:55.078,00:00:02.418,,,,,"like what is going to get six over seven minus one"
00:21:55.078,00:21:56.844,00:00:01.766,,,,,"because y is one basically"
00:21:57.383,00:22:10.942,00:00:13.559,,,,"well so when you're subtracting that y the y pause filler is really just can be pause filler a negative seven over seven y right",
00:22:10.942,00:22:18.528,00:00:07.586,,,,"so then it would just be a negative thirteen over seven y when you subtract them together",
00:22:18.156,00:22:18.543,00:00:00.387,,,,,"all right"
00:22:26.337,00:22:26.417,00:00:00.080,,,,,"so"
00:22:30.887,00:22:33.142,00:00:02.255,,,,"so then once you have that y",
00:22:47.000,00:22:47.639,00:00:00.639,,,,"you have that",
00:22:47.639,00:22:51.525,00:00:03.886,,,,"and then you just want to multiply it by seven over thirteen",
00:22:53.525,00:22:55.431,00:00:01.906,,,,"mm-hmm that's lovely",
00:22:56.469,00:22:59.140,00:00:02.671,,,,,"so what's eighty-six times seven"
00:23:00.192,00:23:00.861,00:00:00.669,,,,"emm",
00:23:03.433,00:23:07.000,00:00:03.567,,,,"I dont know okay (inaudible) okay eight six times seven two two",
00:23:35.797,00:23:36.772,00:00:00.975,,,,"maybe six hundred and two",
00:23:38.447,00:23:39.091,00:00:00.644,,,,,"all right"
00:23:41.398,00:23:42.478,00:00:01.080,,,,," so six hundred two and then "
00:23:45.913,00:23:50.815,00:00:04.902,,,,,"that is over over negative thirteen "
00:23:47.417,00:23:47.785,00:00:00.368,,,,"divide",
00:23:51.043,00:23:51.435,00:00:00.392,,,,"yeah",
00:23:52.410,00:23:54.036,00:00:01.626,,,,,"I'm just going to go with that you know"
00:23:56.481,00:23:58.537,00:00:02.056,,,,"put a little negative sign then",
00:23:58.650,00:23:59.177,00:00:00.527,,,,"there we go",
00:24:00.539,00:24:01.876,00:00:01.337,,,,,"all right let's move onto the next one"
00:24:03.002,00:24:06.196,00:00:03.194,,,,,"all right so let's just start off by adding a two"
00:24:19.754,00:24:22.374,00:00:02.620,,,,,"so this cancels out then"
00:24:23.355,00:24:23.773,00:00:00.418,,,,"yep",
00:24:29.173,00:24:30.750,00:00:01.577,,,,"and then you just have",
00:24:31.871,00:24:32.656,00:00:00.785,,,,,"one hundred"
00:24:33.276,00:24:33.730,00:00:00.454,,,,"yep {laughter}",
00:24:35.091,00:24:35.478,00:00:00.387,,,,,"so"
00:24:36.407,00:24:36.986,00:00:00.579,,,,"you have",
00:24:38.073,00:24:41.924,00:00:03.851,,,,,"plus ten over third x"
00:24:41.924,00:24:45.776,00:00:03.852,,,,,"and then negative eleven x is left over on the other side"
00:24:46.354,00:24:52.890,00:00:06.536,,,,,"so now you want to add eleven x right"
00:24:53.089,00:24:59.904,00:00:06.815,,,,,"so then would that be if you're adding eleven x would that be"
00:25:06.504,00:25:09.262,00:00:02.758,,,,"pause filler wait if you're adding wait if you're adding elevenx",
00:25:09.701,00:25:13.732,00:00:04.031,,,,,"would that be eleven and then ten over three"
00:25:14.830,00:25:23.470,00:00:08.640,,,,"okay if you're going to do that then on the other side you have zero equals scribble",
00:25:24.578,00:25:32.450,00:00:07.872,,,,"so then you only want you want to have x on one side and the hundred on the other",
00:25:32.769,00:25:36.411,00:00:03.642,,,,"so you don't want to do that",
00:25:36.411,00:25:40.821,00:00:04.410,,,,"you would either have to pause filler put the hundred on the other side or",
00:25:40.821,00:25:44.203,00:00:03.382,,,,"you would have to subtract your ten x (inaudible)",
00:25:50.501,00:25:51.407,00:00:00.906,,,,"do you get that",
00:25:53.173,00:25:54.190,00:00:01.017,,,,,"all right so pause filler"
00:26:00.190,00:26:02.042,00:00:01.852,,,,"so which one would you rather do",
00:26:03.072,00:26:05.235,00:00:02.163,,,,"so you could either subtract a hundred",
00:26:05.694,00:26:08.019,00:00:02.325,,,,"or you could subtract ten x",
00:26:10.004,00:26:14.484,00:00:04.480,,,,"the ten x will probably have less steps in here because you already put a hundred on one side",
00:26:14.680,00:26:15.288,00:00:00.608,,,,,"alright"
00:26:16.257,00:26:17.386,00:00:01.129,,,,,"so subtract ten x"
00:26:28.749,00:26:38.978,00:00:10.229,,,,,"that would be negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three"
00:26:40.884,00:26:42.670,00:00:01.786,,,,"wait wait pause filler",
00:26:47.330,00:26:48.655,00:00:01.325,,,,"yeah it looks right",
00:26:49.265,00:26:50.442,00:00:01.177,,,,,"three x or three"
00:26:52.647,00:26:58.228,00:00:05.581,,,,"well you pause filler wait one second sorry",
00:26:58.557,00:26:59.005,00:00:00.448,,,,,"it is okay"
00:27:03.523,00:27:04.032,00:00:00.509,,,,"wait a minute pause filler",
00:27:04.979,00:27:08.900,00:00:03.921,,,,"I'm sorry I like zoned out for a couple second wait",
00:27:08.900,00:27:12.422,00:00:03.522,,,,"so you added the eleven x",
00:27:12.422,00:27:13.698,00:00:01.276,,,,"is that what you ended up doing",
00:27:22.107,00:27:26.840,00:00:04.733,,,,,"pause filler I well then you say that you could subtract ten x from both sides"
00:27:26.840,00:27:28.227,00:00:01.387,,,,"yeah so is that what you did",
00:27:28.386,00:27:28.785,00:00:00.399,,,,,"yeah so"
00:27:28.785,00:27:28.935,00:00:00.150,,,,"okay so",
00:27:28.935,00:27:34.083,00:00:05.148,,,,,"so negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three"
00:27:34.083,00:27:34.562,00:00:00.479,,,,"no no no",
00:27:34.562,00:27:39.072,00:00:04.510,,,,"so your question is would it be a negative twenty-one x",
00:27:39.800,00:27:41.945,00:00:02.145,,,,"because you still have to divide it by three",
00:27:41.945,00:27:42.823,00:00:00.878,,,,"so I'm pretty sure it won't",
00:27:43.103,00:27:45.388,00:00:02.285,,,,"but yeah I'm getting confused",
00:27:45.687,00:27:48.131,00:00:02.444,,,,"wait no wait no",
00:27:48.131,00:27:56.442,00:00:08.311,,,,"you can't do that yeah because pause filler yeah you can't put the divided by three thing underneath that because that wouldn't work",
00:27:58.019,00:28:01.531,00:00:03.512,,,,"so ten over three",
00:28:02.628,00:28:03.776,00:00:01.148,,,,,"so you would have to"
00:28:03.776,00:28:12.506,00:00:08.730,,,,"so your negative eleven x because negative eleven is like over one and",
00:28:12.606,00:28:15.140,00:00:02.534,,,,,"wouldn't you multiply it by three x probably"
00:28:16.587,00:28:22.334,00:00:05.747,,,,"well you're not trying to get rid well you're trying to get rid on that side by subtraction not multiplication",
00:28:23.780,00:28:25.067,00:00:01.287,,,,"so what you can do",
00:28:25.067,00:28:25.965,00:00:00.898,,,"how did it go",,
00:28:26.444,00:28:29.697,00:00:03.253,,,,,"It's going good"
00:28:29.697,00:28:33.009,00:00:03.312,,,"cool all right so this is the end of the first tutoring session",,
00:28:33.009,00:28:33.528,00:00:00.519,,,,,"all right"
00:28:33.817,00:28:39.694,00:00:05.877,,,"pause filler we have to test some things out",,
00:28:39.694,00:28:42.518,00:00:02.824,,,"and in to the server pause filler",,
00:28:42.817,00:28:45.671,00:00:02.854,,,"and it would be a few minutes so",,
00:28:45.760,00:28:46.509,00:00:00.749,,,"(inaudible) (laughter) some things",,
00:28:46.678,00:28:48.973,00:00:02.295,,,"so I'll be back in a few minutes pause filler (inaudible)",,
00:28:48.973,00:28:49.332,00:00:00.359,,,,,"okay"
00:28:49.332,00:28:50.769,00:00:01.437,,"(inaudible) this worksheet from you",,,
00:28:50.809,00:28:51.218,00:00:00.409,,,,"okay",
00:28:51.777,00:28:57.703,00:00:05.926,,"all right so now we'll switch things up and (inaudible)",,,
00:28:57.703,00:28:58.342,00:00:00.639,,,,"okay",
00:28:58.342,00:29:01.095,00:00:02.753,,"so before we start I'm just going to pause filler",,,
00:29:01.095,00:29:06.513,00:00:05.418,,"I need to get something set up on hand and (inaudible)",,,
00:29:06.513,00:29:14.495,00:00:07.982,,"all right so I'll be back in a few minutes",,,
00:29:16.451,00:29:24.003,00:00:07.552,,"this is well I'm getting some things ready",,,

00:29:49.560,00:29:51.595,00:00:02.035,,,,"I haven't had Skittles in like forever",
00:29:51.766,00:29:52.435,00:00:00.669,,,,,"me neither"
00:30:11.520,00:30:16.398,00:00:04.878,,,,"huh that is somewhat weird on the back it says a blue one is blue raspberry",
00:30:16.664,00:30:18.420,00:00:01.756,,,,"but it doesn't say like blue raspberry",
00:30:18.420,00:30:19.637,00:00:01.217,,,,"it just says raspberry",
00:30:20.787,00:30:24.606,00:00:03.819,,,,,"okay so you know what like those marshmallow Peeps are right"

00:30:24.705,00:30:27.768,00:00:03.063,,,,,"so my mom just buy pause filler Peeps"
00:30:27.768,00:30:30.652,00:00:02.884,,,,,"but they're blue raspberry flavored"

00:36:44.402,00:36:48.283,00:00:03.881,,,,"is your thing set up as one over x equals twenty-five",
00:36:49.171,00:36:49.411,00:00:00.240,,,,,"yes"
00:36:50.459,00:36:50.628,00:00:00.169,,,,"okay",

00:36:52.514,00:36:53.482,00:00:00.968,,,,,"where did the pen go"
00:36:56.136,00:36:57.482,00:00:01.346,,,,,"I swear I'm going insane"
00:36:57.816,00:36:58.171,00:00:00.355,,,,,"one second"
00:37:45.082,00:37:45.658,00:00:00.576,,,,"did you find it",
00:37:46.110,00:37:46.576,00:00:00.466,,,,,"yeah"
00:37:47.153,00:37:47.864,00:00:00.711,,,,"what was it",
00:37:49.426,00:37:50.063,00:00:00.637,,,,,"he had the pen"
00:37:50.063,00:37:51.714,00:00:01.651,,,,,"he certainly grabbed it"
00:37:53.491,00:37:53.932,00:00:00.441,,,,,"all right"
00:37:55.061,00:37:55.270,00:00:00.209,,,,"okay",
00:37:55.258,00:37:55.601,00:00:00.343,,,,,"so"
00:38:00.104,00:38:01.349,00:00:01.245,,,,,"now do you know how to do this"
00:38:01.349,00:38:04.510,00:00:03.161,,,,,"we're going to start off by multiplying by x on both sides"
00:38:05.411,00:38:05.957,00:00:00.546,,,,"okay",
00:38:06.146,00:38:06.539,00:00:00.393,,,,"so",
00:38:10.674,00:38:12.601,00:00:01.927,,,,"you multiply by x on the scribble",
00:38:14.000,00:38:16.553,00:00:02.553,,,,,"well actually never mind"
00:38:17.082,00:38:17.930,00:00:00.848,,,,,"that was wrong"
00:38:18.043,00:38:18.601,00:00:00.558,,,,,"wait"
00:38:21.130,00:38:22.938,00:00:01.808,,,,," I'm looking at the tutor worksheet"
00:38:33.105,00:38:35.600,00:00:02.495,,,,,"yeah you do multiply both sides by x okay"
00:38:35.816,00:38:36.668,00:00:00.852,,,,"okay so",
00:38:38.784,00:38:40.533,00:00:01.749,,,," and so you multiply that by x",
00:38:42.274,00:38:46.605,00:00:04.331,,,,"then you get one x over x",
00:38:46.654,00:38:48.021,00:00:01.367,,,,"so that could be one",
00:38:48.021,00:38:50.955,00:00:02.934,,,,,"oh yeah that would just be one no x on this side"
00:38:50.955,00:38:52.820,00:00:01.865,,,,,"after you multiply on this side"
00:38:52.820,00:38:54.048,00:00:01.228,,,,,"after you multiply it by x"
00:38:55.846,00:38:56.570,00:00:00.724,,,,,"it pause filler it cancels out the x"
00:38:56.570,00:38:59.116,00:00:02.546,,,,,"so then that would be twenty-five x"
00:38:59.791,00:39:00.147,00:00:00.356,,,,"yeah",
00:39:01.533,00:39:01.865,00:00:00.332,,,," so",
00:39:02.565,00:39:05.289,00:00:02.724,,,,," then you divide it by twenty-five on both sides"
00:39:07.128,00:39:07.487,00:00:00.359,,,,"okay",
00:39:15.220,00:39:21.256,00:00:06.036,,,,"okay so then you have x equals one over twenty-five",
00:39:38.546,00:39:40.711,00:00:02.165,,,,,"all right oh you all right okay"
00:39:43.605,00:39:47.626,00:00:04.021,,,,,"so you want to start off by adding seventeen"
00:39:47.626,00:39:48.663,00:00:01.037,,,,,"now what do you do next"
00:39:48.663,00:39:51.208,00:00:02.545,,,,,"you add a number to the sides"
00:39:51.208,00:39:53.672,00:00:02.464,,,,"okay pause filler okay yeah it makes sense",
00:39:53.672,00:39:55.817,00:00:02.145,,,,"so you just add the seventeen",
00:39:59.649,00:40:02.372,00:00:02.723,,,,"and then you would get eighty",
00:40:02.372,00:40:06.663,00:00:04.291,,,,,"yeah so negative three over y equals eighty"
00:40:11.761,00:40:14.744,00:00:02.983,,,,,"now you want to multiply it by y on both sides"
00:40:14.874,00:40:24.502,00:00:09.628,,,,"okay so one pause filler negative three equals eighty-y",
00:40:25.560,00:40:30.598,00:00:05.038,,,,"this you would want to divide it by y",
00:40:34.900,00:40:36.575,00:00:01.675,,,,"no you would want to divide it by",
00:40:36.575,00:40:37.951,00:00:01.376,,,,"no you would want to divide by",
00:40:37.951,00:40:38.351,00:00:00.400,,,,,"eighty"
00:40:38.750,00:40:39.288,00:00:00.538,,,,"eighty",
00:40:46.815,00:40:52.820,00:00:06.005,,,,"so then you would get y equals negative three over eighty",
00:40:53.037,00:40:57.527,00:00:04.490,,,,"that must be okay that was this is beautiful okay",
00:41:02.545,00:41:03.606,00:00:01.061,,,,"okay next",
00:41:03.615,00:41:04.394,00:00:00.779,,,,,"all right"
00:41:06.331,00:41:09.656,00:00:03.325,,,,,"so two hundred ten equals negative fourteen over y"
00:41:09.659,00:41:11.330,00:00:01.671,,,,,"what do you think your first step is going to be"
00:41:12.762,00:41:15.646,00:00:02.884,,,,"pause filler so you multiply it by y yeah",
00:41:17.846,00:41:19.557,00:00:01.711,,,,,"so that cancels that out on this side"
00:41:19.707,00:41:22.131,00:00:02.424,,,,,"and then you can equal two hundred ten"
00:41:22.131,00:41:23.887,00:00:01.756,,,,"so you got negative yes",
00:41:23.887,00:41:31.767,00:00:07.880,,,,"and then you get two hundred and ten y equals negative fourteen",
00:41:32.976,00:41:40.263,00:00:07.287,,,,"okay so after you do that you pause filler want to divide everything by twenty-five",
00:41:42.680,00:41:43.545,00:00:00.865,,,,,"yeah so you"
00:41:50.558,00:41:52.828,00:00:02.270,,,,," so you're left with y on one side"
00:41:54.288,00:41:56.526,00:00:02.238,,,,,"because the two hundred ten is canceled out"
00:41:57.294,00:41:57.846,00:00:00.552,,,,"mm-hmm",
00:42:00.276,00:42:01.159,00:00:00.883,,,,"you're both uh-huh ",
00:42:04.889,00:42:06.411,00:00:01.522,,,," wait seven ",
00:42:16.908,00:42:18.086,00:00:01.178,,,,"that looks good",
00:42:20.558,00:42:21.558,00:00:01.000,,,,"okay so",
00:42:23.300,00:42:24.153,00:00:00.853,,,,"this one",
00:42:24.515,00:42:26.625,00:00:02.110,,,,,"you want to start off by adding twenty-four to both sides"
00:42:34.503,00:42:35.215,00:00:00.712,,,,"and then",
00:42:37.798,00:42:44.220,00:00:06.422,,,,"one hundred thirty-seven equals five over x",
00:42:47.220,00:42:50.231,00:00:03.011,,,,"and then like the other ones you would want to multiply it by x",
00:42:50.570,00:42:51.099,00:00:00.529,,,,,"correct"
00:42:54.288,00:43:01.607,00:00:07.319,,,,"and one hundred thirty-seven x equals five ",
00:43:05.294,00:43:06.754,00:00:01.460,,,,"divided by hundred thirty-seven",
00:43:07.513,00:43:07.872,00:00:00.359,,,,,"perfect"
00:43:10.036,00:43:10.496,00:00:00.460,,,,"yep",
00:43:11.907,00:43:13.122,00:00:01.215,,,,"x equals ",
00:43:16.497,00:43:17.061,00:00:00.564,,,,"ah",
00:43:18.264,00:43:21.331,00:00:03.067,,,,"one hundred thirty-seven yeah",
00:43:29.036,00:43:29.588,00:00:00.552,,,,,"you got it"
00:43:30.171,00:43:31.466,00:00:01.295,,,,"yeah okay",
00:43:32.373,00:43:33.336,00:00:00.963,,,,"next one",
00:43:35.429,00:43:35.987,00:00:00.558,,,,,"yup"
00:43:36.915,00:43:37.479,00:00:00.564,,,,"brah",
00:43:39.270,00:43:39.613,00:00:00.343,,,,"yeah",
00:43:39.806,00:43:41.722,00:00:01.916,,,,,"all right oh so this is different"
00:43:42.722,00:43:43.271,00:00:00.549,,,,"yeah",
00:43:43.000,00:43:46.713,00:00:03.713,,,,,"so you negative thirty-nine is smaller"
00:43:46.713,00:43:50.000,00:00:03.287,,,,,"so you probably want to start off by adding thirty-nine to both sides"
00:43:53.135,00:43:53.785,00:00:00.650,,,,"ah",
00:43:54.012,00:43:54.896,00:00:00.884,,,,"well what if",
00:43:57.010,00:43:58.027,00:00:01.017,,,," yeah it makes sense",
00:44:05.131,00:44:10.759,00:00:05.628,,,,,"so remember that seventeen over x and twelve over x are like terms"
00:44:11.188,00:44:17.743,00:00:06.555,,,,,"so you probably want to subtract twelve x from both sides"
00:44:18.581,00:44:20.885,00:00:02.304,,,,"yeah okay one second",
00:44:20.885,00:44:22.452,00:00:01.567,,,,"let me just get this up",
00:44:22.452,00:44:27.720,00:00:05.268,,,,"equals twelve x or soon not to be twelve x",
00:44:27.810,00:44:33.676,00:00:05.866,,,,"oh it's twenty-one (inaudible) eighteen eighteen",
00:44:36.742,00:44:45.264,00:00:08.522,,,,"we can subtract that to get pause filler five over x equals eighteen",
00:44:46.198,00:44:47.086,00:00:00.888,,,,,"all right yup"
00:44:47.086,00:44:56.495,00:00:09.409,,,,"multiply it by x to get five pause filler equals eighteen x",
00:44:56.495,00:45:05.055,00:00:08.560,,,,"and we can divide by eighteen to get on with over here pause filler",
00:45:06.711,00:45:10.962,00:00:04.251,,,,"five over eighteen equals x",
00:45:15.214,00:45:16.788,00:00:01.574,,,,"that's so sloppy",
00:45:16.938,00:45:17.357,00:00:00.419,,,,"and x",
00:45:18.680,00:45:19.784,00:00:01.104,,,,"and next",
00:45:21.109,00:45:23.208,00:00:02.099,,,,,"all right so this one is very similar"
00:45:24.700,00:45:25.903,00:00:01.203,,,,,"so negative nine and two are smaller"
00:45:26.122,00:45:27.472,00:00:01.350,,,,,"so what would you do with that"
00:45:29.000,00:45:32.588,00:00:03.588,,,,"pause filler so you would want to you want to add it",
00:45:38.579,00:45:42.264,00:00:03.685,,,,"and you get plus another ninety-two",
00:45:45.264,00:46:00.719,00:00:15.455,,,,"okay pause filler then you have three x equals pause filler a hundred and three plus twelve x",
00:46:01.048,00:46:03.700,00:00:02.652,,,,"and then you want to subtract with twelve x",
00:46:04.510,00:46:06.326,00:00:01.816,,,,"get rid of that until (inaudible)",
00:46:06.326,00:46:08.541,00:00:02.215,,,,,"well twelve over x remember"
00:46:08.960,00:46:10.037,00:00:01.077,,,,"oh yeah (laughter)",
00:46:10.297,00:46:13.240,00:00:02.943,,,,,"but it's okay you still subtract"
00:46:13.400,00:46:13.689,00:00:00.289,,,,"here",
00:46:13.689,00:46:18.688,00:00:04.999,,,,,"but you should subtract pause filler three x right three over x first"
00:46:19.466,00:46:20.973,00:00:01.507,,,,"you did that one",
00:46:20.973,00:46:27.089,00:00:06.116,,,,"it could be a zero equals a hundred three plus fifteen x",
00:46:29.089,00:46:34.093,00:00:05.004,,,,,"no because if you're subtracting pause filler three over x on from twelve"
00:46:34.502,00:46:40.528,00:00:06.026,,,,,"then it would be pause filler nine over x like one hundred three"
00:46:40.528,00:46:44.679,00:00:04.151,,,,"pause filler yeah one second yeah",
00:46:44.998,00:46:47.712,00:00:02.714,,,,,"oh well actually right you're right sorry"
00:46:47.712,00:46:48.650,00:00:00.938,,,,"okay",
00:46:48.650,00:46:49.827,00:00:01.177,,,,,"so you would subtract twelve x"
00:46:49.827,00:46:53.139,00:00:03.312,,,,,"because three x is on the other equal side of the"
00:46:53.139,00:46:59.126,00:00:05.987,,,,"okay so minus twelve x",
00:47:03.637,00:47:05.570,00:00:01.933,,,,"yeah that's a beautiful x (laughter)",
00:47:07.497,00:47:14.730,00:00:07.233,,,,"so then you know being negative nine yeah negative yeah twelve over x",
00:47:14.730,00:47:21.315,00:00:06.585,,,,"and we got negative nine x equals a hundred and three",
00:47:26.000,00:47:26.926,00:00:00.926,,,,"that makes sense",
00:47:28.010,00:47:29.367,00:00:01.357,,,,"okay and then",
00:47:29.368,00:47:30.276,00:00:00.908,,,,,"you divide by"
00:47:35.975,00:47:37.398,00:00:01.423,,,,,"well you so you multiply I mean"
00:47:40.601,00:47:43.816,00:00:03.215,,,,"I guess you could divide right",
00:47:44.889,00:47:45.515,00:00:00.626,,,,"maybe",
00:47:52.681,00:47:54.270,00:00:01.589,,,,"I think you could divide",
00:48:00.699,00:48:01.362,00:00:00.663,,,,"okay",
00:48:06.064,00:48:10.264,00:00:04.200,,,,"x wait no nine equals",
00:48:10.264,00:48:12.639,00:00:02.375,,,,,"how do you get your screen to go lower"
00:48:12.639,00:48:14.365,00:00:01.726,,,,,"because I can't see what you're doing"
00:48:14.932,00:48:15.607,00:00:00.675,,,,"you can't ",
00:48:19.454,00:48:22.367,00:00:02.913,,,,"see how far can you see to what I'm doing",
00:48:24.222,00:48:25.470,00:00:01.248,,,,,"I can see"
00:48:27.319,00:48:29.371,00:00:02.052,,,,"here I'm going to write a bunch of numbers",
00:48:29.371,00:48:30.817,00:00:01.446,,,,"tell me which ones you can see",
00:48:30.817,00:48:32.214,00:00:01.397,,,,"can you see any of those",
00:48:32.593,00:48:34.280,00:00:01.687,,,,,"I can see one two three and four"
00:48:34.659,00:48:36.954,00:00:02.295,,,,"okay so you can't see five and six pause filler",
00:48:36.954,00:48:41.580,00:00:04.626,,,,"okay now I'll get rid of those pause filler okay pause filler",
00:48:44.237,00:48:51.680,00:00:07.443,,,,"huh is your pause filler scribbler screen like fully like",
00:48:51.680,00:48:55.252,00:00:03.572,,,,"is it from like one end to the screen all the way up to the other",
00:48:56.619,00:48:59.000,00:00:02.381,,,,,"well it is now because I've just made it bigger but it's"
00:49:00.353,00:49:02.402,00:00:02.049,,,,"can you see nine equals one hundred threex",
00:49:05.970,00:49:06.602,00:00:00.632,,,,,"yes I"
00:49:08.349,00:49:08.754,00:00:00.405,,,,,"wait"
00:49:11.270,00:49:11.939,00:00:00.669,,,,,"it's okay"
00:49:12.263,00:49:13.201,00:00:00.938,,,,,"just keep working"
00:49:13.201,00:49:14.798,00:00:01.597,,,,,"I can fix it"
00:49:16.803,00:49:17.471,00:00:00.668,,,,,"just keep working"
00:49:17.471,00:49:17.900,00:00:00.429,,,,,"it's okay"
00:49:18.595,00:49:19.545,00:00:00.950,,,,"ops one second",
00:49:24.000,00:49:25.362,00:00:01.362,,,,"actually a way to scroll down",
00:49:25.577,00:49:28.267,00:00:02.690,,,,"you can just probably use a scroll button pause filler",
00:49:28.267,00:49:28.610,00:00:00.343,,,,"no that one",
00:49:28.693,00:49:29.085,00:00:00.392,,,,"like okay",
00:49:29.570,00:49:29.877,00:00:00.307,,,,"yeah okay",
00:49:31.559,00:49:33.156,00:00:01.597,,,,"I'll just try and go with it",
00:49:34.323,00:49:38.314,00:00:03.991,,,,"so then I go pause filler one hundred and three x oh (laughter) pause filler",
00:49:43.033,00:49:45.278,00:00:02.245,,,,"yes you divide a hundred and three",
00:49:45.278,00:49:50.602,00:00:05.324,,,,"so you got nine over a hundred and three equals x",
00:49:53.200,00:49:57.630,00:00:04.430,,,,"there we go okay",
00:49:59.147,00:50:01.511,00:00:02.364,,,,"and next one",
00:50:02.958,00:50:06.400,00:00:03.442,,,,,"all right so twenty-five is smaller"
00:50:06.400,00:50:09.000,00:00:02.600,,,,,"so you want to start up by subtracting that from both sides right"
00:50:10.129,00:50:11.086,00:00:00.957,,,,"ah yeah",
00:50:23.012,00:50:23.503,00:00:00.491,,,,"come on",
00:50:24.369,00:50:28.707,00:00:04.338,,,,"that's sort of like I just want to know what that looks like",
00:50:30.136,00:50:46.589,00:00:16.453,,,,"then got one over x no wait and then that will be plus thirty-five equals nine over x",
00:50:49.871,00:50:53.962,00:00:04.091,,,,"and then since you have that already",
00:50:54.351,00:50:58.173,00:00:03.822,,,,"you want to get rid of the one over x",
00:50:58.482,00:51:00.577,00:00:02.095,,,,"and it's just the bottoms all (inaudible) is",
00:51:00.577,00:51:01.864,00:00:01.287,,,,"you can just subtract that",
00:51:01.864,00:51:04.299,00:00:02.435,,,,,"yes so you subtract one over x on both sides"
00:51:04.738,00:51:05.975,00:00:01.237,,,,,"and then you would end up with"
00:51:06.953,00:51:09.916,00:00:02.963,,,,"thirty-five equals eight overx",
00:51:13.245,00:51:19.000,00:00:05.755,,,,,"so then you would want to multiply it by x on both sides to cancel out the x on this side"
00:51:19.402,00:51:24.632,00:00:05.230,,,,"well I was thinking pause filler since pause filler since the wait",
00:51:24.942,00:51:27.207,00:00:02.265,,,,"you could try dividing by eight",
00:51:27.207,00:51:28.841,00:00:01.634,,,,"do you think that would work",
00:51:30.240,00:51:34.793,00:00:04.553,,,,,"well on my tutor sheet it doesn't say anything about dividing by eight so"
00:51:38.641,00:51:44.158,00:00:05.517,,,,,"I think you would just I think that it would just pause filler give you extra steps that you don't plan"
00:51:44.537,00:51:52.150,00:00:07.613,,,,"well maybe well I guess if you multiply if you divide it by x when you just have x right x by itself",
00:51:53.646,00:51:56.001,00:00:02.355,,,,,"no because it's dividing anyway"
00:51:56.001,00:51:58.166,00:00:02.165,,,,,"like eight it is divided by x anyway so pause filler"
00:51:58.865,00:52:01.249,00:00:02.384,,,,,"you would have to multiply it or something"
00:52:01.279,00:52:02.716,00:00:01.437,,,,,"but it just it's pause filler"
00:52:05.659,00:52:06.210,00:00:00.551,,,,"okay",
00:52:06.230,00:52:07.873,00:00:01.643,,,,,"it would be too complicated I guess"
00:52:11.405,00:52:12.773,00:00:01.368,,,,,"on all of the things it says to"
00:52:14.760,00:52:15.632,00:00:00.872,,,,"multiply x",
00:52:16.724,00:52:17.264,00:00:00.540,,,,,"yeah"
00:52:20.765,00:52:20.994,00:00:00.229,,,,"okay",
00:52:21.154,00:52:26.731,00:00:05.577,,,,"wait so then you get thirty-five x equals eight",
00:52:26.731,00:52:28.843,00:00:02.112,,,,"or so we just divide it by thirty-five",
00:52:30.443,00:52:38.907,00:00:08.464,,,,"and you get x equals like could you see that stuff on the bottom I was doing",
00:52:40.779,00:52:41.358,00:00:00.579,,,,,"pause filler no I couldn't"
00:52:41.358,00:52:42.812,00:00:01.454,,,,,"but I can see what you're doing right now"
00:52:42.812,00:52:45.510,00:00:02.698,,,,"okay x equals eight over thirty-five pause filler",
00:52:50.320,00:52:55.208,00:00:04.888,,,,"but on this problem could you just draw a line at the bottom of the page that where you can see",
00:52:55.711,00:52:56.221,00:00:00.510,,,,,"yeah"
00:52:56.356,00:52:57.368,00:00:01.012,,,,"okay that way",
00:53:01.816,00:53:02.656,00:00:00.840,,,,,"all right wait"
00:53:07.840,00:53:08.399,00:00:00.559,,,,"okay",
00:53:12.282,00:53:13.969,00:00:01.687,,,,"okay so you can see all the stuff",
00:53:15.710,00:53:21.896,00:00:06.186,,,,,"all right so you're going to start off by subtracting twenty-two"
00:53:26.634,00:53:29.858,00:00:03.224,,,,"and then you get a hundred and three",
00:53:31.295,00:53:31.514,00:00:00.219,,,,,"yup"
00:53:31.953,00:53:36.762,00:00:04.809,,,,"plus ten x and then ninex",
00:53:44.957,00:53:45.595,00:00:00.638,,,,"and then",
00:53:47.466,00:53:49.325,00:00:01.859,,,,"you're going to get rid of the tenx",
00:53:51.343,00:53:51.742,00:00:00.399,,,,,"so"
00:53:52.447,00:53:55.140,00:00:02.693,,,,,"you probably want to subtract"
00:54:01.399,00:54:11.030,00:00:09.631,,,,"yeah so then you get a hundred three equals pause filler negative one x",
00:54:29.122,00:54:32.294,00:00:03.172,,,,,"all right so then you want to multiply"
00:54:32.895,00:54:35.300,00:00:02.405,,,,"we just try something out",
00:54:35.300,00:54:38.281,00:00:02.981,,,,"because if you multiply that by negative one x",
00:54:41.835,00:54:49.208,00:00:07.373,,,,"and then it would be negative one right over negative one x right",
00:54:51.543,00:54:53.594,00:00:02.051,,,,"and then you could cancel out the negative one",
00:54:56.442,00:55:00.054,00:00:03.612,,,,,"well if you see look at number nine on here"
00:55:01.121,00:55:03.625,00:00:02.504,,,,,"this is like a really similar problem"
00:55:03.625,00:55:05.471,00:00:01.846,,,,,"and you can kind of see what they're doing"
00:55:05.990,00:55:06.951,00:00:00.961,,,,,"it's not really like"
