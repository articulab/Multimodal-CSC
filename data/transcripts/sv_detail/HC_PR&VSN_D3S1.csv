00:04:02.851,00:04:06.013,00:00:03.162,,,,,,,,,,,"so like what I do is before I started erasing the problem",,,,
00:04:06.263,00:04:08.647,00:00:02.384,,,,,,,,,,,"so I think I'm just going to have to rewrite that problem",,,,

00:04:38.539,00:04:46.811,00:00:08.272,,,,,,,,,,,"so I guess pause filler you need to get x on leave only a thing on one side",,,,
00:04:46.811,00:04:48.906,00:00:02.095,,,,,,,,,,,"so you're going to have to get rid of three",,,,
00:04:49.006,00:04:52.278,00:00:03.272,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so would you have to subtract three from both sides",,,

00:05:05.398,00:05:10.896,00:00:05.498,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you're just left with x equals",,,
00:05:12.632,00:05:14.178,00:00:01.546,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right thanks for your patience",,

00:07:21.529,00:07:21.948,00:00:00.419,,,,,,,,,,,"let's see",,,,
00:07:22.217,00:07:23.544,00:00:01.327,,,,,,,,,,,"is that one it",,,,
00:07:24.841,00:07:26.687,00:00:01.846,,,,,,,,,,,"no that is not it",,,,

00:07:29.720,00:07:30.509,00:00:00.789,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,"all right great",,,
00:07:30.658,00:07:35.637,00:00:04.979,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you're going to work me through these problems I guess",,,
00:07:36.345,00:07:37.343,00:00:00.998,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so pause filler as we're doing equal",,,,
00:07:37.343,00:07:41.514,00:00:04.171,,,,,,,,,,,"so I wonder if I can circle all right here",,,,
00:07:41.803,00:07:42.052,00:00:00.249,,,,,,,,,,,,"done huh",,,
00:07:42.312,00:07:51.431,00:00:09.119,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you're going to have to get rid of that six",,,,
00:07:51.970,00:07:54.654,00:00:02.684,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so you would have to add six right",,,
00:07:55.222,00:07:55.671,00:00:00.449,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:07:55.671,00:07:58.535,00:00:02.864,,,,,,,,,,,"so do you want to add six to both of those sides",,,,
00:08:00.770,00:08:01.239,00:00:00.469,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh gosh (laughter)",,,
00:08:01.239,00:08:02.556,00:00:01.317,,,,,,,,,,,"I know",,,,

00:08:04.741,00:08:06.537,00:00:01.796,,,,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler you add six",,,
00:08:06.537,00:08:08.792,00:00:02.255,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you get x equals nineteen",,,
00:08:09.929,00:08:10.348,00:00:00.419,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh gosh",,,
00:08:10.348,00:08:13.800,00:00:03.452,,,,,,,,,,,"so okay pause filler",,,,
00:08:14.758,00:08:17.372,00:00:02.614,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh that didn't work yeah",,,
00:08:17.602,00:08:21.084,00:00:03.482,,,,,,,,,,,"but do you know how to get to the next problem",,,,
00:08:21.313,00:08:21.832,00:00:00.519,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:08:21.832,00:08:26.551,00:00:04.719,,,,,,,,,,,,"we go onto the next page",,,
00:08:26.551,00:08:27.569,00:00:01.018,,,,,,,,,,,"oh (laughter) okay",,,,
00:08:27.569,00:08:29.894,00:00:02.325,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler okay for this one it's sort of the same thing",,,,
00:08:29.894,00:08:34.523,00:00:04.629,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to get pause filler or does the eight",,,,
00:08:34.523,00:08:39.941,00:00:05.418,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and that's a negative so you would have to add it",,,
00:08:39.941,00:08:53.261,00:00:13.320,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah just like the last one",,,,
00:08:53.380,00:08:57.361,00:00:03.981,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh gosh",,,
00:08:58.159,00:08:58.329,00:00:00.170,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,,

00:08:59.716,00:09:12.676,00:00:12.960,,,,,,,,,,,,"fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two",,,
00:09:13.874,00:09:14.792,00:00:00.918,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right next page right",,,
00:09:16.578,00:09:16.797,00:00:00.219,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,,,
00:09:16.797,00:09:17.765,00:00:00.968,,,,,,,,,,,"there we go (laughter)",,,,
00:09:17.924,00:09:20.958,00:00:03.034,,,,,,,,,,,"okay pause filler so this one is a lot like the other ones",,,,
00:09:20.958,00:09:23.592,00:00:02.634,,,,,,,,,,,"except for this one yeah you don't want to add it",,,,
00:09:23.592,00:09:25.258,00:00:01.666,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so you have to subtract",,,
00:09:26.136,00:09:32.412,00:00:06.276,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you would subtract eleven because it's a positive right",,,
00:09:32.541,00:09:32.910,00:00:00.369,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:09:33.389,00:09:35.155,00:00:01.766,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so minus eleven",,,
00:09:42.898,00:09:44.155,00:00:01.257,,,,,,,,,,,,"then those who cancel out",,,
00:09:44.155,00:09:45.971,00:00:01.816,,,,,,,,,,,,"so it would be k equals six",,,
00:09:46.400,00:09:46.719,00:00:00.319,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:09:48.425,00:09:49.004,00:00:00.579,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh gosh",,,
00:09:49.004,00:09:50.590,00:00:01.586,,,,,,,,,,,,"this is so messy",,,

00:09:50.620,00:10:00.797,00:00:10.177,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so this time we pause filler yeah only one term on the other side so yeah",,,,
00:10:00.797,00:10:03.481,00:00:02.684,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so you want to get rid of the forty-four",,,,
00:10:03.481,00:10:05.995,00:00:02.514,,,,,,,,,,,"so the coefficient of x is one so",,,,
00:10:06.584,00:10:12.720,00:00:06.136,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah pause filler so you want to get rid of the forty-four so the coefficient of x is one so",,,
00:10:12.720,00:10:13.099,00:00:00.379,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:10:14.835,00:10:17.000,00:00:02.165,,,,,,,,,,,"do you know how to do that",,,,
00:10:17.000,00:10:17.709,00:00:00.709,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah yeah yeah",,,
00:10:17.709,00:10:21.440,00:00:03.731,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you'd have to divide because it's multiplication",,,
00:10:21.440,00:10:22.518,00:00:01.078,,,,,,,,,,,,"then you do the opposites",,,
00:10:22.518,00:10:23.915,00:00:01.397,,,,,,,,,,,,"so divided by forty",,,
00:10:23.915,00:10:24.373,00:00:00.458,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:10:25.601,00:10:26.529,00:00:00.928,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's so weird",,,
00:10:26.529,00:10:30.200,00:00:03.671,,,,,,,,,,,,"because I have to like I have to take a moment to think now",,,
00:10:30.200,00:10:34.920,00:00:04.720,,,,,,,,,,,,"because I'm so accustomed in my class to using calculators like she lets s",,,
00:10:34.920,00:10:36.456,00:00:01.536,,,,,,,,,,,"I know yeah",,,,
00:10:36.456,00:10:37.534,00:00:01.078,,,,,,,,,,,,"so divide it",,,
00:10:37.534,00:10:40.337,00:00:02.803,,,,,,,,,,,"on personal calculators and I just pull it up",,,,
00:10:40.577,00:10:43.470,00:00:02.893,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah wait oh gosh",,,
00:10:43.470,00:10:48.329,00:00:04.859,,,,,,,,,,,,"is this what even is this then (laughter)",,,
00:10:53.338,00:11:02.287,00:00:08.949,,,,,,,,,,,,"ten x equals twenty-two divided two hundred and twenty divided by forty-four",,,
00:11:04.203,00:11:07.116,00:00:02.913,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I wonder if I could",,,,
00:11:07.615,00:11:09.770,00:00:02.155,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so that's like a forty-four on that side",,,,
00:11:09.960,00:11:10.668,00:00:00.708,,,,,,,,,,,"that was lovely",,,,
00:11:10.668,00:11:11.776,00:00:01.108,,,,,,,,,,,"okay I know what I mean",,,,
00:11:12.474,00:11:13.831,00:00:01.357,,,,,,,,,,,"and two hundred twenty",,,,
00:11:15.028,00:11:17.742,00:00:02.714,,,,,,,,,,,"see you can go I see like pause filler",,,,
00:11:19.059,00:11:19.857,00:00:00.798,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah yeah yeah",,,
00:11:19.857,00:11:22.950,00:00:03.093,,,,,,,,,,,"I just yeah okay how many times",,,,
00:11:22.950,00:11:26.452,00:00:03.502,,,,,,,,,,,"it's like about five five ten",,,,
00:11:26.452,00:11:28.827,00:00:02.375,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah that would make sense so",,,
00:11:28.827,00:11:30.254,00:00:01.427,,,,,,,,,,,"and maybe it's (inaudible) five",,,,
00:11:30.363,00:11:31.092,00:00:00.729,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah it",,,
00:11:35.322,00:11:38.615,00:00:03.293,,,,,,,,,,,"(inaudible) that was not how it's supposed to",,,,
00:11:38.615,00:11:41.947,00:00:03.332,,,,,,,,,,,,"it seems so embarrassing because it's just like we're so used to using calculators",,,
00:11:41.947,00:11:43.633,00:00:01.686,,,,,,,,,,,,"but it just yeah",,,
00:11:44.252,00:11:45.689,00:00:01.437,,,,,,,,,,,"okay let's see",,,,
00:11:45.729,00:11:47.375,00:00:01.646,,,,,,,,,,,"that's zero",,,,
00:11:48.013,00:11:51.436,00:00:03.423,,,,,,,,,,,"it's pause filler a two yeah a two",,,,
00:11:51.924,00:11:53.192,00:00:01.268,,,,,,,,,,,"four times that that's also",,,,
00:11:53.192,00:11:54.459,00:00:01.267,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah it's five",,,,

00:12:39.257,00:12:39.925,00:00:00.668,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"yeah so",,,,
00:12:39.925,00:12:46.251,00:00:06.326,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so now you add nine right",,,
00:12:46.500,00:12:47.199,00:00:00.699,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so (inaudible)",,,,
00:12:47.199,00:12:51.559,00:00:04.360,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you add nine to this",,,
00:12:51.559,00:12:59.601,00:00:08.042,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you're left with thirteen p equals fifty",,,
00:13:00.209,00:13:00.549,00:00:00.340,,,,,,,,,,,,"so",,,
00:13:02.813,00:13:08.620,00:00:05.807,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so then you want to give it to the thirteen",,,,
00:13:08.690,00:13:10.586,00:00:01.896,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you divide it by thirteen",,,
00:13:13.689,00:13:16.123,00:00:02.434,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait does the fraction pause filler",,,
00:13:18.218,00:13:21.850,00:00:03.632,,,,,,,,,,,,"does the fifty divided by thirteen equal out to a fraction",,,
00:13:22.529,00:13:23.816,00:00:01.287,,,,,,,,,,,"no I don't think it's simplified",,,,

00:13:33.294,00:13:35.848,00:00:02.554,,,,,,,,,,,"I mean like thirteen is like prawn numbers",,,,
00:13:35.848,00:13:38.063,00:00:02.215,,,,,,,,,,,"so it would not be that likely",,,,
00:13:38.323,00:13:41.645,00:00:03.322,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so with this one it's a little bit different",,,
00:13:41.645,00:13:46.694,00:00:05.049,,,,,,,,,,,,"but you just subtract ten from both sides",,,
00:13:47.741,00:13:47.981,00:00:00.240,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,,,
00:13:48.549,00:13:51.064,00:00:02.515,,,,,,,,,,,,"so twenty-four",,,
00:13:53.508,00:14:00.113,00:00:06.605,,,,,,,,,,,,"and pause filler so you're left with six x equals twenty-four",,,
00:14:00.113,00:14:01.610,00:00:01.497,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you divide by (laughter)",,,

00:14:05.371,00:14:07.486,00:00:02.115,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah a six",,,,

00:14:09.592,00:14:13.373,00:00:03.781,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then x equals four because twenty-four divided by six equals four",,,

00:14:26.254,00:14:30.604,00:00:04.350,,,,,,,,,,,,"with this one since that's a negative you add it right so",,,
00:14:31.113,00:14:31.572,00:00:00.459,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:14:40.871,00:14:41.519,00:00:00.648,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh okay",,,

00:14:58.850,00:14:59.668,00:00:00.818,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh my god",,,
00:15:00.286,00:15:04.487,00:00:04.201,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler and then divide that by fifteen",,,
00:15:07.390,00:15:09.037,00:00:01.647,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that would just be another",,,
00:15:09.675,00:15:10.254,00:00:00.579,,,,,,,,,,,"let's see",,,,
00:15:10.254,00:15:11.870,00:00:01.616,,,,,,,,,,,"where were we sixty-two (inaudible)",,,,
00:15:11.870,00:15:12.060,00:00:00.190,,,,,,,,,,,"nope",,,,
00:15:12.060,00:15:17.697,00:00:05.637,,,,,,,,,,,"I'd say that no you can't simplify",,,,
00:15:17.697,00:15:19.213,00:00:01.516,,,,,,,,,,,"it maybe maybe not",,,,
00:15:25.160,00:15:26.716,00:00:01.556,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah because yeah",,,,
00:15:26.716,00:15:27.325,00:00:00.609,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",,,
00:15:29.061,00:15:32.783,00:00:03.722,,,,,,,,,,,,"so for this one",,,
00:15:35.696,00:15:36.684,00:00:00.988,,,,,,,,,,,,"subtract",,,
00:15:37.382,00:15:38.011,00:00:00.629,,,,,,,,,,,"twelve",,,,
00:15:41.912,00:15:51.480,00:00:09.568,,,,,,,,,,,,"sorry it's like it takes a minute for it to show up",,,
00:15:52.408,00:15:55.531,00:00:03.123,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah real slow okay",,,,
00:15:56.449,00:16:09.499,00:00:13.050,,,,,,,,,,,"so yeah twenty-one",,,,
00:16:09.609,00:16:10.088,00:00:00.479,,,,,,,,,,,"that's right",,,,
00:16:10.178,00:16:13.809,00:00:03.631,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then that cancels out obviously",,,
00:16:13.959,00:16:14.448,00:00:00.489,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:16:14.787,00:16:15.725,00:00:00.938,,,,,,,,,,,,"so plus",,,
00:16:15.795,00:16:18.409,00:00:02.614,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh no that equals",,,
00:16:18.409,00:16:21.731,00:00:03.322,,,,,,,,,,,,"twenty-one equals seven x",,,
00:16:22.080,00:16:24.585,00:00:02.505,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then twenty-one is divisible by sevens",,,
00:16:24.585,00:16:28.895,00:00:04.310,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that's pause filler divisible by three",,,
00:16:28.895,00:16:32.158,00:00:03.263,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then pause filler x equals three",,,
00:16:33.435,00:16:34.343,00:00:00.908,,,,,,,,,,,"yup okay",,,,
00:16:36.687,00:16:38.693,00:00:02.006,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,"all right great",,,
00:16:38.832,00:16:39.012,00:00:00.180,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh",,,
00:16:39.012,00:16:40.808,00:00:01.796,,,,,,,,,,,,"so this is a different one",,,
00:16:41.407,00:16:46.575,00:00:05.168,,,,,,,,,,,,"so first you're going to get to pause filler you're going to do the variables first",,,
00:16:46.754,00:16:49.937,00:00:03.183,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you do the one that's like less right",,,
00:16:49.937,00:16:50.935,00:00:00.998,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you do the less",,,,
00:16:50.945,00:16:52.621,00:00:01.676,,,,,,,,,,,"because otherwise you'll have the negative p",,,,
00:16:52.621,00:16:53.749,00:00:01.128,,,,,,,,,,,"and that's not that fun",,,,
00:16:53.818,00:16:56.083,00:00:02.265,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so minus p",,,
00:16:56.083,00:16:57.660,00:00:01.577,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then minus p",,,
00:16:58.268,00:17:01.022,00:00:02.754,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you end up with fifteen equals",,,
00:17:01.391,00:17:01.980,00:00:00.589,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh gosh",,,
00:17:02.708,00:17:04.494,00:00:01.786,,,,,,,,,,,,"got it",,,
00:17:05.891,00:17:11.089,00:00:05.198,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler fifteen sorry pause filler fifteen equals two p plus twelve",,,
00:17:12.177,00:17:12.296,00:00:00.119,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:17:12.925,00:17:13.573,00:00:00.648,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then pause filler",,,
00:17:13.573,00:17:15.888,00:00:02.315,,,,,,,,,,,"it's just like the other problems",,,,
00:17:15.888,00:17:17.684,00:00:01.796,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah now you subtract twelve",,,
00:17:19.460,00:17:21.785,00:00:02.325,,,,,,,,,,,,"so three equals",,,
00:17:22.174,00:17:22.653,00:00:00.479,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh god",,,
00:17:24.319,00:17:27.532,00:00:03.213,,,,,,,,,,,,"two p no",,,
00:17:27.532,00:17:29.856,00:00:02.324,,,,,,,,,,,,"no you divide it by two",,,
00:17:29.856,00:17:32.999,00:00:03.143,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you end up with three halves",,,
00:17:35.105,00:17:35.803,00:00:00.698,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so",,,,
00:17:35.803,00:17:37.719,00:00:01.916,,,,,,,,,,,"because you can't simplify that anymore",,,,
00:17:37.719,00:17:46.259,00:00:08.540,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah all right",,,
00:17:46.259,00:17:53.243,00:00:06.984,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so for this one yeah you want to start off by having only one k",,,,
00:17:56.147,00:18:00.028,00:00:03.881,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you have to subtract that anyway",,,
00:18:00.966,00:18:04.508,00:00:03.542,,,,,,,,,,,,"subtract that from this",,,
00:18:04.508,00:18:06.134,00:00:01.626,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you would end up with negative ten",,,
00:18:06.134,00:18:08.409,00:00:02.275,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you leave the negative there equals",,,
00:18:08.409,00:18:09.087,00:00:00.678,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:18:10.115,00:18:17.538,00:00:07.423,,,,,,,,,,,,"seven k minus sixty-eight",,,
00:18:17.837,00:18:25.690,00:00:07.853,,,,,,,,,,,,"then plus ten on both sides",,,
00:18:25.690,00:18:25.749,00:00:00.059,,,,,,,,,,,"no",,,,
00:18:25.749,00:18:31.666,00:00:05.917,,,,,,,,,,,"actually you wouldn't want to do the plus ten because then you'll have seven k equals yeah so",,,,
00:18:31.666,00:18:33.352,00:00:01.686,,,,,,,,,,,,"you add sixty-eight",,,
00:18:33.632,00:18:33.841,00:00:00.209,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,,,
00:18:34.779,00:18:36.884,00:00:02.105,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm just going to write over it you know what",,,
00:18:37.243,00:18:40.316,00:00:03.073,,,,,,,,,,,,"so plus sixty-eight",,,
00:18:40.506,00:18:42.152,00:00:01.646,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that cancels out",,,
00:18:42.491,00:18:43.060,00:00:00.569,,,,,,,,,,,,"then",,,
00:18:45.644,00:18:46.861,00:00:01.217,,,,,,,,,,,,"seventy-eight",,,
00:18:49.655,00:18:54.364,00:00:04.709,,,,,,,,,,,,"equals seven k",,,
00:18:54.364,00:18:58.036,00:00:03.672,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait is seventy-eight divided by seven divisible by seven I mean",,,
00:18:58.036,00:19:00.830,00:00:02.794,,,,,,,,,,,"wait no I think you messed up because that's a negative ten",,,,
00:19:00.830,00:19:02.915,00:00:02.085,,,,,,,,,,,"so it wouldn't be ten plus sixty",,,,
00:19:02.915,00:19:06.846,00:00:03.931,,,,,,,,,,,"it would be ten minus it would be sixty-eight minus ten",,,,
00:19:07.036,00:19:07.934,00:00:00.898,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh",,,
00:19:08.083,00:19:09.400,00:00:01.317,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so",,,,
00:19:09.400,00:19:10.617,00:00:01.217,,,,,,,,,,,,"it would be fifty-eight",,,
00:19:12.094,00:19:14.209,00:00:02.115,,,,,,,,,,,,"so fifty-eight equals seven k",,,
00:19:14.209,00:19:17.592,00:00:03.383,,,,,,,,,,,,"so is fifty-eight divisible by a seven",,,
00:19:17.592,00:19:19.467,00:00:01.875,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can't talk I'm sorry pause filler",,,
00:19:19.467,00:19:22.620,00:00:03.153,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I don't think though because I don't remember that",,,,
00:19:22.620,00:19:25.224,00:00:02.604,,,,,,,,,,,"fifty-six fifty-eight isn't",,,,
00:19:25.494,00:19:26.202,00:00:00.708,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,"okay great",,,
00:19:27.120,00:19:30.742,00:00:03.622,,,,,,,,,,,"so you can just here we go",,,,
00:19:31.350,00:19:34.294,00:00:02.944,,,,,,,,,,,,"so k equals fifty-eight",,,
00:19:35.012,00:19:35.381,00:00:00.369,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:19:35.381,00:19:42.994,00:00:07.613,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right next stop",,,
00:19:43.173,00:19:47.184,00:00:04.011,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler okay to solve this problem you have to delete all the variables",,,,
00:19:50.507,00:19:51.954,00:00:01.447,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait so it said come out",,,
00:19:51.954,00:19:52.812,00:00:00.858,,,,,,,,,,,,"and get us",,,
00:19:53.041,00:19:53.370,00:00:00.329,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:19:53.789,00:19:56.812,00:00:03.023,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler do you know where they are",,,,
00:19:58.449,00:20:00.235,00:00:01.786,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I don't but",,,
00:20:00.235,00:20:03.398,00:00:03.163,,,,,,,,,,,"okay maybe they're outside",,,,
00:20:03.398,00:20:04.974,00:00:01.576,,,,,,,,,,,"I'll look and you will",,,,
00:20:05.094,00:20:06.281,00:00:01.187,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right I'll be right back",,,
00:20:06.560,00:20:31.184,00:00:24.624,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay there's a couple more these",,
00:20:31.274,00:20:34.627,00:00:03.353,,,,,,,,,,,,,"don't have pause filler instructions for her",,
00:20:35.854,00:20:37.001,00:00:01.147,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so go keep going",,
00:20:37.141,00:20:41.032,00:00:03.891,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you've unlocked the free bonus round",,
00:20:41.032,00:20:42.828,00:00:01.796,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right great",,,
00:20:42.828,00:20:44.474,00:00:01.646,,,,,,,,,,,,"so she's tutoring me",,,
00:20:44.474,00:20:44.744,00:00:00.270,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yes",,
00:20:44.744,00:20:45.193,00:00:00.449,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",,,
00:20:45.252,00:20:47.218,00:00:01.966,,,,,,,,,,,"okay yeah okay (laughter)",,,,
00:20:47.218,00:20:51.378,00:00:04.160,,,,,,,,,,,"so yeah you want to make sure one side has variables and one side doesn't",,,,
00:20:51.498,00:20:55.599,00:00:04.101,,,,,,,,,,,"so which one do you want to start with",,,,
00:20:56.088,00:20:58.393,00:00:02.305,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler let's just start with the variables",,,
00:20:58.393,00:21:01.585,00:00:03.192,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you subtract r",,,
00:21:02.134,00:21:06.354,00:00:04.220,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you would just end up with r  because you don't say one r because it's all yeah",,,
00:21:06.354,00:21:06.674,00:00:00.320,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:21:06.793,00:21:11.533,00:00:04.740,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you keep the negative thirty-three equals",,,
00:21:15.124,00:21:17.579,00:00:02.455,,,,,,,,,,,,"r minus fifteen",,,
00:21:19.874,00:21:25.860,00:00:05.986,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you add fifteen to both sides right",,,
00:21:27.257,00:21:27.656,00:00:00.399,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,,,
00:21:31.507,00:21:31.866,00:00:00.359,,,,,,,,,,,,"so",,,
00:21:32.076,00:21:39.210,00:00:07.134,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you would that would be",,,,
00:21:39.320,00:21:42.752,00:00:03.432,,,,,,,,,,,,"so negative three plus negative thirty-three plus fifteen",,,
00:21:43.640,00:21:44.508,00:00:00.868,,,,,,,,,,,"is",,,,
00:21:45.685,00:21:47.162,00:00:01.477,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler that's a negative three",,,,
00:21:47.162,00:21:55.443,00:00:08.281,,,,,,,,,,,"I just want to",,,,
00:21:55.952,00:21:58.855,00:00:02.903,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler that would be a negative twelve I'm pretty sure",,,,
00:22:05.101,00:22:08.344,00:00:03.243,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh wait don't you always want to end up with a variable on the left side",,,
00:22:09.172,00:22:11.885,00:00:02.713,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I'm pretty sure that doesn't matter",,,,
00:22:11.885,00:22:13.831,00:00:01.946,,,,,,,,,,,"but yeah if you want to write that around",,,,
00:22:13.831,00:22:15.378,00:00:01.547,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",,,
00:22:15.378,00:22:15.906,00:00:00.528,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,,
00:22:17.543,00:22:21.154,00:00:03.611,,,,,,,,,,,,"negative forty-two plus u equals eight plus four u so",,,
00:22:22.352,00:22:25.205,00:00:02.853,,,,,,,,,,,"so want to get for the variable again",,,,
00:22:25.894,00:22:28.727,00:00:02.833,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you subtract u from both sides",,,
00:22:28.727,00:22:34.225,00:00:05.498,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you'd end up with negative forty-two equals eight",,,
00:22:37.238,00:22:40.550,00:00:03.312,,,,,,,,,,,,"plus three u now",,,
00:22:41.518,00:22:42.187,00:00:00.669,,,,,,,,,,,,"so",,,
00:22:42.626,00:22:44.801,00:00:02.175,,,,,,,,,,,"now you want to get rid of that eight",,,,
00:22:46.537,00:22:48.323,00:00:01.786,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"oh that's fun underlining stuff (laughter)",,,,
00:22:50.977,00:22:54.080,00:00:03.103,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you subtract eight from this",,,
00:22:54.439,00:23:00.305,00:00:05.866,,,,,,,,,,,,"so since it's a negative you would base yeah I'm just thinking of",,,
00:23:01.263,00:23:03.139,00:00:01.876,,,,,,,,,,,"yes so it would still be a negative",,,,
00:23:03.139,00:23:05.683,00:00:02.544,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh so yeah it would still be a negative",,,
00:23:05.683,00:23:07.798,00:00:02.115,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you're basically just adding it",,,
00:23:07.798,00:23:10.123,00:00:02.325,,,,,,,,,,,,"but it's a negative kind of",,,
00:23:10.213,00:23:10.582,00:00:00.369,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:23:10.722,00:23:17.945,00:00:07.223,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah so you would obviously end up with negative fifty equals three u",,,
00:23:17.945,00:23:21.667,00:00:03.722,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then fifty isn't divisible by three",,,
00:23:22.226,00:23:25.289,00:00:03.063,,,,,,,,,,,,"so just divide it by three",,,
00:23:25.428,00:23:31.285,00:00:05.857,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then u equals oh fifty over three",,,
00:23:31.864,00:23:32.881,00:00:01.017,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",,,
00:23:34.109,00:23:34.627,00:00:00.518,,,,,,,,,,,,"so",,,
00:23:36.543,00:23:39.915,00:00:03.372,,,,,,,,,,,"I'll pick numbers okay",,,,
00:23:41.412,00:23:49.334,00:00:07.922,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you're just going to add no subtract n",,,
00:23:49.334,00:23:52.327,00:00:02.993,,,,,,,,,,,,"just forget I put that sign there",,,
00:23:53.325,00:23:55.251,00:00:01.926,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler subtract n from both sides",,,
00:23:55.939,00:24:08.780,00:00:12.841,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what you end up with one of six equals ninety-nine n plus seven",,,
00:24:10.137,00:24:12.900,00:00:02.763,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then u",,,
00:24:13.569,00:24:15.554,00:00:01.985,,,,,,,,,,,,"do you subtract seven next",,,
00:24:16.243,00:24:18.208,00:00:01.965,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah you want to subtract the seven",,,,
00:24:18.588,00:24:22.748,00:00:04.160,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you that you end up with ninety-nine on this side also",,,
00:24:22.748,00:24:23.836,00:00:01.088,,,,,,,,,,,,"so ninety-nine equals",,,
00:24:23.836,00:24:24.255,00:00:00.419,,,,,,,,,,,"that would be easy",,,,
00:24:24.474,00:24:25.143,00:00:00.669,,,,,,,,,,,,"ninety-nine",,,
00:24:25.143,00:24:28.475,00:00:03.332,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then obviously that divides into one",,,
00:24:28.475,00:24:31.339,00:00:02.864,,,,,,,,,,,,"so n equals one",,,
00:24:31.648,00:24:33.184,00:00:01.536,,,,,,,,,,,,"that was an easy problem",,,
00:24:33.424,00:24:35.379,00:00:01.955,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that (inaudible) numbers",,,,
00:24:35.459,00:24:36.567,00:00:01.108,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",,,
00:24:37.674,00:24:38.432,00:00:00.758,,,,,,,,,,,,"so",,,

00:24:41.066,00:24:42.723,00:00:01.657,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,"fifty-five all right great",,,
00:24:42.723,00:24:46.414,00:00:03.691,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you subtract g this time because",,,
00:24:46.754,00:24:52.770,00:00:06.016,,,,,,,,,,,"it's so that will less oh I want to try with g",,,,
00:24:54.007,00:24:57.170,00:00:03.163,,,,,,,,,,,"there we go",,,,
00:24:58.088,00:24:59.345,00:00:01.257,,,,,,,,,,,,"fifty-five",,,

00:25:08.514,00:25:12.166,00:00:03.652,,,,,,,,,,,,"so fifty-five minus",,,
00:25:16.825,00:25:24.049,00:00:07.224,,,,,,,,,,,,"no like I'm sorry fifty-five equals seven plus twelve g",,,
00:25:24.368,00:25:24.607,00:00:00.239,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,,,
00:25:25.725,00:25:26.982,00:00:01.257,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then",,,
00:25:29.037,00:25:29.806,00:00:00.769,,,,,,,,,,,,"plus",,,
00:25:31.582,00:25:33.198,00:00:01.616,,,,,,,,,,,,"no it's minus seven right",,,
00:25:33.368,00:25:35.094,00:00:01.726,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you want as good as positive",,,,
00:25:35.712,00:25:36.780,00:00:01.068,,,,,,,,,,,,"so minus seven",,,

00:25:44.732,00:25:49.531,00:00:04.799,,,,,,,,,,,"(inaudible) oh yeah because I want to subtract the two",,,,
00:25:50.169,00:25:55.996,00:00:05.827,,,,,,,,,,,,"so forty-eight is pause filler that's twelve times four right",,,
00:25:57.483,00:25:57.762,00:00:00.279,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah",,,,
00:25:57.762,00:26:00.466,00:00:02.704,,,,,,,,,,,"that's what so you'd want to divide the twelve",,,,
00:26:00.705,00:26:04.666,00:00:03.961,,,,,,,,,,,,"so g equals four great",,,
00:26:05.884,00:26:11.451,00:00:05.567,,,,,,,,,,,"and okay and",,,,
00:26:11.451,00:26:18.545,00:00:07.094,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so you would want to start out by subtracting the n",,,

00:36:29.387,00:36:36.261,00:00:06.874,,,,,,,,,,,"that was a thirteen (laughter) x equals twenty-five here we go",,,,
00:36:36.291,00:36:41.729,00:00:05.438,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,"all right great",,,
00:36:41.828,00:36:42.916,00:00:01.088,,,,,,,,,,,"let me see",,,,
00:36:43.066,00:36:45.660,00:00:02.594,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler you change it do you know how to change it",,,,
00:36:45.660,00:36:46.797,00:00:01.137,,,,,,,,,,,"or should I change it for you",,,,
00:36:46.797,00:36:48.413,00:00:01.616,,,,,,,,,,,"oh this is the page I see okay",,,,
00:36:50.110,00:36:51.935,00:00:01.825,,,,,,,,,,,,"so this is a negative",,,
00:36:51.935,00:36:53.612,00:00:01.677,,,,,,,,,,,,"so we start off by adding",,,
00:36:54.819,00:36:56.814,00:00:01.995,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so adding y",,,,
00:36:57.094,00:36:57.612,00:00:00.518,,,,,,,,,,,"here we go",,,,
00:36:58.231,00:36:59.079,00:00:00.848,,,,,,,,,,,"wait no not the y",,,,
00:36:59.079,00:37:00.177,00:00:01.098,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh not the y",,,
00:37:00.177,00:37:03.389,00:00:03.212,,,,,,,,,,,"but you know I guess you could do that right yeah",,,,
00:37:04.856,00:37:08.598,00:00:03.742,,,,,,,,,,,,"no no you shouldn't do that",,,
00:37:08.598,00:37:09.326,00:00:00.728,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait let's go back",,,
00:37:09.326,00:37:09.964,00:00:00.638,,,,,,,,,,,,"let's go back",,,
00:37:10.463,00:37:11.641,00:00:01.178,,,,,,,,,,,,"that was wrong (laughter)",,,
00:37:12.419,00:37:17.497,00:00:05.078,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you want to start off by subtracting eighteen from both sides",,,
00:37:18.136,00:37:27.784,00:00:09.648,,,,,,,,,,,"okay okay negative y equals five",,,,
00:37:28.472,00:37:29.171,00:00:00.699,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,"yeah great",,,
00:37:29.171,00:37:31.835,00:00:02.664,,,,,,,,,,,,"so just remember that pause filler there's a negative in front of it",,,
00:37:31.835,00:37:33.521,00:00:01.686,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that means that there's a negative one",,,
00:37:34.100,00:37:36.394,00:00:02.294,,,,,,,,,,,,"so divide that by negative one",,,
00:37:36.394,00:37:41.662,00:00:05.268,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you'll get your answer",,,
00:37:41.662,00:37:45.534,00:00:03.872,,,,,,,,,,,"okay y equals negative five",,,,
00:37:46.122,00:37:46.591,00:00:00.469,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",,,
00:37:46.591,00:37:47.868,00:00:01.277,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",,,
00:37:49.674,00:37:52.348,00:00:02.674,,,,,,,,,,,,"this one is a little bit different pause filler",,,
00:37:52.917,00:37:56.848,00:00:03.931,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what do you think you're going to start off by doing",,,
00:37:56.848,00:38:03.802,00:00:06.954,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so for this one we want since there's pause filler I guess there's two ks",,,,
00:38:03.802,00:38:08.372,00:00:04.570,,,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler you would want to get rid of one of the k",,,,
00:38:08.551,00:38:10.447,00:00:01.896,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you should start off with the variable",,,
00:38:11.295,00:38:14.000,00:00:02.705,,,,,,,,,,,"so we're going to add a k so that it cancels out the other k",,,,
00:38:14.000,00:38:16.000,00:00:02.000,,,,,,,,,,,"so we're going to add a k so that it cancels out the other k","(sfx)",,,
00:38:16.000,00:38:16.254,00:00:00.254,,,,,,,,,,,"so we're going to add a k so that it cancels out the other k",,,,
00:38:17.900,00:38:20.285,00:00:02.385,,,,,,,,,,,"are you okay",,,,
00:38:21.272,00:38:22.879,00:00:01.607,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I'm okay",,,
00:38:22.879,00:38:23.338,00:00:00.459,,,,,,,,,,,,"thank you",,,
00:38:23.996,00:38:29.943,00:00:05.947,,,,,,,,,,,"so we have negative fourteen equals thirty-six plus two k",,,,
00:38:29.943,00:38:32.417,00:00:02.474,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,"all right great",,,
00:38:32.417,00:38:33.774,00:00:01.357,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you end up with two k",,,
00:38:34.233,00:38:41.367,00:00:07.134,,,,,,,,,,,,"so now since pause filler this is a negative fourteen",,,
00:38:41.576,00:38:43.861,00:00:02.285,,,,,,,,,,,,"what are you going to need though",,,
00:38:43.861,00:38:48.979,00:00:05.118,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm going to add it so (inaudible)",,,,
00:38:48.979,00:38:54.018,00:00:05.039,,,,,,,,,,,,"well you would be doing it to the thirty-six remember because that's alone on the other side",,,
00:38:55.145,00:38:58.139,00:00:02.994,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah but you also want to do it to both sides",,,,
00:38:58.488,00:39:00.403,00:00:01.915,,,,,,,,,,,"so I guess",,,,
00:39:00.403,00:39:01.491,00:00:01.088,,,,,,,,,,,,"I know but would you",,,
00:39:01.491,00:39:02.808,00:00:01.317,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah oh that oh oh",,,,
00:39:02.808,00:39:05.671,00:00:02.863,,,,,,,,,,,,"you would want to be subtracting thirty-six",,,
00:39:11.019,00:39:14.342,00:00:03.323,,,,,,,,,,,"(laughter) okay I did not see it",,,,
00:39:14.342,00:39:14.990,00:00:00.648,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's okay",,,
00:39:14.990,00:39:16.726,00:00:01.736,,,,,,,,,,,,"it was my fault",,,
00:39:17.644,00:39:25.267,00:00:07.623,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so hurry up pause filler",,,,
00:39:26.185,00:39:29.517,00:00:03.332,,,,,,,,,,,"so now you want to subtract with thirty-six",,,,
00:39:32.151,00:39:35.673,00:00:03.522,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah thirty-six okay",,,,
00:39:36.541,00:39:43.286,00:00:06.745,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you get pause filler negative fifty equals two k",,,,
00:39:43.934,00:39:49.382,00:00:05.448,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so then you would want to divide by two on both sides",,,
00:39:52.804,00:39:56.925,00:00:04.121,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah equals negative twenty-five",,,,
00:39:58.322,00:40:01.973,00:00:03.651,,,,,,,,,,,"and we're good",,,,
00:40:02.692,00:40:03.181,00:00:00.489,,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,,
00:40:03.181,00:40:13.058,00:00:09.877,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so pause filler for this one you can do you should do the variable first always",,,
00:40:13.058,00:40:28.773,00:00:15.715,,,,,,,,,,,,"but you should start off by adding b on this side because sorry I just wrote over that pause filler you should start off by adding b because even though they both look the same that pause filler is worth less",,,
00:40:28.773,00:40:31.985,00:00:03.212,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you should always add and subtract the one that",,,
00:40:32.783,00:40:43.080,00:00:10.297,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so add b here and like the other following get seventeen thirteen plus two b",,,,
00:40:43.080,00:40:43.948,00:00:00.868,,,,,,,,,,,"and okay",,,,
00:40:44.866,00:40:48.987,00:00:04.121,,,,,,,,,,,"so now we need to make sure the b is on only one side",,,,
00:40:49.126,00:40:51.750,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,,,"and to do that you have to subtract the thirteen",,,,
00:40:52.090,00:40:52.409,00:00:00.319,,,,,,,,,,,,"right",,,
00:40:53.197,00:40:54.245,00:00:01.048,,,,,,,,,,,"not the seventeen",,,,
00:40:55.442,00:40:59.742,00:00:04.300,,,,,,,,,,,"and you get four equals two b",,,,
00:40:59.742,00:41:03.434,00:00:03.692,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you want to divide the two divide the two",,,,
00:41:03.933,00:41:06.577,00:00:02.644,,,,,,,,,,,"and you get two equals three",,,,
00:41:06.946,00:41:08.602,00:00:01.656,,,,,,,,,,,"and b equals two",,,,
00:41:09.310,00:41:09.710,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,"here we go",,,,
00:41:09.710,00:41:14.748,00:00:05.038,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so this one is a little bit easier",,,
00:41:14.748,00:41:16.344,00:00:01.596,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you're multiplying",,,
00:41:16.344,00:41:20.096,00:00:03.752,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what are you going to do to solve the equation",,,
00:41:20.595,00:41:23.259,00:00:02.664,,,,,,,,,,,"so this one you want to measure g alone",,,,

00:42:17.745,00:42:22.494,00:00:04.749,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you would have to pause filler divide by negative eight in both sides",,,

00:43:22.897,00:43:31.846,00:00:08.949,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay so pause filler now we got to subtract okay one hundred seven sixty-five is two like",,,,
00:43:31.846,00:43:35.388,00:00:03.542,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm going to say that's forty-two",,,,
00:43:37.304,00:43:44.897,00:00:07.593,,,,,,,,,,,"so forty-two equals negative fourteen x",,,,

00:43:48.249,00:43:54.575,00:00:06.326,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so and how we will want to pause filler divide by negative fourteen",,,,

00:44:00.142,00:44:08.543,00:00:08.401,,,,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler is ninety-two divided by negative I can't talk is ninety-two divided by divisible by negative fourteen",,,

00:44:29.236,00:44:33.357,00:00:04.121,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so pause filler this has bigger numbers in it",,,
00:44:33.357,00:44:37.228,00:00:03.871,,,,,,,,,,,,"but you would start off by adding what number",,,
00:44:38.076,00:44:38.715,00:00:00.639,,,,,,,,,,,"forty-one",,,,
00:44:38.715,00:44:38.904,00:00:00.189,,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,,

00:44:51.386,00:44:59.956,00:00:08.570,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yes so that would be seventy-five equals negative nine k divided by the negative nine",,,,
00:45:00.705,00:45:04.945,00:00:04.240,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you just want to make that equal on both sides",,,
00:45:09.355,00:45:14.513,00:00:05.158,,,,,,,,,,,"would you say seventy-five divided by negative nine",,,,
00:45:15.172,00:45:15.671,00:00:00.499,,,,,,,,,,,"here we go",,,,

00:45:22.305,00:45:26.925,00:00:04.620,,,,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler you would have to start off by adding p to both sides",,,
00:45:26.925,00:45:29.110,00:00:02.185,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what would you add it to on the other side",,,
00:45:29.499,00:45:32.442,00:00:02.943,,,,,,,,,,,"so I guess you want to so that would be nine p",,,,
00:45:32.752,00:45:34.428,00:00:01.676,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to add the p yeah",,,,
00:45:35.146,00:45:38.958,00:00:03.812,,,,,,,,,,,"so if you do it to both sides we got the negative fifty-two here",,,,
00:45:39.317,00:45:41.372,00:00:02.055,,,,,,,,,,,"we got the nine p over here",,,,
00:45:41.372,00:45:47.169,00:00:05.797,,,,,,,,,,,"we got the negative sixteen which we need to now add so that",,,,
00:45:47.239,00:45:51.519,00:00:04.280,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah just remember that you always have to keep that negative there because that's important",,,
00:45:54.253,00:46:01.107,00:00:06.854,,,,,,,,,,,"so it would be fifty-two minus sixteen which happens to be fourteen that would be forty",,,,
00:46:01.377,00:46:06.904,00:00:05.527,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm pretty sure that would be thirty-six",,,,
00:46:07.104,00:46:07.373,00:00:00.269,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:46:07.732,00:46:13.329,00:00:05.597,,,,,,,,,,,"that seems like (inaudible) okay thirty-six equals nine p",,,,
00:46:16.602,00:46:19.545,00:00:02.943,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler okay so then we want to divide it by nine",,,,
00:46:19.545,00:46:22.359,00:00:02.814,,,,,,,,,,,"and we get pause filler",,,,
00:46:22.359,00:46:22.509,00:00:00.150,,,,,,,,,,,,"four",,,
