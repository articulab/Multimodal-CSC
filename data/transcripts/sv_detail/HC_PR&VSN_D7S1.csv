00:10:06.200,00:10:11.700,00:00:05.500,,,,,,,,,,"so all right add six to each side",,,
00:10:11.700,00:10:20.700,00:00:09.000,,,,,,,,,,"and that's x equals",,,
00:10:21.900,00:10:24.400,00:00:02.500,,,,,,,,,,"and then three plus six nineteen",,,
00:10:25.700,00:10:26.500,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,"oh okay",,,
00:10:28.100,00:10:32.600,00:00:04.500,,,,,,,,,,"so it's probably right I guess because x equals nineteen now",,,
00:10:32.600,00:10:35.500,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I guess so",,
00:10:35.900,00:10:38.900,00:00:03.000,,,,,,,,,,"yeah all right how do you go to the next one",,,
00:10:39.300,00:10:40.400,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,"do you know",,,
00:10:40.600,00:10:41.900,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,"yes",,

00:10:46.200,00:10:47.800,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,,"so now it's your turn",,
00:10:48.600,00:10:49.400,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,
00:10:51.500,00:10:58.600,00:00:07.100,,,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler I guess I do seven no eleven",,
00:11:00.300,00:11:03.500,00:00:03.200,,,,,,,,,,,"plus seventeen",,
00:11:03.600,00:11:06.100,00:00:02.500,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"man my handwriting is horrible",,
00:11:06.600,00:11:08.400,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so",,
00:11:09.900,00:11:13.200,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,,"and I do eleven plus k",,
00:11:13.700,00:11:16.800,00:00:03.100,,,,,,,,,,,"so that cancels out k so",,
00:11:16.900,00:11:18.500,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,"like add eleven each side",,,
00:11:19.000,00:11:23.900,00:00:04.900,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so then it's pretty much that's twenty-eight",,
00:11:24.900,00:11:26.400,00:00:01.500,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and then plus",,,
00:11:28.000,00:11:30.800,00:00:02.800,,,,,,,,,,"wait yeah or subtract",,,
00:11:30.800,00:11:34.700,00:00:03.900,,,,,,,,,,"are you subtracting eleven because that would cancel out eleven then",,,
00:11:36.600,00:11:41.500,00:00:04.900,,,,,,,,,,"if you subtract it eleven because then like then that would be zero",,,
00:11:41.500,00:11:43.100,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,"and you can just like go like that",,,
00:11:43.700,00:11:47.500,00:00:03.800,,,,,,,,,,"and then that would be seven wait no that would be six",,,
00:11:47.500,00:11:50.400,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,"(laughter) you got it",,,
00:11:50.500,00:11:50.800,00:00:00.300,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:11:50.800,00:11:51.900,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,"I think so yeah",,,
00:11:52.400,00:11:54.200,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,"maybe maybe not",,
00:11:54.700,00:11:55.900,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,,"well I have no idea",,
00:11:55.900,00:12:00.800,00:00:04.900,,,,,,,,,,"okay let's start like let's start fresh I guess",,,
00:12:01.300,00:12:04.600,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,"like here okay",,,
00:12:04.800,00:12:06.900,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so",,
00:12:08.800,00:12:11.100,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,"let's subtract the eleven from each side",,,
00:12:12.100,00:12:18.200,00:00:06.100,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so seventeen minus eleven",,
00:12:18.200,00:12:22.900,00:00:04.700,,,,,,,,,,,"and k minus eleven",,
00:12:22.900,00:12:24.400,00:00:01.500,,,,,,,,,,,"if I did equals eleven",,
00:12:24.400,00:12:26.100,00:00:01.700,,,,,,,,,,,"I have no idea",,
00:12:26.100,00:12:30.800,00:00:04.700,,,,,,,,,,"I just like scratch out the one",,,
00:12:30.800,00:12:34.200,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,"or did you like or you do eleven minus eleven",,,
00:12:34.200,00:12:35.400,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,"and seventeen minus eleven",,,
00:12:35.400,00:12:39.700,00:00:04.300,,,,,,,,,,"and they like (inaudible) I don't know",,,
00:12:40.700,00:12:46.500,00:00:05.800,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah pause filler well k isn't going anywhere because it's not a number necessarily so",,
00:12:47.200,00:12:48.800,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,"so then we can just cancel out the eleven then",,,
00:12:48.800,00:12:50.200,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,"and would just be a k alone",,,
00:12:50.500,00:12:53.800,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah it's hardly like what I'm doing",,
00:12:54.200,00:12:56.600,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,"then it could be yeah",,,
00:12:56.600,00:13:01.600,00:00:05.000,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"okay don't judge I have no idea what that is it looks like a fish",,
00:13:01.600,00:13:06.600,00:00:05.000,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so then seventeen minus eleven would be six",,
00:13:06.600,00:13:08.500,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,"six yeah",,,
00:13:10.000,00:13:12.800,00:00:02.800,,,,,,,,,,"so then six equals k oh",,,
00:13:13.300,00:13:14.200,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,"k equals six",,
00:13:14.900,00:13:15.200,00:00:00.300,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:13:15.900,00:13:16.900,00:00:01.000,,,,,,,,,,,"we did it",,

00:13:18.400,00:13:22.100,00:00:03.700,,,,,,,,,,"okay so how do you go to the next one",,,
00:13:22.300,00:13:28.300,00:00:06.000,,,,,,,,,,,"and then nope",,
00:13:28.300,00:13:32.300,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,,"(sfx) okay",,
00:13:32.600,00:13:37.700,00:00:05.100,,,,,,,,,,,"then add okay s I know how to do this one",,
00:13:37.700,00:13:46.600,00:00:08.900,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so what you'll have to do is you have to",,
00:13:46.900,00:13:51.100,00:00:04.200,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah add forty-four plus two",,
00:13:51.100,00:13:55.300,00:00:04.200,,,,,,,,,,,"hundred twenty",,
00:13:55.300,00:13:57.600,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,"we add it",,,

00:13:58.700,00:13:59.700,00:00:01.000,,,,,,,,,,"or divide it",,,
00:13:59.700,00:14:01.000,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,"like two hundred twenty divided forty-four",,,

00:20:35.400,00:20:41.100,00:00:05.700,,,,,,,,,,,"no what you want to do is you want to add nine plus negative nine which wait no",,
00:20:41.100,00:20:42.600,00:00:01.500,,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah because (inaudible) yeah",,,
00:20:42.600,00:20:44.700,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,"and then you could like cross that",,,
00:20:44.700,00:20:46.200,00:00:01.500,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah which would equal nine so",,
00:20:46.200,00:20:48.500,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,"well wait negative nine plus nine",,,
00:20:48.700,00:20:49.300,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,

00:21:24.100,00:21:28.800,00:00:04.700,,,,,,,,,,,"so what you want to do is you want to pause filler make that nine a positive",,
00:21:29.500,00:21:30.700,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,"a positive so",,,
00:21:31.100,00:21:34.400,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,,"yes so positive nine negative",,
00:21:34.600,00:21:37.396,00:00:02.796,,,,,,,,,,"so add eighteen and then",,,
00:21:37.396,00:21:37.400,00:00:00.004,"TRC",,,,,,,,,"so add eighteen and then",,,

00:21:52.500,00:21:55.100,00:00:02.600,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"that's because I wrote on it",,,

00:21:56.200,00:21:56.700,00:00:00.500,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"oh gosh",,,
00:21:58.500,00:21:59.400,00:00:00.900,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"just like undo it",,,
00:22:01.200,00:22:03.000,00:00:01.800,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"there we are okay",,,
00:22:03.100,00:22:03.900,00:00:00.800,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"ah",,
00:22:04.100,00:22:09.900,00:00:05.800,,,,,,,,,,"so are we trying to so how do you get the negative nine to a nine a positive",,,
00:22:10.500,00:22:13.600,00:00:03.100,,,,,,,,,,"so you add eighteen wait because that would get you there",,,
00:22:13.600,00:22:18.700,00:00:05.100,,,,,,,,,,,"no you have to keep the nine",,
00:22:18.700,00:22:20.800,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,"so just do nine plus thirteen",,
00:22:21.300,00:22:21.700,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,"negative nine",,,
00:22:22.100,00:22:23.400,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,"no positive nine",,
00:22:23.700,00:22:25.200,00:00:01.500,,,,,,,,,,"but this is a negative nine",,,
00:22:25.200,00:22:25.600,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,"what do you mean",,,
00:22:25.600,00:22:29.600,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah just I think don't you add it",,
00:22:29.800,00:22:33.600,00:00:03.800,,,,,,,,,,"I think you add nine because then that will cancel out like positive and",,,
00:22:33.600,00:22:34.100,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah add it",,
00:22:34.100,00:22:36.100,00:00:02.000,,,,,,,,,,"so then that would be zero and so then",,,
00:22:37.500,00:22:38.100,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,,"no really",,
00:22:38.500,00:22:44.300,00:00:05.800,,,,,,,,,,"yeah because if you add negative nine and then a positive nine like they cancel out",,,
00:22:44.300,00:22:46.800,00:00:02.500,,,,,,,,,,"and just equal zero I think",,,
00:22:47.700,00:22:50.000,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,,"maybe well I know so",,
00:22:50.000,00:22:52.000,00:00:02.000,,,,,,,,,,"(inaudible) and then you add listen",,,
00:22:52.000,00:22:54.900,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,"and then if you do one thing to one side you have to do it to the other",,,
00:22:54.900,00:22:56.700,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,"so you have to add nine to the side I think",,,
00:22:59.500,00:23:03.000,00:00:03.500,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you have to add nine to both sides",,
00:23:03.000,00:23:03.500,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:23:03.800,00:23:10.900,00:00:07.100,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you get the pause filler variable and the number together",,
00:23:11.100,00:23:13.100,00:00:02.000,,,,,,,,,,,"and then it has one number on the other side",,
00:23:13.900,00:23:16.900,00:00:03.000,,,,,,,,,,"so this is fifty and then this is",,,
00:23:16.900,00:23:17.000,00:00:00.100,,,,,,,"UL",,,,"good",,
00:23:17.000,00:23:18.600,00:00:01.600,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"oh my gosh",,

00:23:19.800,00:23:20.500,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,,"I get it",,
00:23:20.500,00:23:25.200,00:00:04.700,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so what you want to do is so you cancel out that nine",,
00:23:25.200,00:23:29.200,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you add that nine where you got it",,
00:23:29.200,00:23:30.400,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,"so then forty-nine right",,,
00:23:30.400,00:23:34.300,00:00:03.900,,,,,,,,,,,"no you add it to thirteen and forty-one",,
00:23:34.800,00:23:38.700,00:00:03.900,,,,,,,,,,"wait so you add the nine to the thirteen and then negative nine and forty-one",,,
00:23:38.800,00:23:39.200,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:23:39.900,00:23:40.600,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,
00:23:41.400,00:23:43.800,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to add it to both sides",,
00:23:45.300,00:23:49.300,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,"but like but thirteen p is on the same side as negative nine",,,
00:23:50.000,00:23:50.900,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,"well that's separate",,
00:23:50.900,00:23:52.200,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,"that's like separate somehow",,
00:23:52.497,00:23:52.500,00:00:00.003,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:23:52.500,00:23:55.867,00:00:03.367,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"okay but like the paper says that it's separate",,
00:23:55.867,00:23:55.900,00:00:00.033,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"okay but like the paper says that it's separate",,
00:23:55.900,00:23:59.571,00:00:03.671,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I don't know how",,
00:23:59.571,00:23:59.600,00:00:00.029,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I don't know how",,
00:23:59.600,00:24:00.900,00:00:01.300,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"confusing okay",,
00:24:00.900,00:24:00.906,00:00:00.006,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:24:01.273,00:24:01.300,00:00:00.027,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:24:01.300,00:24:07.400,00:00:06.100,"TRC",,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"all right what does the paper say",,,
00:24:07.400,00:24:07.412,00:00:00.012,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:24:08.300,00:24:09.300,00:00:01.000,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"so the I don't know",,,
00:24:09.800,00:24:12.000,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,,"it's not the exact answer to that so",,
00:24:12.000,00:24:12.800,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,"well yeah",,,
00:24:13.200,00:24:15.100,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,"it's a different equation",,
00:24:15.700,00:24:19.800,00:00:04.100,,,,,,,,,,,"so what I'm doing is I'm just switching up the numbers and variable",,
00:24:20.400,00:24:29.300,00:00:08.900,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so what it says to do here is so you got thirteen p equals fifty",,
00:24:30.200,00:24:33.600,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,,"so that is probably correct",,
00:24:34.000,00:24:34.800,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,,"I have no idea",,
00:24:34.800,00:24:38.600,00:00:03.800,,,,,,,,,,"yeah but do we have to do we have to simplify it down to one p",,,
00:24:39.800,00:24:42.200,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,,"no not yet",,
00:24:42.200,00:24:45.400,00:00:03.200,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so then you want to divide",,
00:24:45.600,00:24:45.800,00:00:00.200,,,,,,,,,,"oh",,,
00:24:45.800,00:24:50.000,00:00:04.200,,,,,,,,,,,"thirteen divided b thirteen divide and then",,
00:24:50.000,00:24:52.400,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,"and then fifty divided by thirteen",,,
00:24:52.400,00:24:52.600,00:00:00.200,,,,,,,,,,,"no",,
00:24:53.400,00:24:56.500,00:00:03.100,,,,,,,,,,,"you want to divide well yeah technically",,
00:24:56.500,00:24:56.800,00:00:00.300,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,
00:24:57.600,00:25:03.600,00:00:06.000,,,,,,,,,,,"and that equals pause filler the p equals whatever",,
00:25:03.800,00:25:12.500,00:00:08.700,,,,,,,,,,"fifteen divided by thirteen is right so because if you do or now we do thirteen p divided thirteen which is p",,,
00:25:13.500,00:25:14.200,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,"I think yeah",,,
00:25:14.600,00:25:17.000,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,"and then fifty divided by thirteen",,,
00:25:17.000,00:25:22.600,00:00:05.600,,,,,,,,,,"so we can probably just write that as a fraction right",,,
00:25:23.200,00:25:24.700,00:00:01.500,,,,,,,,,,,"no you can't",,
00:25:24.700,00:25:24.800,00:00:00.100,,,,,,,,,,"no",,,
00:25:24.800,00:25:24.900,00:00:00.100,,,,,,,,,,,"no",,
00:25:24.900,00:25:27.600,00:00:02.700,,,,,,,,,,"oh gosh okay (laughter)",,,
00:25:27.700,00:25:30.700,00:00:03.000,,,,,,,,,,,"you have to divide",,
00:25:31.000,00:25:35.000,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah okay so thirteen and then fifty",,,
00:25:35.000,00:25:36.800,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,"so what's the",,,
00:25:36.800,00:25:39.900,00:00:03.100,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I think you should do the thinner pencil",,

00:26:08.000,00:26:12.000,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,"but thirteen doesn't go perfectly in the fifty does it",,,

00:33:38.700,00:33:41.100,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler underline the circle that kind of thing",,,,
00:33:41.200,00:33:45.400,00:00:04.200,,,,,,,,,"but not actually right now",,,,
00:33:45.700,00:33:49.700,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,"all right okay so the first one",,,
00:33:53.600,00:33:55.300,00:00:01.700,,,,,,,,,,"and then through the three",,,
00:33:56.100,00:33:57.900,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,"so now I guess I'm like the tutor",,,
00:33:58.400,00:34:04.200,00:00:05.800,,,,,,,,,,"so negative three plus x equals twenty-two",,,

00:34:25.600,00:34:26.200,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,"so",,,
00:34:29.300,00:34:34.800,00:00:05.500,,,,,,,,,,"what we probably want to do first is cancel out the three",,,

00:34:37.800,00:34:42.400,00:00:04.600,,,,,,,,,,"so how you think you're going to do that",,,
00:34:42.400,00:34:50.400,00:00:08.000,,,,,,,,,,"(laughter) yeah but you have to add three to both sides",,,
00:34:52.700,00:35:00.700,00:00:08.000,,,,,,,,,,"so then yeah plus twenty-two",,,
00:35:03.200,00:35:04.200,00:00:01.000,,,,,,,,,,,"twenty-five",,
00:35:04.200,00:35:08.200,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and then x equals twenty-five",,,

00:35:20.800,00:35:22.200,00:00:01.400,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"oh my gosh whatever",,,
00:35:22.700,00:35:25.700,00:00:03.000,,,,,,,,,,"okay now on the next one",,,
00:35:29.500,00:35:37.700,00:00:08.200,,,,,,,,,,"you're going to add you're going to like do the same thing except pause filler you're adding like y I think",,,
00:35:40.400,00:35:40.900,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,"so",,,
00:35:44.500,00:35:46.800,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,"so add okay so pause filler",,,
00:35:46.800,00:35:53.500,00:00:06.700,,,,,,,,,,"yeah wait yeah because you could then then you could cancel out the y",,,
00:35:53.700,00:35:56.500,00:00:02.800,,,,,,,,,,"so if you added y to both sides",,,
00:35:56.500,00:35:59.800,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,"then yeah just try doing that",,,
00:35:59.800,00:36:01.100,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,"adding y to both sides",,,
00:36:02.000,00:36:06.700,00:00:04.700,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"the actual weird y because I did not mean to do that",,
00:36:09.700,00:36:15.100,00:00:05.400,,,,,,,,,,"so then yeah and so then that would be twenty-three plus y",,,
00:36:15.100,00:36:18.400,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,,"wait well then that would be eighteen yeah wait",,
00:36:18.400,00:36:24.200,00:00:05.800,,,,,,,,,,"yeah because it would cancel out because the negative y and the positive y just makes zero oh",,,
00:36:26.800,00:36:27.800,00:00:01.000,,,,,,,,,,,"now wait",,
00:36:40.400,00:36:44.700,00:00:04.300,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"it's really awkward that we're like in the building with all these college students",,
00:36:44.700,00:36:47.800,00:00:03.100,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"it's like we're only in like seventh grade",,
00:36:48.100,00:36:50.000,00:00:01.900,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"and we're only like twenty year olds",,
00:36:50.000,00:36:51.900,00:00:01.900,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"it's like hi",,
00:36:51.900,00:36:56.500,00:00:04.600,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"and I don't know you this is really scary okay",,
00:36:56.800,00:37:04.100,00:00:07.300,,,,,,,,,,"all right so if you added y to both sides the ys",,,
00:37:04.200,00:37:08.200,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,,"I think it's adding eighteen",,
00:37:10.000,00:37:20.700,00:00:10.700,,,,,,,,,,"well because if you added y to both sides then you would because you can have the negative y I don't think",,,
00:37:21.400,00:37:27.000,00:00:05.600,,,,,,,,,,"like because then if you add y to both sides",,,
00:37:27.000,00:37:34.500,00:00:07.500,,,,,,,,,,"then pause filler then this the y on this side will become just zero",,,
00:37:34.500,00:37:37.900,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,"sort of like have with the nine it's like you have negative nine plus nine equals zero",,,
00:37:37.900,00:37:48.700,00:00:10.800,,,,,,,,,,"and then this will just become twenty-three plus y equals eighteen oh (laughter) plus y equals eighteen",,,
00:37:48.700,00:37:53.200,00:00:04.500,,,,,,,,,,"and then like and then you could probably subtract twenty-three from each side",,,
00:37:55.200,00:37:55.600,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:37:55.600,00:37:58.300,00:00:02.700,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"you see here you want to try it",,,
00:37:59.100,00:38:14.700,00:00:15.600,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"and I'll like yeah",,,
00:38:23.500,00:38:43.200,00:00:19.700,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"so what's in the box",,,
00:38:44.600,00:38:52.500,00:00:07.900,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"(laughter) all right",,,
00:38:56.200,00:38:57.600,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,"back to the problem (laughter)",,,
00:38:57.800,00:39:00.300,00:00:02.500,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"oh my gosh",,,
00:39:00.400,00:39:01.700,00:00:01.300,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"it's on my leg pause filler",,,
00:39:05.500,00:39:06.000,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,"so",,,
00:39:08.500,00:39:09.100,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,"if we're",,,
00:39:10.900,00:39:12.300,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,"just trying to go through it",,,
00:39:12.300,00:39:15.200,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,"so if we add y to the side",,,
00:39:15.200,00:39:18.900,00:00:03.700,,,,,,,,,,"and we add y to the other side as well",,,
00:39:18.900,00:39:20.500,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,"what do we have",,,
00:39:22.300,00:39:22.400,00:00:00.100,,,,,,,,,,"oh",,,
00:39:33.900,00:39:38.000,00:00:04.100,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I'm still chewing",,
00:39:38.000,00:39:41.300,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so I don't think we add y",,
00:39:42.200,00:39:45.900,00:00:03.700,,,,,,,,,,,"I think we only add y once",,
00:39:46.500,00:39:48.900,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,,"and then it's eighteen plus twenty-three",,
00:39:52.300,00:39:53.100,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,"but yeah",,,
00:39:53.400,00:39:54.100,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,"wait what do you mean",,,
00:39:56.394,00:39:56.400,00:00:00.006,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:39:56.400,00:39:59.400,00:00:03.000,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I'm like explaining the problem now (laughter)",,
00:39:59.400,00:39:59.430,00:00:00.030,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:40:00.700,00:40:07.600,00:00:06.900,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so negative y plus eighteen equals twenty",,
00:40:08.100,00:40:08.600,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,"negative",,,
00:40:10.300,00:40:10.800,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,"what do you mean",,,
00:40:11.100,00:40:13.200,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,"how did you get that because I don't",,,
00:40:13.200,00:40:14.400,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,,"it's the problem up here",,
00:40:14.700,00:40:16.300,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah",,,
00:40:16.300,00:40:22.600,00:00:06.300,,,,,,,,,,"(laughter) I was like where did that come from",,,
00:40:23.100,00:40:28.600,00:00:05.500,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so we would subtract y from eighteen negative y",,
00:40:31.000,00:40:39.300,00:00:08.300,,,,,,,,,,,"and then we would equal twenty-three plus eighteen",,
00:40:42.800,00:40:46.600,00:00:03.800,,,,,,,,,,"but on here they have like the same form",,,
00:40:46.600,00:40:53.000,00:00:06.400,,,,,,,,,,"and they add like y first like",,,
00:40:53.000,00:40:56.600,00:00:03.600,,,,,,,,,,"around here we're pause filler it's like the same thing with different numbers",,,
00:40:57.500,00:41:00.700,00:00:03.200,,,,,,,,,,"they just added like the number they've added like the x first",,,
00:41:02.700,00:41:03.600,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,"and then they add",,,
00:41:03.600,00:41:08.800,00:00:05.200,,,,,,,,,,"and then they subtracted the number so",,,
00:41:10.700,00:41:17.500,00:00:06.800,,,,,,,,,,,"so then it would be eighteen y",,
00:41:17.500,00:41:19.400,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,"what do you mean (laughter)",,,
00:41:19.400,00:41:21.800,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,,"y plus eighteen equals eighteen y",,
00:41:22.300,00:41:23.000,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,"negative y",,,
00:41:23.100,00:41:24.000,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,"remember it's negative",,,
00:41:27.100,00:41:28.700,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,,"then negative eighteen y",,
00:41:29.200,00:41:29.700,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:41:30.000,00:41:38.500,00:00:08.500,,,,,,,,,,"all right negative yeah eighteen negative y what because like no y has to be positive",,,
00:41:42.900,00:41:43.200,00:00:00.300,,,,,,,,,,"doesn't it",,,
00:41:43.200,00:41:45.900,00:00:02.700,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know",,
00:41:46.300,00:41:48.500,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,"that's like start this thing fresh again",,,

00:42:10.300,00:42:14.700,00:00:04.400,,,,,,,,,,"okay so let's try like what I see on the paper",,,
00:42:14.700,00:42:23.400,00:00:08.700,,,,,,,,,,"so let's try plus y on the side plus y on this side",,,
00:42:23.800,00:42:26.600,00:00:02.800,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"don't you want to make the ink a little smaller",,
00:42:27.500,00:42:28.500,00:00:01.000,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"yeah I can try that",,,
00:42:30.600,00:42:31.100,00:00:00.500,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"here we go",,,
00:42:31.100,00:42:33.000,00:00:01.900,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"oh that's really strong",,,
00:42:33.000,00:42:35.200,00:00:02.200,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"okay there we go",,,
00:42:35.200,00:42:42.500,00:00:07.300,,,,,,,,,,"so now so if we add y on both sides what do we have",,,
00:42:42.700,00:42:48.900,00:00:06.200,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so well this is zero",,
00:42:48.900,00:42:51.100,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that would cancel out",,,
00:42:51.600,00:42:54.100,00:00:02.500,,,,,,,,,,,"and this is eighteen y",,
00:42:54.400,00:42:54.800,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,"so no",,,
00:42:55.100,00:42:57.500,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,"you won't need the",,,
00:42:57.500,00:42:58.200,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,,"how",,
00:42:58.200,00:43:03.000,00:00:04.800,,,,,,,,,,"you wouldn't need the eighteen because you would add by each side",,,
00:43:03.000,00:43:06.000,00:00:03.000,,,,,,,,,,"so you would add y to each side of the equation",,,
00:43:06.000,00:43:06.800,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,"so you would add y to",,,
00:43:06.800,00:43:07.400,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,,"oh twenty-three",,
00:43:07.400,00:43:09.000,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,,"it's twenty-three y",,
00:43:09.500,00:43:10.700,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,"twenty-three plus y yeah",,,
00:43:12.500,00:43:19.600,00:00:07.100,,,,,,,,,,"so now it's going to be eighteen because it equals twenty-three plus y",,,
00:43:23.500,00:43:24.100,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,"and then",,,
00:43:27.200,00:43:30.600,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,"and then what do we do pause filler it's",,,

00:46:55.000,00:46:56.400,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,"and you add k to this side",,,
00:46:57.700,00:46:59.300,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,"this will be canceled out",,,
00:46:59.300,00:47:00.000,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,"and just be zero",,,
00:47:00.000,00:47:05.600,00:00:05.600,,,,,,,,,,"so it will be negative fourteen equals thirty-six",,,
00:47:05.600,00:47:09.400,00:00:03.800,,,,,,,,,,"and then since we add another k to the k it would be plus two k",,,
