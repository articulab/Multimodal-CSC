00:07:57.288,00:08:01.189,00:00:03.901,,,,,,,,,,,"the pause filler page number's down there",,,
00:08:01.628,00:08:02.895,00:00:01.267,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",,
00:08:13.451,00:08:19.000,00:00:05.549,,,,,,,,,"all right sorry about that so that's okay",,,,,

00:09:01.023,00:09:17.166,00:00:16.143,,,,,,,,,"so you have twenty minutes to help them work through as many problems as you can",,,,,
00:09:17.166,00:09:26.794,00:00:09.628,,,,,,,,,"pause filler just remember pause filler to make sure that you aren't solving the problems yourself",,,,,
00:09:26.794,00:09:44.524,00:00:17.730,,,,,,,,,"just use the stylus to circle or underline if you need to",,,,,
00:09:45.502,00:09:52.915,00:00:07.413,,,,,,,,,"but let them solve the problems",,,,,
00:09:52.985,00:10:02.214,00:00:09.229,,,,,,,,,"pause filler no pressure if you can't get through them all",,,,,
00:10:02.214,00:10:05.925,00:00:03.711,,,,,,,,,"and so if you can go ahead and get started",,,,,
00:10:05.925,00:10:07.641,00:00:01.716,,,,,,,,,,"so there's one on every page",,,,
00:10:07.641,00:10:08.210,00:00:00.569,,,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,
00:10:08.300,00:10:11.732,00:00:03.432,,,,,,,,,,"so I just go to there to go to the next problem",,,,
00:10:11.772,00:10:12.032,00:00:00.260,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,,
00:10:12.032,00:10:14.227,00:00:02.195,,,,,,,,,,"and they work they do the problem",,,,
00:10:14.316,00:10:20.562,00:00:06.246,,,,,,,,,"yeah and you can like talk to each other about the problems",,,,,
00:10:20.582,00:10:26.269,00:00:05.687,,,,,,,,,"and you can put your headphones back on",,,,,
00:10:26.758,00:10:38.471,00:00:11.713,,,,,,,,,"and then when I come back (inaudible) you can just take them off and can you (inaudible)",,,,,

00:11:22.142,00:11:45.768,00:00:23.626,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler you can start",,,,
00:11:45.888,00:12:00.904,00:00:15.016,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"okay so pause filler all right this thing's weird to control pause filler",,
00:12:25.029,00:12:29.679,00:00:04.650,,,,,,,,,,,,"so is this how pause filler to start the equation",,
00:12:29.938,00:12:39.696,00:00:09.758,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah so then the sixes cancel out",,,,
00:12:39.925,00:12:40.065,00:00:00.140,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:12:40.115,00:12:42.230,00:00:02.115,,,,,,,,,,"and then you add thirteen to six",,,,
00:12:42.809,00:12:47.000,00:00:04.191,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay so you get x equals pause filler nineteen",,
00:12:47.000,00:12:47.259,00:00:00.259,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler",,"yeah okay so you get x equals pause filler nineteen",,
00:12:47.259,00:12:47.837,00:00:00.578,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler",,,,
00:12:47.837,00:12:48.000,00:00:00.163,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler",,"all right so fifteen equals negative eight plus p",,
00:12:48.000,00:12:57.236,00:00:09.236,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so fifteen equals negative eight plus p",,
00:12:57.426,00:13:01.047,00:00:03.621,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so you have fifteen",,
00:13:02.315,00:13:03.422,00:00:01.107,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you add eight",,
00:13:03.422,00:13:06.984,00:00:03.562,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you undo the eights correct okay",,
00:13:07.054,00:13:07.283,00:00:00.229,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:13:08.261,00:13:22.399,00:00:14.138,,,,,,,,,,,,"eight and so the eights cancel out",,
00:13:22.688,00:13:24.105,00:00:01.417,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you get fifteen plus eight",,
00:13:24.324,00:13:29.832,00:00:05.508,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler you get twenty-three",,
00:13:31.159,00:13:31.378,00:00:00.219,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:13:31.688,00:13:44.229,00:00:12.541,,,,,,,,,,,,"equals p okay all right so this problem works the same as everything else",,
00:13:44.898,00:13:45.227,00:00:00.329,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah",,,,
00:13:45.227,00:13:50.834,00:00:05.607,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you use thirteen minus eleven",,
00:14:00.901,00:14:05.571,00:00:04.670,,,,,,,,,,,,"seventeen minus eleven is six equals k",,
00:14:16.027,00:14:20.108,00:00:04.081,,,,,,,,,,,,"so for this problem you would divide out the forty-four",,
00:14:20.477,00:14:20.796,00:00:00.319,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:14:20.986,00:14:54.220,00:00:33.234,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay pause filler two twenty divided by forty-four is pause filler forty-five",,
00:14:55.677,00:15:01.324,00:00:05.647,,,,,,,,,,,,"so I have five",,
00:15:01.374,00:15:05.584,00:00:04.210,,,,,,,,,,,,"because twenty two hundred twenty divided by forty-four is five",,
00:15:06.203,00:15:06.542,00:00:00.339,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:15:11.870,00:15:47.479,00:00:35.609,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler negative nine plus thirteen p it pause filler fifty",,
00:15:47.938,00:15:48.547,00:00:00.609,,,,,,,,,,"fifty",,,,
00:15:48.826,00:16:15.196,00:00:26.370,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so p equals fifty thirteenths pause filler four (inaudible) almost done (inaudible)",,
00:16:22.849,00:16:38.543,00:00:15.694,,,,,,,,,,,,"twenty twenty-four over six over six equals pause filler four okay",,
00:16:48.600,00:17:12.000,00:00:23.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"forty plus (inaudible) forty plus twenty-two is sixty-two",,
00:17:12.000,00:17:13.000,00:00:01.000,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler",,"forty plus (inaudible) forty plus twenty-two is sixty-two",,
00:17:13.000,00:17:13.603,00:00:00.603,,,,,,,,,,,,"forty plus (inaudible) forty plus twenty-two is sixty-two",,
00:17:14.412,00:17:55.668,00:00:41.256,,,,,,,,,,,,"equals pause filler yeah sixty-two fifteenths equals k (inaudible) twenty yeah",,
00:18:13.617,00:18:15.173,00:00:01.556,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that's right",,,,
00:18:15.403,00:18:18.985,00:00:03.582,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so they pretty much follow the same rules of just going",,
00:18:19.783,00:18:20.122,00:00:00.339,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:18:20.242,00:18:26.208,00:00:05.966,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah all right so",,
00:18:27.456,00:18:34.120,00:00:06.664,,,,,,,,,,"okay so what you do is you subtract this p",,,,
00:18:34.819,00:18:35.228,00:00:00.409,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler okay",,
00:18:35.487,00:18:36.854,00:00:01.367,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler from this p",,,,
00:18:37.084,00:18:39.957,00:00:02.873,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you want all the variables on one side",,
00:18:39.957,00:18:53.925,00:00:13.968,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you get the equation",,
00:18:56.370,00:18:57.577,00:00:01.207,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:18:59.173,00:19:12.064,00:00:12.891,,,,,,,,,,,,"twelve pause filler nope (inaudible) so you get fifteen equals four p",,
00:19:12.932,00:19:16.494,00:00:03.562,,,,,,,,,,"one two p because you're subtracting",,,,
00:19:17.342,00:19:26.491,00:00:09.149,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh okay thank you (inaudible) twelve pause filler three because you subtract twelve",,
00:19:27.230,00:19:35.271,00:00:08.041,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you get three equals two p or one-point-five equals p",,
00:19:36.798,00:19:37.267,00:00:00.469,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,,,
00:19:42.066,00:19:43.822,00:00:01.756,,,,,,,,,,,,"you get pause filler k",,
00:19:43.822,00:19:48.222,00:00:04.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"you'd subtract the k to get seven k",,
00:19:49.050,00:19:49.240,00:00:00.190,,,,,,,,,,"no",,,,
00:19:50.068,00:19:50.247,00:00:00.179,,,,,,,,,,,,"right",,
00:19:50.247,00:19:53.430,00:00:03.183,,,,,,,,,,"this the eight k would become the seven k",,,,
00:19:53.550,00:19:56.363,00:00:02.813,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and that equals ten",,
00:19:57.132,00:19:57.471,00:00:00.339,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:19:57.621,00:20:00.594,00:00:02.973,,,,,,,,,,,,"negative ten negative ten because there's a subtraction sign there",,
00:20:00.993,00:20:03.936,00:00:02.943,,,,,,,,,,,,"then you add the sixty-eight to get",,
00:20:04.695,00:20:09.005,00:00:04.310,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler seven k equals seventy-eight",,
00:20:10.412,00:20:17.635,00:00:07.223,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you get k equals pause filler seventy-eight sevenths",,
00:20:19.471,00:20:22.664,00:00:03.193,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler that may or may not be reducible",,
00:20:22.664,00:20:24.579,00:00:01.915,,,,,,,,,,,,"but that is the answer",,
00:20:24.968,00:20:25.348,00:00:00.380,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:20:29.588,00:20:37.430,00:00:07.842,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"okay pause filler do you have any idea where they are",,
00:20:38.228,00:20:38.897,00:00:00.669,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,"nope",,,,
00:20:39.226,00:20:50.012,00:00:10.786,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"okay then pause filler they're somewhere near where I am",,
00:20:57.135,00:21:17.958,00:00:20.823,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so you're going to continue in your same roles",,,
00:21:18.128,00:21:19.844,00:00:01.716,,,,,,,,,,,,"what",,
00:21:22.877,00:21:24.793,00:00:01.916,,,,,,,,,,,"you're going to stay in the same roles",,,
00:21:24.922,00:21:25.062,00:00:00.140,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,
00:21:25.142,00:21:27.000,00:00:01.858,,,,,,,,,,,"he's going to be tutoring you",,,
00:21:27.000,00:21:27.666,00:00:00.666,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler (inaudible)",,,
00:21:27.666,00:21:29.000,00:00:01.334,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler (inaudible)","okay",,
00:21:29.000,00:21:29.023,00:00:00.023,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,
00:21:29.053,00:21:29.841,00:00:00.788,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,
00:21:30.110,00:21:32.086,00:00:01.976,,,,,,,,,"so you guys got to the",,,,,
00:21:32.086,00:21:32.146,00:00:00.060,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:21:32.146,00:21:36.067,00:00:03.921,,,,,,,,,"next page okay now was this a new",,,,,
00:21:36.087,00:21:41.235,00:00:05.148,,,,,,,,,"I guess they already moved it for you",,,,,
00:21:42.253,00:21:42.562,00:00:00.309,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:21:43.360,00:21:44.568,00:00:01.208,,,,,,,,,"all right",,,,,
00:21:44.568,00:21:47.032,00:00:02.464,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so you have pause filler",,
00:21:47.381,00:21:50.384,00:00:03.003,,,,,,,,,,,,"you subtract the r",,
00:21:50.384,00:21:52.619,00:00:02.235,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so you're left with one r",,
00:21:52.619,00:22:00.242,00:00:07.623,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you get negative thirty-three equals pause filler r minus fifteen",,
00:22:00.841,00:22:03.275,00:00:02.434,,,,,,,,,,,,"you add fifteen to both sides",,
00:22:05.041,00:22:16.675,00:00:11.634,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you get pause filler negative thirty-three plus fifteen is negative twenty pause filler eighteen",,
00:22:16.675,00:22:20.636,00:00:03.961,,,,,,,,,,,,"you have eighteen",,
00:22:20.636,00:22:21.164,00:00:00.528,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yes",,,,
00:22:21.264,00:22:23.599,00:00:02.335,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so yeah negative eighteen equals r",,
00:22:27.749,00:22:33.796,00:00:06.047,,,,,,,,,,"okay so it's the same thing",,,,
00:22:34.235,00:22:37.557,00:00:03.322,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay so you subtract u",,
00:22:37.886,00:22:47.435,00:00:09.549,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you get negative forty-two equals eight plus three u",,
00:22:47.435,00:22:53.680,00:00:06.245,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you get equals then you get",,
00:22:53.680,00:22:56.255,00:00:02.575,,,,,,,,,,,,"then you subtract the eight",,
00:22:57.043,00:22:59.168,00:00:02.125,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you get negative fifty",,
00:23:00.774,00:23:04.666,00:00:03.892,,,,,,,,,,,,"fifty equals three u",,
00:23:04.666,00:23:06.771,00:00:02.105,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you get pause filler",,
00:23:06.771,00:23:08.437,00:00:01.666,,,,,,,,,,,,"you divide by three",,
00:23:08.437,00:23:25.418,00:00:16.981,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you get negative fifty thirds equals u okay pause filler just larger numbers (laughs) all right",,
00:23:25.418,00:23:26.466,00:00:01.048,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you subtract the n",,
00:23:26.715,00:23:28.172,00:00:01.457,,,,,,,,,,,,"you get ninety-nine n",,
00:23:28.172,00:23:39.397,00:00:11.225,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you get one hundred six equals pause filler ninety-nine n plus seven n seven",,
