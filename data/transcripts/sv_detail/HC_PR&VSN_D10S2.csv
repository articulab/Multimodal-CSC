00:05:52.861,00:05:53.679,00:00:00.818,,,,,,,,,,,,"I broken it",
00:05:53.679,00:05:58.877,00:00:05.198,,,,,,,,,,,,"and I sent it to get them fixed or",
00:05:58.877,00:06:00.284,00:00:01.407,,,,,,,,,,,,"I've to use my sister's",
00:06:00.284,00:06:03.466,00:00:03.182,,,,,,,,,,,,"but it's obviously like the same type of computer",
00:06:03.466,00:06:05.991,00:00:02.525,,,,,,,,,,,,"I know right now they have the bigger ones",
00:06:05.991,00:06:08.595,00:00:02.604,,,,,,,,,,,,"is yours like smaller than usual",
00:06:09.862,00:06:11.827,00:00:01.965,,,,,,,,,,,,"or is it normal size",
00:06:11.987,00:06:12.626,00:00:00.639,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know",,,
00:06:12.626,00:06:17.854,00:00:05.228,,,,,,,,,,"out of all the laptops I've had probably like the third biggest",,,
00:06:18.353,00:06:20.617,00:00:02.264,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah mine is like really small",
00:06:20.617,00:06:27.342,00:00:06.725,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's probably even smaller than this cad thing",
00:06:27.342,00:06:29.218,00:00:01.876,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you must have the same one as my sister then",,,
00:06:29.218,00:06:31.872,00:00:02.654,,,,,,,,,,"because my sister has like the older and half the size of this",,,
00:06:31.952,00:06:34.875,00:00:02.923,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I don't know why they make it so small",
00:06:34.875,00:06:37.868,00:00:02.993,,,,,,,,,,,,"but it's probably because when I type on that computer",
00:06:37.868,00:06:40.303,00:00:02.435,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then I type on a bigger computer and",
00:06:40.343,00:06:41.251,00:00:00.908,,,,,,,,,,"and like way (inaudible)",,,
00:06:41.370,00:06:43.485,00:00:02.115,,,,,,,,,,,,"I yeah and I always mistype",
00:06:43.775,00:06:47.716,00:00:03.941,,,,,,,,,,,,"because my hands are so used to typing on a smaller ones",
00:06:47.716,00:06:50.390,00:00:02.674,,,,,,,,,,,,"when it's bigger it's like throws everything off",
00:06:50.470,00:07:00.397,00:00:09.927,,,,,,,,,,,,"and so there's always typos sort of like change to do stuff on my sister's computer any computer that's normal sized",
00:07:00.397,00:07:04.129,00:00:03.732,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and I am pretty bad at typing anyway so",,,
00:07:04.129,00:07:06.344,00:00:02.215,,,,,,,,,,,,"I used to be horrible at typing",
00:07:06.344,00:07:10.734,00:00:04.390,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then I think just from doing cyber school I got better at it",
00:07:10.734,00:07:12.510,00:00:01.776,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm not going to say I'm fast",
00:07:12.669,00:07:15.762,00:00:03.093,,,,,,,,,,,,"but I can do it better than I could three years ago",
00:07:17.678,00:07:20.491,00:00:02.813,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I'm pretty slow at it (laughter)",,,
00:07:20.491,00:07:25.650,00:00:05.159,,,,,,,,,,,,"but it's better than my handwriting",
00:07:25.650,00:07:27.037,00:00:01.387,,,,,,,,,,,,"and everything is all perfect",
00:07:27.037,00:07:31.806,00:00:04.769,,,,,,,,,,,,"so I would prefer than to writing on paper",
00:07:31.806,00:07:40.755,00:00:08.949,,,,,,,,,,,"okay cool our server is functioning properly",,
00:07:40.755,00:07:45.066,00:00:04.311,,,,,,,,,,,"and we're good to go",,
00:07:45.066,00:07:45.874,00:00:00.808,,,,,,,,,,,"so we're ready",,

00:07:50.224,00:07:52.708,00:00:02.484,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler and just make sure that she's not solving (inaudible)",,
00:07:52.708,00:07:53.297,00:00:00.589,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait what (inaudible)",
00:07:53.297,00:07:57.368,00:00:04.071,,,,,,,,,"those are like this has to be here",,,,
00:07:57.368,00:08:01.159,00:00:03.791,,,,,,,,,,,"just make sure that she's not pause filler solving for you",,
00:08:01.159,00:08:03.005,00:00:01.846,,,,,,,,,,,"that you're the one solving",,
00:08:03.005,00:08:05.868,00:00:02.863,,,,,,,,,,,"and she's kind of helping you and teaching you",,
00:08:05.868,00:08:07.335,00:00:01.467,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so you can get started",,
00:08:07.335,00:08:09.799,00:00:02.464,,,,,,,,,,,"you have twenty minutes",,
00:08:09.799,00:08:12.214,00:00:02.415,,,,,,,,,,,"just answer as many as you can",,
00:08:12.214,00:08:13.441,00:00:01.227,,,,,,,,,,,"just make sure you show you work and mm-hmm",,
00:08:13.441,00:08:17.292,00:00:03.851,,,,,,,,,"and pause filler if you have a problem just come and get us",,,,
00:08:17.292,00:08:17.991,00:00:00.699,,,,,,,,,"we'll probably tell you",,,,
00:08:17.991,00:08:18.829,00:00:00.838,,,,,,,,,"just keep working",,,,
00:08:18.829,00:08:22.900,00:00:04.071,,,,,,,,,,,,"we have twenty minutes all the way",
00:08:22.900,00:08:25.075,00:00:02.175,,,,,,,,,,,,"because we have two different times",
00:08:25.075,00:08:28.158,00:00:03.083,,,,,,,,,,,,"we're trying to figure out which one is correct",
00:08:28.158,00:08:29.524,00:00:01.366,,,,,,,,,"mine says seven twenty-eight",,,,
00:08:29.524,00:08:29.963,00:00:00.439,,,,,,,,,,"that's mine",,,
00:08:29.963,00:08:31.001,00:00:01.038,,,,,,,,,,,,"I got eight ���o seven",
00:08:31.001,00:08:31.410,00:00:00.409,,,,,,,,,"eight ���o seven",,,,
00:08:31.470,00:08:33.585,00:00:02.115,,,,,,,,,,"well what did I say eight ���o seven",,,
00:08:33.585,00:08:35.581,00:00:01.996,,,,,,,,,"but that's incorrect",,,,
00:08:35.581,00:08:36.838,00:00:01.257,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:08:37.387,00:08:38.813,00:00:01.426,,,,,,,,,,,,"very",
00:08:38.833,00:08:40.929,00:00:02.096,,,,,,,,,"so you have twenty minutes pause filler yeah",,,,
00:08:41.048,00:08:42.335,00:00:01.287,,,,,,,,,,,,"just ask me for the time",
00:08:42.335,00:08:44.261,00:00:01.926,,,,,,,,,,,,"and I'll tell you what's the time",
00:08:44.999,00:08:47.364,00:00:02.365,,,,,,,,,"all right I'll be back",,,,
00:08:47.723,00:08:51.594,00:00:03.871,,,,,,,,,"you have twenty minutes",,,,
00:08:51.814,00:08:54.248,00:00:02.434,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh twenty minutes really",
00:08:54.268,00:08:56.304,00:00:02.036,,,,,,,,,,"I know right I know (inaudible)",,,
00:08:57.082,00:09:04.016,00:00:06.934,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so this isn't anything new I don't think",
00:09:04.635,00:09:05.084,00:00:00.449,,,,,,,,,,"nope",,,
00:09:05.084,00:09:06.590,00:00:01.506,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm going to draw the line",
00:09:06.680,00:09:09.384,00:00:02.704,,,,,,,,,,,,"because that helps me for some reason",
00:09:09.484,00:09:16.089,00:00:06.605,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm guessing I'm supposed to subtract x",
00:09:16.089,00:09:20.638,00:00:04.549,,,,,,,,,,,,"because that's what the papers were saying",
00:09:20.638,00:09:23.502,00:00:02.864,,,,,,,,,,,,"is that correct because no",
00:09:23.502,00:09:25.058,00:00:01.556,,,,,,,,,,,,"no I'm supposed to divide x",
00:09:25.677,00:09:27.094,00:00:01.417,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm not sure one minute",
00:09:27.094,00:09:32.980,00:00:05.886,,,,,,,,,,,,"let me think pause filler yeah yeah",
00:09:36.802,00:09:40.623,00:00:03.821,,,,,,,,,,,,"and just make this forty over x",
00:09:40.842,00:09:41.770,00:00:00.928,,,,,,,,,,"cool",,,
00:09:42.379,00:09:49.872,00:00:07.493,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay this might be right",
00:09:49.872,00:10:00.977,00:00:11.105,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then if I did that I have eight over seven equals forty oops",
00:10:00.977,00:10:04.189,00:00:03.212,,,,,,,,,,,,"oops I clicked the find okay",
00:10:04.349,00:10:06.105,00:00:01.756,,,,,,,,,,"not that button",,,
00:10:06.105,00:10:08.230,00:00:02.125,,,,,,,,,,,,"I wish it was red",
00:10:08.230,00:10:13.039,00:00:04.809,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then it can say don't click the red button",
00:10:14.047,00:10:19.425,00:00:05.378,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay does that make any sense I think",
00:10:19.465,00:10:20.522,00:00:01.057,,,,,,,,,,"I think so",,,
00:10:20.792,00:10:21.610,00:00:00.818,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think",
00:10:21.610,00:10:24.842,00:00:03.232,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler maybe we're using cross products",,,
00:10:24.842,00:10:28.444,00:00:03.602,,,,,,,,,,"where like it go seven times forty and three times x equals",,,
00:10:28.444,00:10:32.984,00:00:04.540,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh you could do that or you could just",
00:10:34.061,00:10:36.356,00:00:02.295,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think I did that wrong",
00:10:36.356,00:10:36.845,00:00:00.489,,,,,,,,,,,,"what do you think",
00:10:36.845,00:10:38.252,00:00:01.407,,,,,,,,,,,,"because I think I did that wrong",
00:10:38.751,00:10:41.165,00:00:02.414,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler when I learned it it was set up this way",,,
00:10:41.165,00:10:42.432,00:00:01.267,,,,,,,,,,"but we used cross products",,,
00:10:42.432,00:10:45.934,00:00:03.502,,,,,,,,,,"so it would be forty times seven and forty times x",,,
00:10:46.344,00:10:46.613,00:00:00.269,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",
00:10:46.613,00:10:51.173,00:00:04.560,,,,,,,,,,"but it's not about how I learned it so no promises (laughter)",,,
00:10:51.173,00:11:08.812,00:00:17.639,,,,,,,,,,,,"so forty times does that mean just got to cross that out",
00:11:09.261,00:11:19.937,00:00:10.676,,,,,,,,,,"or maybe we're supposed to multiply both the sides by the thing worth writing so like three seven times three seven and forty time three seventh",,,
00:11:19.937,00:11:21.933,00:00:01.996,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that might make sense",
00:11:21.933,00:11:25.594,00:00:03.661,,,,,,,,,,,,"but like that's doing the same thing right",
00:11:25.594,00:11:26.722,00:00:01.128,,,,,,,,,,"yeah pretty much",,,
00:11:26.722,00:11:34.994,00:00:08.272,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay I'm going to try this so forty times seven",
00:11:34.994,00:11:35.013,00:00:00.019,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,"okay I'm going to try this so forty times seven",
00:11:35.013,00:11:51.705,00:00:16.692,"TRC",,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"how come I don't have that memorized",
00:11:51.705,00:11:51.711,00:00:00.006,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,"I don't know",,,
00:11:51.711,00:11:52.373,00:00:00.662,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,"I don't know",,,
00:11:52.373,00:11:54.279,00:00:01.906,,,,,,,,,,,,"let's do it in my head",
00:11:54.279,00:12:01.473,00:00:07.194,,,,,,,,,,,,"would that be two hundred and eighty",
00:12:01.553,00:12:02.341,00:00:00.788,,,,,,,,,,,,"that's what I got",
00:12:02.341,00:12:03.289,00:00:00.948,,,,,,,,,,"yeah two eighty",,,
00:12:03.289,00:12:06.262,00:00:02.973,,,,,,,,,,,,"two eighty that way right that's the top or the bottom",
00:12:06.282,00:12:07.190,00:00:00.908,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think that's the top",
00:12:07.190,00:12:09.435,00:00:02.245,,,,,,,,,,"top because forty times seven",,,
00:12:09.435,00:12:12.378,00:00:02.943,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah over a three x then",
00:12:12.837,00:12:13.046,00:00:00.209,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:12:13.046,00:12:22.844,00:00:09.798,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then I'm confused",
00:12:23.343,00:12:41.761,00:00:18.418,,,,,,,,,,,,"because it's supposed to say like in the format of this equals like constant constant constant equals variable or something like that",
00:12:42.629,00:12:45.852,00:00:03.223,,,,,,,,,,,,"so now it's just fraction",
00:12:45.852,00:12:48.845,00:00:02.993,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh well I'll see",
00:12:48.845,00:12:51.759,00:00:02.914,,,,,,,,,,,,"maybe I'll get the right answer and just be doing it the wrong way",
00:12:51.759,00:12:59.301,00:00:07.542,,,,,,,,,,,,"so try to get rid of yeah see",
00:12:59.301,00:13:02.724,00:00:03.423,,,,,,,,,,,,"now this is all messed up",
00:13:03.013,00:13:07.433,00:00:04.420,,,,,,,,,,"I'm looking at it",,,
00:13:07.802,00:13:10.965,00:00:03.163,,,,,,,,,,"I'm not quite sure",,,
00:13:11.075,00:13:12.382,00:00:01.307,,,,,,,,,,"I never learned about this one",,,
00:13:12.581,00:13:17.670,00:00:05.089,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay maybe I should try it a different way",
00:13:17.670,00:13:20.344,00:00:02.674,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then if it doesn't work I'll come back to it",
00:13:20.413,00:13:25.083,00:00:04.670,,,,,,,,,,"it sounds like a hundred equals the fraction with a number (inaudible)",,,
00:13:25.542,00:13:27.896,00:00:02.354,,,,,,,,,,"so it says to go like first",,,
00:13:27.896,00:13:30.211,00:00:02.315,,,,,,,,,,"it would be forty times thirty-seven",,,
00:13:30.211,00:13:32.007,00:00:01.796,,,,,,,,,,"and then that's the answer",,,
00:13:33.234,00:13:36.846,00:00:03.612,,,,,,,,,,,,"forty times what",
00:13:37.046,00:13:40.997,00:00:03.951,,,,,,,,,,"thirty-seven so",,,
00:13:40.997,00:13:42.673,00:00:01.676,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay how would you do that",
00:13:42.673,00:13:46.614,00:00:03.941,,,,,,,,,,"I think we might have to set up a forty as a fraction",,,
00:13:46.614,00:13:51.323,00:00:04.709,,,,,,,,,,"so maybe we could put it over one forty over one times",,,
00:13:52.141,00:13:54.067,00:00:01.926,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that makes sense",
00:13:54.067,00:13:54.356,00:00:00.289,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:13:54.356,00:13:55.903,00:00:01.547,,,,,,,,,,,,"three that's a bad three",
00:13:55.903,00:13:57.988,00:00:02.085,,,,,,,,,,,,"but at least I know it's a three",
00:13:57.988,00:13:58.357,00:00:00.369,,,,,,,,,,"yeah it's a three (laughter)",,,
00:13:58.357,00:14:12.315,00:00:13.958,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay times forty over one",
00:14:12.315,00:14:16.077,00:00:03.762,,,,,,,,,,"so let me find the common denominator and all that",,,
00:14:16.246,00:14:18.242,00:00:01.996,,,,,,,,,,,,"or wait can I just do this no can I no",
00:14:18.242,00:14:26.822,00:00:08.580,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think kind of multiplying",
00:14:26.822,00:14:28.708,00:00:01.886,,,,,,,,,,,,"can you just go straight across",
00:14:28.768,00:14:29.456,00:00:00.688,,,,,,,,,,"I think so yeah",,,
00:14:29.536,00:14:32.949,00:00:03.413,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah it's adding and subtracting",
00:14:32.949,00:14:38.246,00:00:05.297,,,,,,,,,,,,"but you have to find the common denominator I think",
00:14:38.246,00:14:41.200,00:00:02.954,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I think so",,,
00:14:41.200,00:14:42.597,00:00:01.397,,,,,,,,,,"I'm not sure",,,

00:14:45.650,00:14:48.962,00:00:03.312,,,,,,,,,,,,"(inaudible) so it would be one twenty",
00:14:49.162,00:14:55.378,00:00:06.216,,,,,,,,,,"one twenty over one or one twenty and ten also I think we got it (laughter)",,,
00:14:55.378,00:15:00.536,00:00:05.158,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so we have one twenty over seven",
00:15:00.566,00:15:09.007,00:00:08.441,,,,,,,,,,,,"we do have to simplify that over one or wait divide it",

00:17:58.531,00:17:59.649,00:00:01.118,,,,,,,,,,"wait you have forty-nine",,,

00:18:00.098,00:18:01.714,00:00:01.616,,,,,,,,,,"because it will go",,,
00:18:01.714,00:18:03.590,00:00:01.876,,,,,,,,,,,,"it goes into seven",
00:18:03.590,00:18:06.673,00:00:03.083,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh wait seven goes and fifty pause filler seven times",
00:18:06.673,00:18:14.605,00:00:07.932,,,,,,,,,,"because with the seven fourteen twenty-one twenty-eight thirty-two or no no nothing I can remember",,,

00:18:26.338,00:18:32.903,00:00:06.565,,,,,,,,,,"we'll just go one twenty over seven (laughter)",,,
00:18:32.963,00:18:37.393,00:00:04.430,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah can I scroll down for a while",
00:18:37.393,00:18:40.955,00:00:03.562,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'll just do up to this side",

00:18:50.862,00:18:52.788,00:00:01.926,,,,,,,,,,,,"and what do you do",
00:18:52.788,00:18:56.270,00:00:03.482,,,,,,,,,,,,"can I just say r one",
00:18:56.270,00:18:57.018,00:00:00.748,,,,,,,,,,"then you get a one",,,
00:18:57.018,00:18:58.385,00:00:01.367,,,,,,,,,,"and then you'd get another zero",,,
00:18:58.385,00:19:01.508,00:00:03.123,,,,,,,,,,"so you get ten one time",,,
00:19:01.508,00:19:03.055,00:00:01.547,,,,,,,,,,,,"so ten okay",
00:19:03.344,00:19:04.841,00:00:01.497,,,,,,,,,,"this is a repeating process",,,
00:19:04.841,00:19:07.235,00:00:02.394,,,,,,,,,,,,"I really need to scroll down scrolling",

00:19:08.891,00:19:11.645,00:00:02.754,,,,,,,,,,"this will just be pretty much",,,
00:19:11.665,00:19:14.678,00:00:03.013,,,,,,,,,,"but this will pretty much just be a repeating thing",,,
00:19:14.678,00:19:17.292,00:00:02.614,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah right one repeating seventeen",
00:19:17.292,00:19:20.565,00:00:03.273,,,,,,,,,,"so seventeen what's seventeen seventeen seventeen",,,
00:19:20.565,00:19:20.625,00:00:00.060,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:19:20.625,00:19:21.732,00:00:01.107,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,"so it will be a long decimal",,,
00:19:21.732,00:19:22.929,00:00:01.197,,,,,,,,,,"so just say seven",,,
00:19:22.929,00:19:25.075,00:00:02.146,,,,,,,,,,,,"fifteen point one repeated right",
00:19:25.174,00:19:25.334,00:00:00.160,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:19:26.721,00:19:30.323,00:00:03.602,,,,,,,,,,,,"one repeated so what was it",
00:19:30.323,00:19:47.224,00:00:16.901,,,,,,,,,,,,"the variable x equals pause filler seventeen point one p",
00:19:47.224,00:19:50.822,00:00:03.598,,,,,,,,,,,,"encircle it so people know that's the very answer",

00:19:56.753,00:19:58.638,00:00:01.885,,,,,,,,,,"next to go",,,
00:19:58.708,00:20:02.180,00:00:03.472,,,,,,,,,,,,"finally again this is like same thing",
00:20:02.240,00:20:04.266,00:00:02.026,,,,,,,,,,,,"this wasn't on the paper",
00:20:04.266,00:20:05.602,00:00:01.336,,,,,,,,,,,,"this was on the paper",
00:20:05.622,00:20:06.710,00:00:01.088,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think it was on paper now",
00:20:06.710,00:20:08.695,00:00:01.985,,,,,,,,,,,,"it just didn't get far enough",
00:20:08.695,00:20:13.804,00:00:05.109,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay yeah except I don't have a paper",
00:20:13.904,00:20:16.338,00:00:02.434,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so what does it say to do",
00:20:16.418,00:20:22.684,00:00:06.266,,,,,,,,,,"it says this one is a hundred equals two over three y",,,
00:20:23.053,00:20:27.702,00:00:04.649,,,,,,,,,,"so it says multiply both sides by three over two",,,
00:20:27.702,00:20:30.177,00:00:02.475,,,,,,,,,,"and then it gets a hundred and fifty",,,
00:20:30.177,00:20:33.948,00:00:03.771,,,,,,,,,,,,"so multiply oh yeah that makes sense now okay",
00:20:33.968,00:20:36.113,00:00:02.145,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you're trying to get k",
00:20:36.113,00:20:39.456,00:00:03.343,,,,,,,,,,,,"so we'll multiply why side by three over eight",
00:20:39.456,00:20:45.971,00:00:06.515,,,,,,,,,,"because three over eight times three over eight we'll cross cancel that out so fourteen time three over eight",,,
00:20:46.250,00:20:54.841,00:00:08.591,,,,,,,,,,,,"so here I just got k and then oh three over eight and the answer",
00:20:54.841,00:21:07.212,00:00:12.371,,,,,,,,,,,,"this has been a b equal to k times fourteen over one equals",
00:21:07.322,00:21:09.906,00:00:02.584,,,,,,,,,,"maybe I guess a lowest common denominator thing",,,
00:21:09.906,00:21:16.032,00:00:06.126,,,,,,,,,,,,"maybe or you just got to like divide or something",
00:21:16.032,00:21:18.198,00:00:02.166,,,,,,,,,,"because one could go into eight pretty easily",,,
00:21:18.198,00:21:20.722,00:00:02.524,,,,,,,,,,"so eight would be the lowest common denominator",,,
00:21:20.722,00:21:26.908,00:00:06.186,,,,,,,,,,"so it would be three over eight times fourteen over eight (inaudible)",,,
00:21:26.908,00:21:33.443,00:00:06.535,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay three times fourteen twenty-eight thirty-two oh",
00:21:33.443,00:21:33.642,00:00:00.199,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:21:33.642,00:21:33.712,00:00:00.070,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:21:33.712,00:21:36.606,00:00:02.894,,,,,,,,,,"I think so",,,
00:21:36.646,00:21:40.776,00:00:04.130,,,,,,,,,,"so let me let me just check it",,,
00:21:40.776,00:21:44.248,00:00:03.472,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"okay I don't know why there's weird dots",
00:21:44.398,00:21:48.449,00:00:04.051,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"yeah I don't know why but okay",
00:21:48.449,00:21:48.908,00:00:00.459,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know",,,
00:21:48.908,00:21:52.869,00:00:03.961,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay I'm going to start y up here",
00:21:53.018,00:21:54.535,00:00:01.517,,,,,,,,,,"in forty-two",,,
00:21:54.655,00:21:55.383,00:00:00.728,,,,,,,,,,,,"forty or thirty",
00:21:55.942,00:22:00.412,00:00:04.470,,,,,,,,,,"forty-two because it will be four plus four plus four equals twelve",,,
00:22:00.412,00:22:01.798,00:00:01.386,,,,,,,,,,"so you carry a one",,,
00:22:01.798,00:22:06.368,00:00:04.570,,,,,,,,,,,,"what's forty-two over eight",
00:22:06.408,00:22:06.568,00:00:00.160,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:22:06.568,00:22:06.867,00:00:00.299,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",
00:22:06.867,00:22:09.441,00:00:02.574,,,,,,,,,,"so then eight would go into forty-two",,,
00:22:09.441,00:22:11.167,00:00:01.726,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay wait now that's I set this up wrong",
00:22:11.167,00:22:12.694,00:00:01.527,,,,,,,,,,,,"eight goes into forty-two what did you",
00:22:12.694,00:22:13.163,00:00:00.469,,,,,,,,,,"you go first",,,
00:22:13.163,00:22:28.598,00:00:15.435,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh I was going to ask if you bother anything",
00:22:28.598,00:22:31.671,00:00:03.073,,,,,,,,,,,,"because I'm still working on it",
00:22:31.671,00:22:33.636,00:00:01.965,,,,,,,,,,"so eight and eight equals sixteen",,,
00:22:33.636,00:22:38.605,00:00:04.969,,,,,,,,,,"sixteen plus eight equals twenty-four",,,
00:22:38.605,00:22:41.349,00:00:02.744,,,,,,,,,,"twenty-four plus eight equals thirty-two",,,
00:22:41.349,00:22:44.002,00:00:02.653,,,,,,,,,,"so then thirty-two plus eight equals forty",,,
00:22:44.002,00:22:46.696,00:00:02.694,,,,,,,,,,"so you can get the forty",,,
00:22:46.696,00:22:46.886,00:00:00.190,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",
00:22:46.886,00:22:48.622,00:00:01.736,,,,,,,,,,"so then it would be five times",,,
00:22:48.622,00:22:55.766,00:00:07.144,,,,,,,,,,,,"five times",
00:22:55.766,00:23:00.006,00:00:04.240,,,,,,,,,,"(laughter) I have no idea what to talk about",,,
00:23:00.395,00:23:02.920,00:00:02.525,,,,,,,,,,,,"me neither wait what's the surgery called again",

00:23:06.372,00:23:09.036,00:00:02.664,,,,,,,,,,"I guess that is called oral surgery",,,
00:23:09.036,00:23:11.520,00:00:02.484,,,,,,,,,,"because that's what it's considered",,,
00:23:11.560,00:23:13.366,00:00:01.806,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh well like are they going to numb it",

00:24:57.230,00:24:59.854,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah they possibly will",
00:24:59.904,00:25:06.698,00:00:06.794,,,,,,,,,,"because my teeth are connected to the bones",,,

00:41:31.919,00:41:41.308,00:00:09.389,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I'm just going to rewrite it four over k",

00:41:56.653,00:42:02.729,00:00:06.076,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh well so they get rid of the four",
00:42:02.849,00:42:04.385,00:00:01.536,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"that doesn't look like a four",

00:42:15.550,00:42:22.843,00:00:07.293,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay to get rid of the four two times four",
00:42:22.843,00:42:27.852,00:00:05.009,,,,,,,,,,"or no because it's not a minus four",,,
00:42:27.852,00:42:30.955,00:00:03.103,,,,,,,,,,"it's a four times four will be six",,,
00:42:30.955,00:42:33.180,00:00:02.225,,,,,,,,,,"and twelve four times four wouldn't be zero",,,
00:42:33.180,00:42:33.379,00:00:00.199,,,,,,,,,,,,"right right",
00:42:33.778,00:42:39.086,00:00:05.308,,,,,,,,,,"so you have to divide it this time",,,
00:42:39.086,00:42:41.100,00:00:02.014,,,,,,,,,,,,"divide it pause filler maybe",
00:42:42.040,00:42:46.021,00:00:03.981,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait four is being divided by k",
00:42:46.021,00:42:49.183,00:00:03.162,,,,,,,,,,"nah what did I write",,,
00:42:49.183,00:42:52.576,00:00:03.393,,,,,,,,,,"I didn't even write a seven",,,
00:42:52.576,00:42:54.451,00:00:01.875,,,,,,,,,,"go away seven",,,
00:42:54.451,00:42:55.419,00:00:00.968,,,,,,,,,,,,"and maybe you're right",
00:42:55.419,00:43:01.426,00:00:06.007,,,,,,,,,,"undo undo oh (laughter) the face is like an eight so four",,,
00:43:01.446,00:43:03.371,00:00:01.925,,,,,,,,,,"it's like a four equals",,,

00:43:56.002,00:43:58.486,00:00:02.484,,,,,,,,,,"so one minus that",,,
00:43:58.486,00:44:00.611,00:00:02.125,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait one second",
00:44:00.611,00:44:03.874,00:00:03.263,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm going to sign something might tell this",
00:44:05.700,00:44:08.453,00:00:02.753,,,,,,,,,,"so four oh (inaudible) scratch paper (laughter)",,,
00:44:08.453,00:44:12.594,00:00:04.141,,,,,,,,,,,,"see okay well I have (inaudible)",
00:44:12.843,00:44:19.528,00:00:06.685,,,,,,,,,,,,"and it's two over x equals twenty",
00:44:19.578,00:44:24.846,00:00:05.268,,,,,,,,,,,,"it says which is what we have right now",
00:44:24.846,00:44:28.228,00:00:03.382,,,,,,,,,,,,"and this is multiply both sides by x",
00:44:29.725,00:44:30.413,00:00:00.688,,,,,,,,,,"oh no no",,,
00:44:31.900,00:44:34.225,00:00:02.325,,,,,,,,,,,,"so if you multiply",
00:44:34.235,00:44:36.829,00:00:02.594,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait this is what we're supposed to do",
00:44:36.829,00:44:39.403,00:00:02.574,,,,,,,,,,,,"so as you multiply both sides by x",
00:44:39.453,00:44:40.022,00:00:00.569,,,,,,,,,,"got it",,,
00:44:40.830,00:44:41.947,00:00:01.117,,,,,,,,,,,,"you got it",
00:44:42.376,00:44:42.666,00:00:00.290,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:44:42.666,00:44:42.765,00:00:00.099,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",
00:44:42.765,00:44:45.020,00:00:02.255,,,,,,,,,,"because it would be twenty",,,
00:44:45.020,00:44:46.118,00:00:01.098,,,,,,,,,,,,"because this thing is",
00:44:46.138,00:44:49.380,00:00:03.242,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know if you're supposed to do that",
00:44:49.440,00:44:51.735,00:00:02.295,,,,,,,,,,,,"because it's the same set of",
00:44:51.735,00:44:54.209,00:00:02.474,,,,,,,,,,,,"its two over x equals twenty",
00:44:54.209,00:44:57.971,00:00:03.762,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then it says multiply both sides by x (inaudible)",
00:44:57.971,00:45:05.164,00:00:07.193,,,,,,,,,,"but we have the fifty-four to before the k plus fifty-four",,,
00:45:05.444,00:45:11.271,00:00:05.827,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah but that's the equation like we have right now like in the green",
00:45:12.418,00:45:14.663,00:00:02.245,,,,,,,,,,,,"so I don't know if that would tell",
00:45:15.451,00:45:19.053,00:00:03.602,,,,,,,,,,,,"but technically we would follow the same steps and then",
00:45:19.053,00:45:20.240,00:00:01.187,,,,,,,,,,"oh that's okay",,,
00:45:22.385,00:45:27.823,00:00:05.438,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so divided by x so then if we would divide it by k",
00:45:27.823,00:45:31.764,00:00:03.941,,,,,,,,,,,,"you would just be left with",
00:45:33.979,00:45:40.095,00:00:06.116,,,,,,,,,,,,"if we do it this way we would be left with",
00:45:40.095,00:45:41.023,00:00:00.928,,,,,,,,,,,,"was that four",
00:45:41.023,00:45:44.944,00:00:03.921,,,,,,,,,,"there would be no remainder",,,
00:45:44.944,00:45:45.000,00:00:00.056,,,,,,,,,,"there will be no remainder",,,
00:45:45.000,00:45:45.196,00:00:00.196,,,,,,,,,,"there will be no remainder",,"hmm",
00:45:45.196,00:45:47.149,00:00:01.953,,,,,,,,,,"there will be no remainder",,,
00:45:47.418,00:45:56.318,00:00:08.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"for that one okay I'm just going to real quick do it this way",
00:45:56.318,00:46:03.921,00:00:07.603,,,,,,,,,,,,"and see if you get the same answer",
00:46:03.921,00:46:10.745,00:00:06.824,,,,,,,,,,"well you see what I did",,,
00:46:10.745,00:46:13.120,00:00:02.375,,,,,,,,,,"so (laughter) yeah let's break (laughter)",,,
00:46:13.120,00:46:19.964,00:00:06.844,,,,,,,,,,,,"(inaudible) equals sixty-two k",
00:46:24.913,00:46:25.602,00:00:00.689,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,"nice snails",,,
00:46:26.579,00:46:28.196,00:00:01.617,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"thanks I only did one hand",

00:46:29.183,00:46:30.890,00:00:01.707,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I was too lazy okay",
00:46:30.890,00:46:31.518,00:00:00.628,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,"yeah that's me",,,
00:46:32.187,00:46:56.102,00:00:23.915,,,,,,,,,,,,"I know so divide both sides by twenty twenty sixty-two wait still worst sixty-two ever",
00:46:56.102,00:47:01.440,00:00:05.338,,,,,,,,,,,,"it says divide both sides by the number",
00:47:02.617,00:47:06.978,00:00:04.361,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then we just (inaudible)",
00:47:07.117,00:47:08.494,00:00:01.377,,,,,,,,,,,,"that makes no sense",
00:47:09.222,00:47:10.639,00:00:01.417,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh I guess that does",
00:47:10.639,00:47:22.562,00:00:11.923,,,,,,,,,,,,"then I get four over sixty-two equals k",
00:47:22.562,00:47:30.514,00:00:07.952,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you simplify the four over sixty-two by dividing it",
00:47:30.514,00:47:32.649,00:00:02.135,,,,,,,,,,,,"which is what we did here",
00:47:32.649,00:47:34.824,00:00:02.175,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you get one five five",
00:47:35.173,00:47:37.378,00:00:02.205,,,,,,,,,,,,"so like we got the same answers",
00:47:37.378,00:47:38.875,00:00:01.497,,,,,,,,,,,,"so this would be the answer",
00:47:39.643,00:47:42.118,00:00:02.475,,,,,,,,,,,,"but we did it different ways",
00:47:42.587,00:47:42.756,00:00:00.169,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:47:43.115,00:47:47.944,00:00:04.829,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay but I don't think it really matters at this point because",
00:47:48.314,00:47:51.047,00:00:02.733,,,,,,,,,,"(inaudible) (laughter) you made it a lot further last time",,,
00:47:51.746,00:47:52.035,00:00:00.289,,,,,,,,,,,,"huh",
00:47:52.055,00:47:55.298,00:00:03.243,,,,,,,,,,"you made it a lot further last time",,,
00:47:55.298,00:47:59.378,00:00:04.080,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay negative I think",
00:47:59.378,00:48:02.910,00:00:03.532,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait this is like",
00:48:02.980,00:48:08.588,00:00:05.608,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's like a first one",
00:48:08.588,00:48:14.783,00:00:06.195,,,,,,,,,,,,"but it's just the order is switched I think",
