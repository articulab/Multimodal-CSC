00:07:26.328,00:07:36.675,00:00:10.347,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you're going to have twenty minutes to help them work through as many problems as you can",,,,
00:07:36.934,00:07:42.531,00:00:05.597,,,,,,,,,,,,"so remember that you're not solving the problems yourself",,,,
00:07:42.531,00:07:52.259,00:00:09.728,,,,,,,,,,,,"you're just going to try to help her understand the problems better",,,,
00:07:52.339,00:07:56.330,00:00:03.991,,,,,,,,,,,,"and let's just use the stylus to circle or underline anything you need to",,,,
00:07:56.330,00:08:02.296,00:00:05.966,,,,,,,,,,,,"there's no pressure if you don't get through all of them though",,,,
00:08:02.296,00:08:08.173,00:00:05.877,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you can go ahead and get started",,,,
00:08:08.612,00:08:09.151,00:00:00.539,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler okay (laughter)",,
00:08:09.859,00:08:12.593,00:00:02.734,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so do you know how to do this",
00:08:12.593,00:08:13.990,00:00:01.397,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you've learned this in school right",
00:08:14.189,00:08:18.769,00:00:04.580,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so okay so yeah",,
00:08:18.769,00:08:21.912,00:00:03.143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the first thing is you want to get x alone",,
00:08:21.912,00:08:25.055,00:00:03.143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you want to get rid of those the three over seven pause filler",,
00:08:26.262,00:08:35.351,00:00:09.089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yes so then you would have to well on the sheet it was like saying that you would have to do seven x",
00:08:35.351,00:08:36.908,00:00:01.557,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but I guess that's not",
00:08:37.496,00:08:38.265,00:00:00.769,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well never mind",
00:08:39.103,00:08:41.896,00:00:02.793,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so there's like two ways to do this",,
00:08:41.956,00:08:45.458,00:00:03.502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you could either divide x plus three over seven",,
00:08:45.458,00:08:48.352,00:00:02.894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"or you could multiply it plus three over seven",,
00:08:49.579,00:08:52.333,00:00:02.754,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yes so you would have to divide it by three sevens",
00:08:53.151,00:08:56.543,00:00:03.392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah or we could multiply it by the reciprocal",,
00:08:57.062,00:08:58.159,00:00:01.097,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because that would also work",,
00:08:58.159,00:08:59.846,00:00:01.687,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because that would turn it into one",,
00:09:00.534,00:09:01.322,00:00:00.788,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah yeah",
00:09:02.041,00:09:03.398,00:00:01.357,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what do you think",
00:09:03.398,00:09:04.126,00:00:00.728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"what do you",
00:09:05.054,00:09:08.925,00:00:03.871,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I mean it all depends",,
00:09:09.035,00:09:11.759,00:00:02.724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"would you rather divide forty or",,
00:09:11.759,00:09:13.604,00:00:01.845,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"would you rather multiply over forty",,
00:09:13.604,00:09:17.755,00:00:04.151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"probably multiplying might be easier than dividing forty",,
00:09:17.934,00:09:20.828,00:00:02.894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right then teach me how to do that then",
00:09:22.454,00:09:27.463,00:00:05.009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay okay that's weird oh okay yeah",,
00:09:27.463,00:09:30.017,00:00:02.554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you would want to do is",,
00:09:30.017,00:09:34.696,00:00:04.679,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you would want to just put like forty over here",,
00:09:35.734,00:09:38.907,00:00:03.173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that works",,
00:09:38.907,00:09:44.614,00:00:05.707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you I guess you would want to write out forty if you're going to multiply that",,
00:09:44.863,00:09:49.543,00:00:04.680,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so then",
00:09:49.543,00:09:57.993,00:00:08.450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then pause filler if we're going to multiply it pause filler you're going to just write over here three over seven",,
00:09:57.993,00:10:00.009,00:00:02.016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"or seven over three yeah",,
00:10:00.009,00:10:01.406,00:00:01.397,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you want to do a reciprocal",,
00:10:01.515,00:10:01.855,00:00:00.340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:10:03.651,00:10:06.225,00:00:02.574,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and I assume you know how to multiply fractions right",,
00:10:06.783,00:10:09.896,00:00:03.113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I actually haven't learned this for like a year or two",
00:10:09.896,00:10:12.620,00:00:02.724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so just refresh me on it",
00:10:12.670,00:10:16.152,00:00:03.482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I kind of remember but",
00:10:16.382,00:10:19.495,00:00:03.113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler basically it's like multiplying normally except",,
00:10:19.574,00:10:25.621,00:00:06.047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you want to multiply the forty times seven and the one times three",,
00:10:26.149,00:10:28.384,00:00:02.235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay okay yeah yeah",
00:10:28.384,00:10:30.639,00:00:02.255,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you just multiply straight across so you get",,
00:10:31.248,00:10:32.166,00:00:00.918,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"two hundred eighty",
00:10:32.804,00:10:33.223,00:00:00.419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:10:36.725,00:10:40.277,00:00:03.552,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"over three right",
00:10:40.277,00:10:43.729,00:00:03.452,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then does that pause filler does that simplify",
00:10:44.737,00:10:45.406,00:00:00.669,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler no",,
00:10:46.134,00:10:47.451,00:00:01.317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",
00:10:47.531,00:10:51.701,00:00:04.170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"see pause filler I guess you could just say that",,
00:10:52.609,00:10:58.745,00:00:06.136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because it would be okay",,
00:10:58.745,00:11:04.333,00:00:05.588,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you know you probably know (inaudible) okay",,
00:11:04.333,00:11:05.570,00:00:01.237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right next up",
00:11:05.570,00:11:09.940,00:00:04.370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so now do you want to multiply from the reciprocal again",
00:11:10.080,00:11:11.147,00:00:01.067,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so fourteen",
00:11:11.496,00:11:11.885,00:00:00.389,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:11:13.592,00:11:18.201,00:00:04.609,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"time eight over three",
00:11:19.778,00:11:22.910,00:00:03.132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then that's over one so fourteen times eight",
00:11:24.188,00:11:25.894,00:00:01.706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh gosh what is fourteen times eight",
00:11:26.283,00:11:28.927,00:00:02.644,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"see pause filler seven time eight is fifty-six",,
00:11:28.927,00:11:31.890,00:00:02.963,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"fifty-six times two a hundred and twelve",,
00:11:32.429,00:11:34.205,00:00:01.776,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right thank you",
00:11:34.893,00:11:36.949,00:00:02.056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"over three",
00:11:37.607,00:11:37.966,00:00:00.359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:11:37.966,00:11:40.261,00:00:02.295,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so next up",
00:11:42.326,00:11:43.683,00:00:01.357,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so",
00:11:45.918,00:11:51.625,00:00:05.707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay yeah for this one this one you just have you're adding an extra step to it",,
00:11:51.625,00:11:55.137,00:00:03.512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so the first thing want to do is make sure y is alone on this",,
00:11:56.354,00:12:03.857,00:00:07.503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so you're adding eighteen to both sides",
00:12:04.775,00:12:09.355,00:00:04.580,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that will equal seventy right",
00:12:09.554,00:12:09.784,00:00:00.230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah",,
00:12:11.500,00:12:23.283,00:00:11.783,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,,,"so seventy negative two thirds y sorry my writing is so messy equals seventy",
00:12:25.229,00:12:36.124,00:00:10.895,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to do seventy times wait three",
00:12:36.184,00:12:37.770,00:00:01.586,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you wanted to make sure there's a three",,
00:12:37.770,00:12:49.005,00:00:11.235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah wait let me go back",
00:12:50.422,00:12:53.375,00:00:02.953,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay you want to just multiply",,
00:12:53.375,00:13:03.881,00:00:10.506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"seven times two equals (inaudible)",
00:13:07.453,00:13:13.729,00:00:06.276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then that would equal to one hundred five",
00:13:13.988,00:13:16.901,00:00:02.913,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah maybe you could probably just put a y equals",,
00:13:17.550,00:13:24.384,00:00:06.834,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so finally it's our y equals one hundred",
00:13:24.614,00:13:27.028,00:00:02.414,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"except one thing you forgot to do is",,
00:13:27.028,00:13:31.708,00:00:04.680,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm pretty sure the one o five would be a negative because yeah",,
00:13:32.326,00:13:34.910,00:00:02.584,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you know y was a negative so",,
00:13:34.910,00:13:39.809,00:00:04.899,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right next up",
00:13:41.505,00:13:46.324,00:00:04.819,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so same thing here",
00:13:46.903,00:13:47.262,00:00:00.359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:13:47.262,00:13:53.987,00:00:06.725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you would want to do minus thirteen on both sides",
00:13:54.705,00:14:06.379,00:00:11.674,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and that would equal one x equals thirty-one",
00:14:07.456,00:14:15.249,00:00:07.793,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"then thirty-one over three times two over one equals sixty-two",
00:14:15.608,00:14:15.897,00:00:00.289,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yep",,
00:14:18.930,00:14:24.308,00:00:05.378,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so would it be x equals sixty-two then",
00:14:24.308,00:14:25.555,00:00:01.247,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah as you said",,
00:14:26.144,00:14:30.524,00:00:04.380,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you can't really do you could divide it by one but that would still be a sixty-two",,
00:14:30.524,00:14:39.344,00:00:08.820,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay so this is a little bit different because it's like on the other side",
00:14:39.344,00:14:41.479,00:00:02.135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but it's still the same so",
00:14:41.689,00:14:42.178,00:00:00.489,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:14:42.178,00:14:52.594,00:00:10.416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"add sixteen to both sides so then you I'm just going to flip this around so three",
00:14:54.180,00:14:59.957,00:00:05.777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"actually I'm just going to go six over three equals",
00:14:59.957,00:15:05.285,00:00:05.328,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"my gosh it's not even showing up",
00:15:06.193,00:15:06.881,00:00:00.688,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's not",,
00:15:07.400,00:15:08.308,00:00:00.908,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait one second",
00:15:09.166,00:15:10.872,00:00:01.706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"this tip like lagging",
00:15:11.800,00:15:12.249,00:00:00.449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,
00:15:14.315,00:15:18.315,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"forty-seven over pause filler",
00:15:19.642,00:15:22.875,00:00:03.233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then oh gosh what's six times forty-seven",
00:15:22.875,00:15:25.599,00:00:02.724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler well one thing you could do let's see wait (inaudible)",,
00:15:25.599,00:15:35.965,00:00:10.366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I guess before you do that you maybe you could simplify pause filler the sixty over three to like two",,
00:15:36.534,00:15:37.412,00:00:00.878,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"that might help you",,
00:15:37.442,00:15:48.956,00:00:11.514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah so three over one so forty-seven time two equals pause filler fifty-four right",
00:15:50.422,00:16:00.559,00:00:10.137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well not times two forty-seven would be eighty but mostly fourteen ninety-four because it wouldn't",,
00:16:00.559,00:16:07.324,00:00:06.765,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so ninety-four and then pause filler",
00:16:07.324,00:16:11.505,00:00:04.181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"that would be over that would just be ninety-four",
00:16:11.505,00:16:13.620,00:00:02.115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so x equals ninety-four",
00:16:18.379,00:16:20.275,00:00:01.896,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I haven't done the reciprocal for a long time",
00:16:20.275,00:16:23.527,00:00:03.252,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that's why I'm just",
00:16:24.894,00:16:25.533,00:00:00.639,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,,,"it is fun",,
00:16:25.533,00:16:27.249,00:00:01.716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so big numbers now",
00:16:27.339,00:16:28.496,00:00:01.157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"minus",
00:16:30.691,00:16:31.010,00:00:00.319,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:16:31.429,00:16:32.607,00:00:01.178,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"forty-eight so",
00:16:32.607,00:16:43.003,00:00:10.396,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so you want to subtract",,
00:16:43.003,00:16:46.754,00:00:03.751,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"would that be forty-nine",
00:16:47.173,00:16:47.642,00:00:00.469,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:16:47.642,00:16:48.680,00:00:01.038,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",
00:16:51.204,00:17:00.942,00:00:09.738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so so that would be five over twelve there",
00:17:00.942,00:17:01.860,00:00:00.918,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:17:02.229,00:17:04.823,00:00:02.594,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"here I'm just going to",
00:17:13.494,00:17:14.082,00:00:00.588,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay",,
00:17:14.082,00:17:16.507,00:00:02.425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and that would be a y right (inaudible)",,
00:17:16.507,00:17:22.513,00:00:06.006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so forty-nine times five",
00:17:22.513,00:17:25.067,00:00:02.554,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,,,"I wish there was a calculator gosh",
00:17:25.167,00:17:25.786,00:00:00.619,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,,,"I know",,
00:17:26.853,00:17:37.579,00:00:10.726,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so nine times five equals pause filler forty-five sorry forty-five",
00:17:38.946,00:17:39.415,00:00:00.469,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"forty-five",,
00:17:39.415,00:17:42.617,00:00:03.202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and that equals to a hundred well",,
00:17:44.354,00:17:46.249,00:00:01.895,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"one hundred sixty-five",
00:17:47.297,00:17:48.833,00:00:01.536,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no wait that wait",,
00:17:49.023,00:17:50.909,00:00:01.886,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"forty-five does a hundred and forty-five",,
00:17:51.048,00:17:56.376,00:00:05.328,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because forty times five equals two hundred so",,
00:17:56.376,00:18:03.450,00:00:07.074,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"are you sure it's not a hundred sixty-five",
00:18:03.450,00:18:04.987,00:00:01.537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait maybe",,
00:18:04.987,00:18:08.120,00:00:03.133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh wait yeah it's forty-nine",,
00:18:08.479,00:18:13.208,00:00:04.729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah forty-nine times five equals five okay",,
00:18:14.545,00:18:18.346,00:00:03.801,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"that's like okay so that's your five right pause filler",,
00:18:19.164,00:18:20.681,00:00:01.517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you have four over pause filler",,
00:18:22.088,00:18:30.239,00:00:08.151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"then as you go like that because you have to have zero there",,
00:18:30.239,00:18:31.746,00:00:01.507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and that's yeah",,
00:18:31.746,00:18:39.867,00:00:08.121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so it would be two hundred forty-five and pause filler five (inaudible)",,
00:18:39.867,00:18:42.102,00:00:02.235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right next page",
00:18:42.531,00:18:44.008,00:00:01.477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh gosh all right",
00:18:44.098,00:18:50.334,00:00:06.236,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so this one is going to be plus sixty-one to both sides",
00:18:50.543,00:18:50.703,00:00:00.160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,
00:18:50.703,00:18:57.018,00:00:06.315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you also want to add the two ys y thing right",
00:18:57.168,00:18:58.425,00:00:01.257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because that's like (inaudible)",
00:18:58.425,00:18:59.323,00:00:00.898,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so yeah",,
00:18:59.323,00:19:04.511,00:00:05.188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because there is two ones I really want one",,
00:19:04.511,00:19:07.016,00:00:02.505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"what just happened",
00:19:07.016,00:19:07.534,00:00:00.518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait a minute",,
00:19:07.534,00:19:16.255,00:00:08.721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so would you really want to so wait which side would you want to have your y on before you do this",,
00:19:18.090,00:19:20.455,00:00:02.365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I guess this side",
00:19:20.455,00:19:22.091,00:00:01.636,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"like this side over here",
00:19:23.329,00:19:26.252,00:00:02.923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh so for that you'd have to subtract the y pause filler",,
00:19:26.761,00:19:31.600,00:00:04.839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no so that would be harder than adding the y over here",,
00:19:31.600,00:19:36.339,00:00:04.739,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because I guess if you add it over here then you would get pause filler",,
00:19:36.339,00:19:36.519,00:00:00.180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh wait (inaudible)",,
00:19:36.668,00:19:37.327,00:00:00.659,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"huh huh",,
00:19:38.215,00:19:46.197,00:00:07.982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I guess it doesn't make a difference",,
00:19:46.197,00:19:51.714,00:00:05.517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but the y would be you'd have the negative y if you do it this way",,
00:19:51.714,00:19:54.558,00:00:02.844,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"or you have a positive y if you did it that way",,
00:19:55.286,00:19:57.690,00:00:02.404,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that yeah it doesn't matter that much",,
00:19:57.910,00:19:59.017,00:00:01.107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so I guess yeah",,
00:19:59.975,00:20:03.557,00:00:03.582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"just work through the first step really quick because I'm confused just",
00:20:03.557,00:20:04.226,00:00:00.669,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm sorry",
00:20:05.014,00:20:07.079,00:00:02.065,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah pause filler",,
00:20:07.209,00:20:14.193,00:00:06.984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah not subtracting sixty-one I mean this one is like a smaller one so I mean",,
00:20:14.193,00:20:19.451,00:00:05.258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"usually we'll do the one that was smaller but it doesn't matter exactly",,
00:20:22.404,00:20:23.861,00:00:01.457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well this one is smaller right",
00:20:23.901,00:20:24.709,00:00:00.808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah so",
00:20:24.709,00:20:30.386,00:00:05.677,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I mean when I add the sixty-five just sixty-one yeah",,
00:20:32.192,00:20:34.048,00:00:01.856,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so twenty-five",
00:20:39.046,00:20:39.865,00:00:00.819,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"eight-six",,
00:20:39.954,00:20:40.274,00:00:00.320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:20:54.671,00:20:55.310,00:00:00.639,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,
00:20:55.679,00:20:57.205,00:00:01.526,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh wait no that's equals",
00:20:57.554,00:20:58.762,00:00:01.208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh my gosh",
00:20:59.360,00:20:59.969,00:00:00.609,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'll just",
00:21:00.418,00:21:06.594,00:00:06.176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then pause filler",
00:21:10.026,00:21:21.480,00:00:11.454,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you would sub you would oh so how do you add this then",
00:21:21.480,00:21:22.228,00:00:00.748,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because it's like",
00:21:22.997,00:21:23.476,00:00:00.479,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh wait",,
00:21:23.476,00:21:28.105,00:00:04.629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to get rid of the wait so now you want to subtract the y right",,
00:21:28.105,00:21:30.001,00:00:01.896,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you only have y on one side",,
00:21:30.549,00:21:32.874,00:00:02.325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and so if you got rid of that y",,
00:21:32.874,00:21:36.167,00:00:03.293,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"then you would have like a zero so",,
00:21:36.925,00:21:43.929,00:00:07.004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so would that be negative six over six y then",
00:21:43.929,00:21:44.049,00:00:00.120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler six",,
00:21:44.049,00:21:44.258,00:00:00.209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait",,
00:21:45.236,00:21:53.078,00:00:07.842,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"like what is going to get six over seven minus one",
00:21:53.078,00:21:54.844,00:00:01.766,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because y is one basically",
00:21:55.383,00:22:08.942,00:00:13.559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well so when you're subtracting that y the y pause filler is really just can be pause filler a negative seven over seven y right",,
00:22:08.942,00:22:19.528,00:00:10.586,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then it would just be a negative thirteen over seven y when you subtract them together",,
00:22:20.396,00:22:24.337,00:00:03.941,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",
00:22:24.337,00:22:24.417,00:00:00.080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so",
00:22:28.887,00:22:31.142,00:00:02.255,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then once you have that y",,
00:22:38.465,00:22:45.639,00:00:07.174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you have that",,
00:22:45.639,00:22:51.525,00:00:05.886,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you just want to multiply it by seven over thirteen",,
00:22:51.525,00:22:53.431,00:00:01.906,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,,,"mm-hmm that's lovely",,
00:22:54.469,00:22:58.140,00:00:03.671,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what's eighty-six times seven",
00:22:58.200,00:23:01.134,00:00:02.934,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I don't know",,
00:23:01.433,00:23:07.180,00:00:05.747,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay (inaudible) okay eight six times seven two two",,
00:23:07.180,00:23:18.185,00:00:11.005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and for the four (inaudible) six fifty-six plus four sixty-eight pause filler",,
00:23:18.185,00:23:22.455,00:00:04.270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"maybe six hundred and two",,
00:23:22.515,00:23:37.700,00:00:15.185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right that's so close so six hundred two and then pause filler that is over negative thirteen",
00:23:39.466,00:23:40.474,00:00:01.008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:23:40.474,00:23:49.563,00:00:09.089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"like I'm just going to go with that you know (laughter)",
00:23:50.481,00:23:52.537,00:00:02.056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"put a little negative sign then",,
00:23:53.175,00:23:55.031,00:00:01.856,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"there we go",,
00:23:55.031,00:23:59.002,00:00:03.971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right let's move onto the next one",
00:23:59.002,00:24:07.882,00:00:08.880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so let's just start off by adding a two",
00:24:19.984,00:24:23.726,00:00:03.742,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so this cancels out then it",
00:24:29.173,00:24:30.750,00:00:01.577,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you just have",,
00:24:30.750,00:24:35.329,00:00:04.579,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"one hundred yeah (laughter) so",
00:24:36.407,00:24:36.986,00:00:00.579,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you have",,
00:24:38.073,00:24:41.924,00:00:03.851,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"plus ten over third x",
00:24:41.924,00:24:45.776,00:00:03.852,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then negative eleven x is left over on the other side",
00:24:46.354,00:24:52.890,00:00:06.536,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so now you want to add eleven x right",
00:24:53.089,00:24:59.904,00:00:06.815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then would that be if you're adding eleven x would that be",
00:24:59.904,00:25:09.262,00:00:09.358,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler wait if you're adding wait if you're adding elevenx",,
00:25:09.701,00:25:13.732,00:00:04.031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"would that be eleven and then ten over three",
00:25:14.830,00:25:23.470,00:00:08.640,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay if you're going to do that then on the other side you have zero equals scribble",,
00:25:24.578,00:25:32.450,00:00:07.872,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you only want you want to have x on one side and the hundred on the other",,
00:25:32.769,00:25:36.411,00:00:03.642,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you don't want to do that",,
00:25:36.411,00:25:40.821,00:00:04.410,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you would either have to pause filler put the hundred on the other side or",,
00:25:40.821,00:25:44.203,00:00:03.382,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you would have to subtract your ten x (inaudible)",,
00:25:44.901,00:25:51.407,00:00:06.506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"do you get that",,
00:25:53.173,00:25:54.190,00:00:01.017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so pause filler",
00:25:54.190,00:26:02.042,00:00:07.852,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so which one would you rather do",,
00:26:02.072,00:26:05.235,00:00:03.163,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you could either subtract a hundred",,
00:26:05.694,00:26:08.019,00:00:02.325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"or you could subtract ten x",,
00:26:10.004,00:26:14.484,00:00:04.480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the ten x will probably have less steps in here because you already put a hundred on one side",,
00:26:14.484,00:26:17.966,00:00:03.482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so subtract ten x",
00:26:21.349,00:26:38.978,00:00:17.629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that would be negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three",
00:26:40.884,00:26:42.670,00:00:01.786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait wait pause filler",,
00:26:44.057,00:26:48.796,00:00:04.739,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it doesn't look right",,
00:26:49.265,00:26:50.442,00:00:01.177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"three x or three",
00:26:52.647,00:27:01.228,00:00:08.581,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well you pause filler wait one second sorry",,
00:27:01.557,00:27:03.523,00:00:01.966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's okay",
00:27:03.523,00:27:04.032,00:00:00.509,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait a minute pause filler",,
00:27:04.979,00:27:08.900,00:00:03.921,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm sorry I like zoned out for a couple second wait",,
00:27:08.900,00:27:12.422,00:00:03.522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you added the eleven x",,
00:27:12.422,00:27:15.376,00:00:02.954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"is that what you ended up doing",,
00:27:19.107,00:27:26.840,00:00:07.733,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I well then you say that you could subtract ten x from both sides",
00:27:26.840,00:27:28.227,00:00:01.387,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so is that what you did",,
00:27:28.386,00:27:28.785,00:00:00.399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so",
00:27:28.785,00:27:28.935,00:00:00.150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so",,
00:27:28.935,00:27:34.083,00:00:05.148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three",
00:27:34.083,00:27:34.562,00:00:00.479,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no no no",,
00:27:34.562,00:27:39.072,00:00:04.510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so your question is would it be a negative twenty-one x",,
00:27:39.800,00:27:41.945,00:00:02.145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you still have to divide it by three",,
00:27:41.945,00:27:42.823,00:00:00.878,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so I'm pretty sure it won't",,
00:27:43.103,00:27:45.388,00:00:02.285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but yeah I'm getting confused",,
00:27:45.687,00:27:48.131,00:00:02.444,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait no wait no",,
00:27:48.131,00:27:56.442,00:00:08.311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you can't do that yeah because pause filler yeah you can't put the divided by three thing underneath that because that wouldn't work",,
00:27:58.019,00:28:01.531,00:00:03.512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so ten over three",,
00:28:02.628,00:28:03.776,00:00:01.148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you would have to",
00:28:03.776,00:28:12.506,00:00:08.730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so your negative eleven x because negative eleven is like over one and",,
00:28:12.606,00:28:15.140,00:00:02.534,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wouldn't you multiply it by three x probably",
00:28:16.587,00:28:22.334,00:00:05.747,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well you're not trying to get rid well you're trying to get rid on that side by subtraction not multiplication",,
00:28:23.780,00:28:25.067,00:00:01.287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what you can do",,
00:28:25.067,00:28:25.965,00:00:00.898,,,,,,,,,,,,,"how did it go",,,
00:28:26.438,00:28:26.444,00:00:00.006,,"00",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:28:26.444,00:28:29.697,00:00:03.253,,"00",,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's going good",

00:28:39.694,00:28:42.518,00:00:02.824,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and in to the server pause filler",,,
00:28:42.817,00:28:45.671,00:00:02.854,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and it would be a few minutes so",,,

00:38:01.447,00:38:04.610,00:00:03.163,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"we're going to start off by multiplying by x on both sides",
00:38:05.508,00:38:12.532,00:00:07.024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you multiply it by x on the (inaudible)",,
00:38:12.532,00:38:16.653,00:00:04.121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well actually never mind",
00:38:17.182,00:38:18.030,00:00:00.848,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"that was wrong",
00:38:18.030,00:38:23.038,00:00:05.008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait I'm looking at the tutor worksheet",
00:38:33.205,00:38:35.700,00:00:02.495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you do multiply both sides by x okay",
00:38:35.729,00:38:41.456,00:00:05.727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so and so you multiply that by x",,
00:38:42.374,00:38:46.705,00:00:04.331,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"then you get one x over x",,
00:38:46.754,00:38:48.121,00:00:01.367,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that could be one",,
00:38:48.121,00:38:51.055,00:00:02.934,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah that would just be one no x on this side",
00:38:51.055,00:38:52.920,00:00:01.865,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"after you multiply on this side",
00:38:52.920,00:38:54.148,00:00:01.228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"after you multiply it by x",
00:38:54.148,00:38:56.662,00:00:02.514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it pause filler it cancels out the x",
00:38:56.662,00:38:59.216,00:00:02.554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then that would be twenty-five x",
00:38:59.815,00:39:06.400,00:00:06.585,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so then you divide it by twenty-five on both sides",,
00:39:07.228,00:39:07.587,00:00:00.359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,
00:39:15.320,00:39:21.356,00:00:06.036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so then you have x equals one over twenty-five",,
00:39:25.796,00:39:43.705,00:00:17.909,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right oh you all right okay",
00:39:43.705,00:39:47.726,00:00:04.021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to start off by adding seventeen",
00:39:47.726,00:39:48.763,00:00:01.037,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"now what do you do next",
00:39:48.763,00:39:51.308,00:00:02.545,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you add a number to the sides",
00:39:51.308,00:39:53.772,00:00:02.464,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay pause filler okay yeah it makes sense",,
00:39:53.772,00:39:55.917,00:00:02.145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you just add the seventeen",,
00:39:59.749,00:40:02.472,00:00:02.723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you would get eighty",,
00:40:02.472,00:40:06.763,00:00:04.291,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so negative three over y equals eighty",
00:40:11.861,00:40:14.844,00:00:02.983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"now you want to multiply it by y on both sides",
00:40:14.974,00:40:24.602,00:00:09.628,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so one pause filler negative three equals eighty-y",,
00:40:25.660,00:40:30.698,00:00:05.038,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"this you would want to divide it by y",,
00:40:30.698,00:40:36.675,00:00:05.977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no you would want to divide it by",,
00:40:36.675,00:40:38.051,00:00:01.376,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no you would want to divide by",,
00:40:38.051,00:40:38.451,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"eighty",
00:40:38.850,00:40:39.388,00:00:00.538,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"eighty",,
00:40:39.648,00:40:52.768,00:00:13.120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you would get y equals negative three over eighty",,
00:40:53.137,00:40:57.627,00:00:04.490,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,,,"that must be okay that was this is beautiful okay",,
00:40:57.627,00:40:59.383,00:00:01.756,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay next",,
00:41:02.187,00:41:09.759,00:00:07.572,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so two hundred ten equals negative fourteen over y",
00:41:09.759,00:41:12.862,00:00:03.103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"what do you think your first step is going to be",
00:41:12.862,00:41:15.746,00:00:02.884,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so you multiply it by y yeah",,
00:41:15.746,00:41:19.657,00:00:03.911,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that cancels that out on this side",
00:41:19.807,00:41:22.231,00:00:02.424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you can equal two hundred ten",
00:41:22.231,00:41:23.987,00:00:01.756,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you got negative yes",,
00:41:23.987,00:41:32.867,00:00:08.880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you get two hundred and ten y equals negative fourteen",,
00:41:33.076,00:41:43.363,00:00:10.287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so after you do that you pause filler want to divide everything by twenty-five",,
00:41:43.363,00:41:52.452,00:00:09.089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so you're left with y on one side",
00:41:54.388,00:41:59.476,00:00:05.088,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because the two hundred ten is canceled out",
00:41:59.676,00:42:07.199,00:00:07.523,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"mm-hmm and (inaudible) you're both uh-huh with seven (inaudible)",,
00:42:07.658,00:42:09.005,00:00:01.347,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,,,"that looks good",,
00:42:09.005,00:42:16.627,00:00:07.622,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so because this one",,
00:42:16.627,00:42:25.318,00:00:08.691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you want to start off by adding twenty-four to both sides",
00:42:25.318,00:42:40.553,00:00:15.235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then oh one hundred thirty-seven equals five over x",,
00:42:40.553,00:42:50.331,00:00:09.778,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then like the other ones you would want to multiply it by x",,
00:42:50.670,00:42:51.199,00:00:00.529,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"correct",
00:42:54.392,00:43:10.585,00:00:16.193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and one hundred thirty-seven x equals five divided by hundred thirty-seven",,
00:43:11.313,00:43:11.672,00:00:00.359,,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,,,"perfect",
00:43:11.832,00:43:26.419,00:00:14.587,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yup x equals pause filler one hundred thirty-seven yeah",,
00:43:26.419,00:43:28.454,00:00:02.035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you got it",
00:43:29.153,00:43:30.080,00:00:00.927,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay pause filler",,
00:43:30.180,00:43:32.754,00:00:02.574,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"next one",,
00:43:32.824,00:43:33.383,00:00:00.559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",
00:43:35.368,00:43:35.608,00:00:00.240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah",,
00:43:36.606,00:43:42.522,00:00:05.916,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right oh so this is different",
00:43:42.522,00:43:43.071,00:00:00.549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:43:43.071,00:43:46.513,00:00:03.442,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you negative thirty-nine is smaller",
00:43:46.513,00:43:56.630,00:00:10.117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you probably want to start off by adding thirty-nine to both sides",
00:43:56.810,00:43:57.827,00:00:01.017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler well yeah it makes sense",,
00:44:04.931,00:44:10.559,00:00:05.628,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so remember that seventeen over x and twelve over x are like terms",
00:44:10.988,00:44:17.543,00:00:06.555,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you probably want to subtract twelve x from both sides",
00:44:18.381,00:44:20.685,00:00:02.304,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay one second",,
00:44:20.685,00:44:22.252,00:00:01.567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"let me just get this up",,
00:44:22.252,00:44:27.520,00:00:05.268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"equals twelve x or soon not to be twelve x",,
00:44:27.610,00:44:33.476,00:00:05.866,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh it's twenty-one (inaudible) eighteen eighteen",,
00:44:33.975,00:44:45.679,00:00:11.704,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"we can subtract that to get pause filler five over x equals eighteen",,
00:44:45.998,00:44:46.886,00:00:00.888,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right yup",
00:44:46.886,00:44:56.295,00:00:09.409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"multiply it by x to get five pause filler equals eighteen x",,
00:44:56.295,00:45:04.855,00:00:08.560,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and we can divide by eighteen to get on with over here pause filler",,
00:45:06.511,00:45:10.762,00:00:04.251,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"five over eighteen equals x",,
00:45:10.901,00:45:16.588,00:00:05.687,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"that's so sloppy",,
00:45:16.738,00:45:17.157,00:00:00.419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and x",,
00:45:17.157,00:45:25.807,00:00:08.650,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so this one is very similar",
00:45:25.807,00:45:28.900,00:00:03.093,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so negative nine and two are smaller",
00:45:28.900,00:45:31.944,00:00:03.044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what would you do with that",
00:45:31.944,00:45:38.100,00:00:06.156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so you would want to you want to add it",,
00:45:38.379,00:45:45.064,00:00:06.685,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you get plus another ninety-two",,
00:45:45.064,00:46:00.519,00:00:15.455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay pause filler then you have three x equals pause filler a hundred and three plus twelve x",,
00:46:00.848,00:46:04.041,00:00:03.193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you want to subtract with twelve x",,
00:46:04.310,00:46:06.126,00:00:01.816,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"get rid of that until (inaudible)",,
00:46:06.126,00:46:08.341,00:00:02.215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well twelve over x remember",
00:46:08.760,00:46:09.837,00:00:01.077,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah (laughter)",,
00:46:10.097,00:46:13.040,00:00:02.943,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but it's okay you still subtract",
00:46:13.200,00:46:13.489,00:00:00.289,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"here",,
00:46:13.489,00:46:18.488,00:00:04.999,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but you should subtract pause filler three x right three over x first",
00:46:19.266,00:46:20.773,00:00:01.507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you did that one",,
00:46:20.773,00:46:26.889,00:00:06.116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it could be a zero equals a hundred three plus fifteen x",,
00:46:26.889,00:46:33.893,00:00:07.004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no because if you're subtracting pause filler three over x on from twelve",
00:46:34.302,00:46:40.328,00:00:06.026,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"then it would be pause filler nine over x like one hundred three",
00:46:40.328,00:46:44.479,00:00:04.151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah one second yeah",,
00:46:44.798,00:46:47.512,00:00:02.714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh well actually right you're right sorry",
00:46:47.512,00:46:48.450,00:00:00.938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,
00:46:48.450,00:46:49.627,00:00:01.177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you would subtract twelve x",
00:46:49.627,00:46:52.939,00:00:03.312,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because three x is on the other equal side of the",
00:46:52.939,00:46:58.926,00:00:05.987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so minus twelve x",,
00:46:58.926,00:47:07.097,00:00:08.171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that's a beautiful x (laughter)",,
00:47:07.297,00:47:14.530,00:00:07.233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you know being negative nine yeah negative yeah twelve over x",,
00:47:14.530,00:47:21.115,00:00:06.585,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and we got negative nine x equals a hundred and three",,
00:47:24.568,00:47:27.780,00:00:03.212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"that makes sense",,
00:47:27.810,00:47:29.167,00:00:01.357,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay and then",,
00:47:29.167,00:47:42.307,00:00:13.140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you divide by well you said you multiply I mean",
00:47:43.125,00:47:57.323,00:00:14.198,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I guess you could divide right pause filler maybe",,
00:47:57.323,00:48:04.666,00:00:07.343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think you could divide but pause filler multiply okay pause filler",,
00:48:05.864,00:48:10.064,00:00:04.200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"x wait no nine equals",,
00:48:10.064,00:48:12.439,00:00:02.375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"how do you get your screen to go lower",
00:48:12.439,00:48:14.165,00:00:01.726,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because I can't see what you're doing",

00:48:15.651,00:48:22.167,00:00:06.516,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"see how far can you see to what I'm doing",,
00:48:24.022,00:48:25.270,00:00:01.248,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can see",
00:48:25.599,00:48:29.171,00:00:03.572,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"here I'm going to write a bunch of numbers",,
00:48:29.171,00:48:30.617,00:00:01.446,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"tell me which ones you can see",,
00:48:30.617,00:48:32.014,00:00:01.397,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"can you see any of those",,
00:48:32.393,00:48:34.080,00:00:01.687,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can see one two three and four",
00:48:34.459,00:48:36.754,00:00:02.295,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you can't see five and six pause filler",,
00:48:36.754,00:48:42.580,00:00:05.826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay now I'll get rid of those pause filler okay pause filler",,
00:48:44.037,00:48:51.480,00:00:07.443,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"huh is your pause filler scribbler screen like fully like",,
00:48:51.480,00:48:55.052,00:00:03.572,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"is it from like one end to the screen all the way up to the other",,
00:48:56.419,00:49:01.607,00:00:05.188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well it is now because I've just made it bigger but it's",
00:49:01.607,00:49:05.827,00:00:04.220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"can you see nine equals one hundred threex",,
00:49:05.907,00:49:12.063,00:00:06.156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yes I wait it's okay",
00:49:12.063,00:49:13.001,00:00:00.938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"just keep working",
00:49:13.001,00:49:14.598,00:00:01.597,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can fix it",
00:49:16.603,00:49:17.271,00:00:00.668,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"just keep working",
00:49:17.271,00:49:17.700,00:00:00.429,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's okay",
00:49:18.259,00:49:23.577,00:00:05.318,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler ops one second I think pause filler oh actually a way to scroll down",,
00:49:23.577,00:49:28.067,00:00:04.490,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you can just probably use a scroll button pause filler",,
00:49:28.067,00:49:30.222,00:00:02.155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no that one",,
00:49:30.222,00:49:31.359,00:00:01.137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"like okay yeah okay pause filler yeah",,
00:49:31.359,00:49:32.956,00:00:01.597,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'll just try and go with it",,
00:49:34.123,00:49:42.414,00:00:08.291,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then I go pause filler one hundred and three x oh (laughter) pause filler",,
00:49:42.833,00:49:45.078,00:00:02.245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yes you divide a hundred and three",,
00:49:45.078,00:49:52.402,00:00:07.324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you got nine over a hundred and three equals x",,
00:49:53.000,00:49:57.430,00:00:04.430,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"there we go okay",,
00:49:58.947,00:50:01.311,00:00:02.364,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and next one",,
00:50:02.758,00:50:06.200,00:00:03.442,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so twenty-five is smaller",
00:50:06.200,00:50:23.351,00:00:17.151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to start up by subtracting that from both sides right",
00:50:23.541,00:50:23.690,00:00:00.149,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah",,
00:50:23.800,00:50:24.169,00:00:00.369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"come on (laughter)",,
00:50:24.169,00:50:29.507,00:00:05.338,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"that's sort of like I just want to know what that looks like",,
00:50:29.936,00:50:46.389,00:00:16.453,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"then got one over x no wait and then that will be plus thirty-five equals nine over x",,
00:50:49.671,00:50:53.762,00:00:04.091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then since you have that already",,
00:50:54.151,00:50:57.973,00:00:03.822,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you want to get rid of the one over x",,
00:50:58.282,00:51:00.377,00:00:02.095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and it's just the bottoms all (inaudible) is",,
00:51:00.377,00:51:01.664,00:00:01.287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you can just subtract that",,
00:51:01.664,00:51:04.099,00:00:02.435,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yes so you subtract one over x on both sides",
00:51:04.538,00:51:05.775,00:00:01.237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you would end up with",
00:51:06.753,00:51:09.716,00:00:02.963,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"thirty-five equals eight overx",,
00:51:10.045,00:51:20.202,00:00:10.157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you would want to multiply it by x on both sides to cancel out the x on this side",
00:51:20.202,00:51:24.432,00:00:04.230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well I was thinking pause filler since pause filler since the wait",,
00:51:24.742,00:51:27.007,00:00:02.265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you could try dividing by eight",,
00:51:27.007,00:51:29.641,00:00:02.634,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"do you think that would work",,
00:51:30.040,00:51:37.193,00:00:07.153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well on my tutor sheet it doesn't say anything about dividing by eight so",
00:51:38.441,00:51:43.958,00:00:05.517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think you would just I think that it would just pause filler give you extra steps that you don't plan",
00:51:44.337,00:51:51.950,00:00:07.613,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well maybe well I guess if you multiply if you divide it by x when you just have x right x by itself",,
00:51:53.446,00:51:55.801,00:00:02.355,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no because it's dividing anyway",
00:51:55.801,00:51:57.966,00:00:02.165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"like eight it is divided by x anyway so pause filler",
00:51:58.665,00:52:01.049,00:00:02.384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you would have to multiply it or something",
00:52:01.079,00:52:02.516,00:00:01.437,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but it just it's pause filler",
00:52:05.459,00:52:06.547,00:00:01.088,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,
00:52:06.597,00:52:12.673,00:00:06.076,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it would be too complicated I guess",
00:52:12.673,00:52:18.869,00:00:06.196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"on all of the things it says to",
00:52:20.565,00:52:20.794,00:00:00.229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,
00:52:20.954,00:52:26.531,00:00:05.577,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait so then you get thirty-five x equals eight",,
00:52:26.531,00:52:30.243,00:00:03.712,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"or so we just divide it by thirty-five",,
00:52:30.243,00:52:40.579,00:00:10.336,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you get x equals like could you see that stuff on the bottom I was doing",,
00:52:40.579,00:52:41.158,00:00:00.579,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler no I couldn't",
00:52:41.158,00:52:43.812,00:00:02.654,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but I can see what you're doing right now",
00:52:43.812,00:52:49.409,00:00:05.597,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay x equals eight over thirty-five pause filler",,
00:52:49.469,00:52:57.182,00:00:07.713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but on this problem could you just draw a line at the bottom of the page that where you can see",,
00:52:57.182,00:52:57.890,00:00:00.708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:53:01.063,00:53:03.178,00:00:02.115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay that way",,
00:53:03.178,00:53:04.066,00:00:00.888,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right wait",
00:53:04.335,00:53:08.376,00:00:04.041,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay pause filler",,
00:53:08.945,00:53:14.223,00:00:05.278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you can see all the stuff",,
00:53:15.510,00:53:21.696,00:00:06.186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so you're going to start off by subtracting twenty-two",
00:53:22.434,00:53:29.658,00:00:07.224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you get a hundred and three",,
00:53:31.095,00:53:31.314,00:00:00.219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",
00:53:31.753,00:53:36.562,00:00:04.809,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"plus ten x and then ninex",,
00:53:36.562,00:53:37.251,00:00:00.689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",
00:53:37.251,00:53:44.953,00:00:07.702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then pause filler yeah you're going to get rid of the tenx",,
00:53:45.113,00:53:48.754,00:00:03.641,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you probably want to subtract",
00:53:48.814,00:54:10.216,00:00:21.402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so then you get a hundred three equals pause filler negative onex",,
00:54:10.216,00:54:32.395,00:00:22.179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so then you want to multiply",
00:54:32.395,00:54:34.800,00:00:02.405,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I was just trying something out",,
00:54:34.800,00:54:38.581,00:00:03.781,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because if you multiply that by negative one x",,
00:54:41.335,00:54:48.708,00:00:07.373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then it would be negative one right over negative one x right",,
00:54:51.043,00:54:55.094,00:00:04.051,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you could cancel out the negative one",,
00:54:55.942,00:54:59.554,00:00:03.612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well if you see look at number nine on here",
00:55:00.621,00:55:03.125,00:00:02.504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"this is like a really similar problem",
00:55:03.125,00:55:04.971,00:00:01.846,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you can kind of see what they're doing",
00:55:05.490,00:55:09.451,00:00:03.961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's not really like",
00:55:09.451,00:55:12.544,00:00:03.093,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yes I mean it just seems like you would get rid of the step",,
00:55:12.544,00:55:15.108,00:00:02.564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but really it's just do those stuff",,
00:55:15.407,00:55:18.810,00:00:03.403,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to multiply by the x hundred and three",,
00:55:18.810,00:55:22.611,00:00:03.801,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you get x equals one over (inaudible)",,
00:55:23.719,00:55:24.547,00:00:00.828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait okay pause filler",,
00:55:24.756,00:55:38.355,00:00:13.599,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well you still have to divide it by negative one",
00:55:41.039,00:55:45.419,00:00:04.380,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you multiply that on both sides and then pause filler",
00:55:49.081,00:55:50.468,00:00:01.387,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah actually you divide it",,
00:55:50.468,00:55:54.179,00:00:03.711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"then the step would be on the other side to just divide",,
00:55:54.299,00:55:55.437,00:00:01.138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you get x by itself",,
00:55:55.437,00:55:57.592,00:00:02.155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you have to divide negative three by negative one",,
00:55:58.599,00:55:59.837,00:00:01.238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay all right",
00:55:59.837,00:56:02.530,00:00:02.693,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler but is that the same thing",,
00:56:02.530,00:56:03.339,00:00:00.809,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't think so pause filler",,
00:56:03.339,00:56:03.847,00:00:00.508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I doubt it",
00:56:03.847,00:56:04.087,00:00:00.240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,
00:56:04.456,00:56:13.984,00:00:09.528,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so let's pause filler one ninety",
00:56:15.381,00:56:25.758,00:00:10.377,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"what's ninety what's one ninety there we go yeah",
00:56:25.758,00:56:30.696,00:00:04.938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then I would want to yeah",
00:56:30.806,00:56:32.911,00:00:02.105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh this is a big number pause filler",
00:56:32.911,00:56:40.295,00:00:07.384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you got negative five over x equals",
00:56:41.721,00:56:41.871,00:00:00.150,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so",,,
00:56:41.871,00:56:45.662,00:00:03.791,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so you're done with the tutoring portion (inaudible)",,,,
