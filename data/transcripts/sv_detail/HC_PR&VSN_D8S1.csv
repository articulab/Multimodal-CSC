00:11:01.800,00:11:11.400,00:00:09.600,,,,,,,,,,,"and then so you have thirteen p equals fifty",,,
00:11:11.400,00:11:21.600,00:00:10.200,,,,,,,,,,,"and you got thirteen pause filler end up with p equals fifty divided by thirteen",,,

00:14:24.800,00:14:28.000,00:00:03.200,,,,,,,,,,,"it just matters where you pause filler",,,
00:14:28.800,00:14:32.800,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,,"I mean you just want to have the k by itself on one side",,,
00:14:33.500,00:14:42.200,00:00:08.700,,,,,,,,,,,"and so what you want to try to do is you want to get",,,
00:14:42.200,00:14:44.800,00:00:02.600,,,,,,,,,,,"oops sorry you want to get this",,,
00:14:44.900,00:14:49.200,00:00:04.300,,,,,,,,,,,"oops you want to get this over here",,,
00:14:50.300,00:14:54.300,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,,"and you want to get that fifteen over here",,,
00:14:55.200,00:14:58.500,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,,"and so basically when you're working with these you want to pause filler you pause filler",,,
00:14:58.500,00:15:07.400,00:00:08.900,,,,,,,,,,,"it's kind of like an inverse operations inverse order of operations type of thing",,,
00:15:07.400,00:15:13.700,00:00:06.300,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to do addition or subtraction first and then multiplication or division",,,
00:15:14.700,00:15:35.600,00:00:20.900,,,,,,,,,,,"so you're going to start with getting the twenty-two to the other side and then dividing by fifteen",,,
00:15:37.000,00:15:38.900,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"(inaudible) should just give us the (inaudible)",,
00:15:38.900,00:15:46.500,00:00:07.600,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah or maybe it's like some kind of test or something",,,
00:15:46.700,00:15:50.600,00:00:03.900,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so here we have a negative number here",,,
00:15:51.400,00:15:53.700,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to add it",,,
00:15:53.700,00:15:55.900,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you have a multiplication",,,
00:15:55.900,00:15:59.000,00:00:03.100,,,,,,,,,,,"you want to give so multiply",,,
00:15:59.000,00:16:05.900,00:00:06.900,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to divide it",,,
00:16:06.600,00:16:11.300,00:00:04.700,,,,,,,,,,,"and so this is first",,,
00:16:11.300,00:16:12.900,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,,"and then this is second",,,
00:16:12.900,00:16:42.200,00:00:29.300,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"well it is making me mad",,
00:16:42.200,00:16:51.400,00:00:09.200,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay so let's do this together",,,
00:16:51.400,00:16:54.500,00:00:03.100,,,,,,,,,,,"so we have twenty-two and some negative",,,
00:16:54.800,00:16:59.900,00:00:05.100,,,,,,,,,,,"so we want to add twenty-two to both sides so",,,
00:17:00.300,00:17:03.200,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,,"and that gets rid of this twenty-two",,,
00:17:03.200,00:17:11.300,00:00:08.100,,,,,,,,,,,"and that makes this sixty-two courtesy of this fifteen right here",,,
00:17:12.300,00:17:14.400,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,"and since it's multiplied b k",,,
00:17:14.400,00:17:15.800,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,"you want to divide it",,,
00:17:17.000,00:17:22.200,00:00:05.200,,,,,,,,,,,"so you divide sixty-two by fifteen",,,
00:17:23.100,00:17:24.200,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,"and that equals k",,,
00:17:26.300,00:17:35.300,00:00:09.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"what then k equals pause filler",,
00:17:35.900,00:17:37.600,00:00:01.700,,,,,,,,,,,"k equals sixty-two",,,
00:17:37.600,00:17:44.200,00:00:06.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"k equals sixty-two sixty-two divided by five is like four",,
00:17:44.200,00:17:48.400,00:00:04.200,,,,,,,,,,,"it's divided by fifteen",,,
00:17:48.400,00:17:49.600,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,,"and it's about four yeah",,,
00:17:50.500,00:17:51.300,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,"UL",,,,"so that's good",,,
00:17:51.400,00:17:58.500,00:00:07.100,,,,,,,,,,,"it's four and two fifteens okay so next question",,,
00:18:00.500,00:18:04.800,00:00:04.300,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so this one is also pretty easy",,,
00:18:04.900,00:18:13.900,00:00:09.000,,,,,,,,,,,"so that's one of the easier ones",,,
00:18:13.900,00:18:14.400,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"there's three",,
00:18:15.200,00:18:15.900,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,,"what",,,
00:18:15.900,00:18:16.500,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"three",,
00:18:16.900,00:18:30.700,00:00:13.800,,,,,,,"UL",,,,"yeah awesome great next question okay that is",,,
00:18:30.700,00:18:31.500,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"three again",,
00:18:31.800,00:18:46.000,00:00:14.200,,,,,,,"UL",,,,"three yeah well great okay pause filler question is okay",,,
00:18:47.700,00:18:50.800,00:00:03.100,,,,,,,,,,,"so you have k on both sides",,,
00:18:50.800,00:18:55.100,00:00:04.300,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to get both of the Ks just to one side",,,
00:18:55.600,00:18:58.300,00:00:02.700,,,,,,,,,,,"and since you have more Ks over here",,,
00:18:58.300,00:19:00.700,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,,"you want to get rid of this k",,,
00:19:01.800,00:19:05.600,00:00:03.800,,,,,,,,,,,"so since if there's no positive or negative sign next to it",,,
00:19:05.600,00:19:07.800,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,,"that means it's positive",,,
00:19:09.200,00:19:12.100,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,,"so you would subtract k from both sides",,,
00:19:13.500,00:19:20.900,00:00:07.400,,,,,,,,,,,"and so you would have negative ten equals seven k minus sixty-eight",,,
00:19:21.200,00:19:40.500,00:00:19.300,,,,,,,,,,,"and then can you work out from there",,,
00:19:40.500,00:19:43.300,00:00:02.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"mm-hmm like add something",,
00:19:43.400,00:19:45.500,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so let's close it",,,
00:19:45.700,00:19:49.900,00:00:04.200,,,,,,,,,,,"so this is negative",,,
00:19:50.000,00:19:51.600,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,,"we want to add it to both sides",,,
00:19:51.600,00:19:52.800,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,,"so since this is",,,
00:19:53.200,00:19:55.500,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,,"so you add sixty-eight to both sides",,,
00:19:56.400,00:19:59.100,00:00:02.700,,,,,,,,,,,"and so you have negative ten on this side",,,
00:20:00.000,00:20:04.800,00:00:04.800,,,,,,,,,,,"so that's basically saying sixty-eight plus negative ten is also right",,,
00:20:05.600,00:20:11.000,00:00:05.400,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah sixty-eight minus ten is negative ten plus sixty-eight",,,
00:20:11.200,00:20:21.100,00:00:09.900,,,,,,,,,,,"so you have sixty-eight minus ten equals seven k",,,
00:20:22.200,00:20:29.200,00:00:07.000,,,,,,,,,,,"and so you have fifty-eight equals seven k",,,
00:20:30.100,00:20:34.400,00:00:04.300,,,,,,,,,,,"so can you do that",,,
00:20:34.900,00:20:36.600,00:00:01.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"mm-hmm so fifty-eight minus seven k",,
00:20:37.800,00:20:39.700,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,"fifty-eight equals seven k",,,
00:20:39.770,00:20:39.800,00:00:00.030,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:20:39.800,00:20:49.400,00:00:09.600,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"so my handwriting is (inaudible)",,,

00:20:49.600,00:21:17.400,00:00:27.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"four something oh that equals",,
00:21:19.100,00:21:21.900,00:00:02.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think it's like eight around eight",,
00:21:22.200,00:21:29.200,00:00:07.000,,,,,,,"UL",,,,"yup yeah that's exactly eight awesome",,,
00:21:30.100,00:21:33.400,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,,"so that is ten questions",,,
00:21:35.700,00:21:41.800,00:00:06.100,,,,,,,"UL",,,,"so there we go awesome",,,
00:21:44.000,00:21:46.200,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,,"so now we kind of just wait",,,

00:26:07.500,00:26:15.600,00:00:08.100,,,,,,,,,,,"so let's just pause filler",,,
00:26:16.900,00:26:19.000,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,"we should remember what our signs are",,,
00:26:19.500,00:26:20.600,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,"this is the negative",,,
00:26:20.600,00:26:21.700,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,"this is the negative",,,
00:26:22.200,00:26:23.600,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,"this is the positive",,,
00:26:24.000,00:26:24.800,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,,"that's a positive",,,
00:26:24.800,00:26:42.400,00:00:17.600,,,,,,,,,,,"so you can try to do that oh",,,
00:26:43.100,00:26:44.600,00:00:01.500,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"oh my gosh this mouse (inaudible)",,

00:26:57.100,00:27:03.400,00:00:06.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know none of this",,
00:27:03.900,00:27:11.300,00:00:07.400,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so here so you want to get the r on just one side",,,
00:27:11.600,00:27:14.300,00:00:02.700,,,,,,,,,,,"so since you have less r on here",,,
00:27:14.300,00:27:15.000,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,,"you just have one r",,,
00:27:15.000,00:27:17.000,00:00:02.000,,,,,,,,,,,"so you subtract r from this side",,,
00:27:18.700,00:27:20.000,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,"and subtract r from that side",,,
00:27:20.000,00:27:24.200,00:00:04.200,,,,,,,,,,,"and you have negative thirty-three equals r",,,
00:27:24.200,00:27:26.400,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,,"because you subtract to one",,,
00:27:26.400,00:27:29.800,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that's it for this half",
00:27:29.800,00:27:30.500,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"for this for",,
00:27:30.700,00:27:35.600,00:00:04.900,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler the study so pause filler you're finished being tutored",
