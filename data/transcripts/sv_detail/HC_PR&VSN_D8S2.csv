00:06:36.871,00:06:39.554,00:00:02.683,,,,,,,,,,,,"so again these are kind of the logic behind",
00:06:40.053,00:06:41.300,00:00:01.247,,,,,,,,,,,,"but not the same numbers",
00:06:43.116,00:06:46.818,00:00:03.702,,,,,,,,,,,"okay oh we've got one to ten again",,

00:06:58.112,00:07:00.736,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right okay",
00:07:00.736,00:07:08.409,00:00:07.673,,,,,,,,,,"okay so we'll start with the mouse this time",,,
00:07:08.409,00:07:12.051,00:00:03.642,,,,,,,,,,,,"awesome so can we start",
00:07:12.230,00:07:12.529,00:00:00.299,,,,,,,,,,"yes",,,
00:07:12.799,00:07:19.334,00:00:06.535,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay do you know how to do this",
00:07:19.354,00:07:22.088,00:00:02.734,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I think so",,
00:07:34.090,00:07:34.619,00:00:00.529,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",
00:07:35.118,00:07:36.744,00:00:01.626,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't think you got a whole number",
00:07:36.854,00:07:40.187,00:00:03.333,,,,,,,,,,,,"so just like whatever the fraction is at the end",
00:07:40.187,00:07:42.062,00:00:01.875,,,,,,,,,,,"wouldn't it be like four or something",,
00:07:43.180,00:07:48.167,00:00:04.987,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh I think so because you have so when we divide it by three",
00:07:48.167,00:07:48.168,00:00:00.001,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,"oh I think so because you have so when we divide it by three",
00:07:48.168,00:07:52.399,00:00:04.231,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"it sounds I can't right on these",
00:07:52.399,00:07:52.405,00:00:00.006,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler you actually are multiplying it by seven over three",
00:07:52.405,00:07:58.914,00:00:06.509,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler you actually are multiplying it by seven over three",
00:07:59.004,00:07:59.612,00:00:00.608,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you have",
00:08:00.530,00:08:04.551,00:00:04.021,,,,,,,,,,,,"I should get rid of this",
00:08:04.591,00:08:10.687,00:00:06.096,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler forty times seven over three",
00:08:12.912,00:08:13.700,00:00:00.788,,,,,,,,,,,,"equals x",
00:08:14.738,00:08:18.609,00:00:03.871,,,,,,,,,,,,"so x equals two hundred",
00:08:20.276,00:08:22.351,00:00:02.075,,,,,,,,,,,"so what it would be ninety-three",,
00:08:22.351,00:08:24.715,00:00:02.364,,,,,,,,,,,,"it would be over three",
00:08:24.715,00:08:31.211,00:00:06.496,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler it doesn't I don't think it goes into three equally",
00:08:31.211,00:08:32.987,00:00:01.776,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you just have this is the answer",
00:08:36.249,00:08:36.898,00:00:00.649,,,,,,,,,,,"two eighty",,
00:08:37.217,00:08:38.275,00:00:01.058,,,,,,,,,,,,"two eighty over three",
00:08:39.133,00:08:41.148,00:00:02.015,,,,,,,,"UL",,,"perfect pause filler I get it now",,
00:08:41.348,00:08:44.451,00:00:03.103,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay so next pause filler same idea",
00:08:45.019,00:08:45.458,00:00:00.439,,,,,,,,,,,"yes",,
00:08:46.147,00:09:00.644,00:00:14.497,,,,,,,,,,,,"so the next one would be",
00:09:19.002,00:09:19.770,00:00:00.768,,,,,,,,,,,"right",,
00:09:19.770,00:09:20.978,00:00:01.208,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,"yup perfect",
00:09:21.626,00:09:22.075,00:00:00.449,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,"awesome",
00:09:22.075,00:09:22.434,00:00:00.359,,,,,,,,,,,,"let's go",
00:09:22.434,00:09:25.268,00:00:02.834,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so this one is two-step",
00:09:25.268,00:09:26.994,00:00:01.726,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's pretty simple",
00:09:31.364,00:09:41.102,00:00:09.738,,,,,,,,,,,"so it would be two times eighteen",,
00:09:41.890,00:09:42.110,00:00:00.220,,,,,,,,,,,,"no",
00:09:42.110,00:09:48.295,00:00:06.185,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what you do is you add eighteen to both sides to get rid of it first",
00:09:49.064,00:09:58.093,00:00:09.029,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you have seventy on this side and negative two thirds y",
00:09:58.093,00:10:01.476,00:00:03.383,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you just do the same thing except this part is negative",
00:10:05.037,00:10:21.710,00:00:16.673,,,,,,,,,,,"this would be one forty negative one forty",,
00:10:23.136,00:10:24.024,00:00:00.888,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yes wait no",
00:10:24.344,00:10:25.770,00:00:01.426,,,,,,,,,,,"it's positive",,
00:10:26.588,00:10:29.173,00:00:02.585,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh two ten",
00:10:29.173,00:10:29.442,00:00:00.269,,,,,,,,,,,"so (inaudible)",,
00:10:29.442,00:10:39.759,00:00:10.317,,,,,,,,,,,,"no no no because you do pause filler because when you divide this you have to multiply it by the reciprocal or three over two",
00:10:40.118,00:10:42.622,00:00:02.504,,,,,,,,,,,,"so it's seventy times three divided by two",
00:10:44.318,00:10:46.912,00:00:02.594,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that's two hundred ten divided by two",
00:10:48.120,00:10:53.258,00:00:05.138,,,,,,,,,,,"twenty-two",,
00:10:54.744,00:11:07.096,00:00:12.352,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you got in the end one hundred five",
00:11:07.400,00:11:07.416,00:00:00.016,"(inaudible)",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:11:07.416,00:11:18.630,00:00:11.214,"(inaudible)",,,,,,,,,,,"yeah times don't mind what's right there but okay",
00:11:18.630,00:11:18.644,00:00:00.014,"(inaudible)",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:11:22.581,00:11:23.150,00:00:00.569,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",
00:11:23.180,00:11:23.569,00:00:00.389,,,,,,,,,,,"thirteen oh",,
00:11:23.569,00:11:28.438,00:00:04.869,,,,,,,,,,,"so do we still add thirteen to both sides",,
00:11:28.438,00:11:28.498,00:00:00.060,,,,,,,,,,,,"no",
00:11:28.498,00:11:35.402,00:00:06.904,,,,,,,,,,,,"since this is positive you subtract thirteen to both sides",
00:11:38.256,00:12:04.037,00:00:25.781,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you want to get rid of this",
00:12:04.845,00:12:08.357,00:00:03.512,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's thirty-one",
00:12:09.245,00:12:09.774,00:00:00.529,,,,,,,,,,,"is it",,
00:12:10.482,00:12:10.712,00:00:00.230,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:12:12.308,00:12:12.588,00:00:00.280,,,,,,,,,,,"oh",,
00:12:17.746,00:12:19.731,00:00:01.985,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay seven times that equals",
00:12:22.415,00:12:25.448,00:00:03.033,,,,,,,,,,,,"one half x",
00:12:25.448,00:12:41.053,00:00:15.605,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then this is as simple as just x equals two one times thirty-one",
00:12:41.173,00:12:45.044,00:00:03.871,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what does x equal",
00:12:45.383,00:12:46.550,00:00:01.167,,,,,,,,,,,"x equal",,
00:12:50.042,00:12:52.796,00:00:02.754,,,,,,,,,,,"okay x equals",,
00:12:52.796,00:12:53.924,00:00:01.128,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler is that multiply",,
00:12:54.383,00:12:55.370,00:00:00.987,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah it's multiply sorry",
00:13:01.536,00:13:02.464,00:00:00.928,,,,,,,,,,,"sixty-two",,
00:13:02.604,00:13:02.853,00:00:00.249,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:13:04.200,00:13:07.024,00:00:02.824,,,,,,,,,,,"x equals",,
00:13:10.077,00:13:11.055,00:00:00.978,,,,,,,"UL",,,,,"awesome",
00:13:11.055,00:13:16.732,00:00:05.677,,,,,,,,,,,"they just like to come before",,
00:13:16.732,00:13:20.713,00:00:03.981,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and that's basically the same idea",
00:13:22.259,00:13:25.871,00:00:03.612,,,,,,,,,,,,"since this is negative you are adding this time",
00:13:28.754,00:13:52.959,00:00:24.205,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler six time thirty-one",,
00:13:54.586,00:13:54.845,00:00:00.259,,,,,,,,,,,"wow",,

00:13:57.200,00:14:02.488,00:00:05.288,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and this one kind of sucks because you have to multiply that by",
00:14:04.044,00:14:04.763,00:00:00.719,,,,,,,,,,,"nineteen",,
00:14:04.832,00:14:07.666,00:00:02.834,,,,,,,,,,,"so this is nineteen over six",,
00:14:07.846,00:14:08.724,00:00:00.878,,,,,,,,,,,,"what",
00:14:09.103,00:14:11.817,00:00:02.714,,,,,,,,,,,"is it nineteen over six",,
00:14:11.986,00:14:17.703,00:00:05.717,,,,,,,,,,,,"no because when you're adding it this is not affected by that",
00:14:18.422,00:14:26.503,00:00:08.081,,,,,,,,,,,,"so when you add sixteen here it only affects that",
00:14:26.932,00:14:29.017,00:00:02.085,,,,,,,,,,,,"so it only just gets rid of that",
00:14:29.017,00:14:35.862,00:00:06.845,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you have forty-seven equals three six time x",
00:14:38.556,00:14:42.776,00:00:04.220,,,,,,,,,,,"so forty-six times three over forty-seven times three",,
00:14:43.674,00:14:50.120,00:00:06.446,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's forty-seven times six because you're dividing by three",
00:14:50.968,00:14:58.321,00:00:07.353,,,,,,,,,,,,"six plus means you're multiplying by six thirds",
00:15:06.812,00:15:14.025,00:00:07.213,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and then that is all over three",,
00:15:14.903,00:15:15.911,00:00:01.008,,,,,,,,,,,"six",,
00:15:16.080,00:15:16.260,00:00:00.180,,,,,,,,,,,,"three",
00:15:16.260,00:15:20.750,00:00:04.490,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you have times yeah",
00:15:22.695,00:15:25.459,00:00:02.764,,,,,,,,,,,,"and that should go in equally yeah",
00:15:29.909,00:15:36.424,00:00:06.515,,,,,,,,,,,"that's the (inaudible) one",,
00:15:36.902,00:15:36.923,00:00:00.021,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,

00:15:44.336,00:15:44.835,00:00:00.499,,,,,,,,,,,,"let's see",
00:15:45.144,00:15:47.918,00:00:02.774,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler since this is positive we're going to subtract that",
00:15:48.307,00:15:51.440,00:00:03.133,,,,,,,,,,,,"and we're going to get a negative answer because that's negative",
00:15:53.166,00:15:55.750,00:00:02.584,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to do this part",
00:15:55.750,00:15:57.995,00:00:02.245,,,,,,,,,,,"ninety-seven minus eighteen",,
00:15:58.754,00:15:59.512,00:00:00.758,,,,,,,,,,,,"minus forty-eight",
00:15:59.512,00:16:01.837,00:00:02.325,,,,,,,,,,,"oh it's minus forty-eight",,
00:16:01.837,00:16:02.106,00:00:00.269,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:16:04.560,00:16:24.754,00:00:20.194,,,,,,,,,,,"so forty-five oh",,
00:16:24.754,00:16:34.682,00:00:09.928,,,,,,,,,,,,"what okay okay",
00:16:36.687,00:16:52.292,00:00:15.605,,,,,,,,,,,"you know it would be forty-nine because it's forty-nine time twelve",,
00:16:52.292,00:16:56.442,00:00:04.150,,,,,,,,,,,,"so it would be forty-nine times five over twelve",
00:16:57.001,00:16:57.789,00:00:00.788,,,,,,,,,,,,"and it's negative",
00:16:57.789,00:17:11.947,00:00:14.158,,,,,,,,,,,,"so forty-nine times five over twelve equals y",
00:17:13.234,00:17:18.602,00:00:05.368,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you're just going to this is here",
00:17:18.652,00:17:22.373,00:00:03.721,,,,,,,,,,,"this is forty-five",,
00:17:22.373,00:17:27.851,00:00:05.478,,,,,,,,,,,,"over so it's two forty-five all over twelve",
00:17:27.851,00:17:28.959,00:00:01.108,,,,,,,,,,,,"that doesn't go any equally",
00:17:28.959,00:17:30.595,00:00:01.636,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that's just there",
00:17:32.471,00:17:37.599,00:00:05.128,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that's the answer to that",
00:17:38.148,00:17:39.465,00:00:01.317,,,,,,,,,,,"do we stop answering",,
00:17:39.465,00:17:41.151,00:00:01.686,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I think if we do it will tell us",

00:17:46.768,00:17:55.209,00:00:08.441,,,,,,,,,,,,"so I'm going to rewrite this",
00:17:55.209,00:17:56.945,00:00:01.736,,,,,,,,,,,,"you have negative six",
00:17:57.075,00:17:59.888,00:00:02.813,,,,,,,,,,,,"just make eleven make a little more sense",
00:18:00.736,00:18:14.715,00:00:13.979,,,,,,,,,,,,"minus sixty-one equals twenty-five plus seven over seven y because seven over seven equals one",
00:18:14.844,00:18:19.743,00:00:04.899,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that makes it easier to do stuff between these two",
00:18:28.214,00:18:30.798,00:00:02.584,,,,,,,,,,,"this is thirty-six",,
00:18:31.756,00:18:39.548,00:00:07.792,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay so what you want to do is you want to get the twenty-five over here",
00:18:41.394,00:18:45.215,00:00:03.821,,,,,,,,,,,,"and this over here",
00:18:47.680,00:18:49.376,00:00:01.696,,,,,,,,,,,,"for either way but",
00:18:53.077,00:18:59.682,00:00:06.605,,,,,,,,,,,,"so how you would so that is subtract twenty-five from both sides",
00:18:59.682,00:19:08.013,00:00:08.331,,,,,,,,,,,,"you have negative six seven y minus",
00:19:08.273,00:19:16.185,00:00:07.912,,,,,,,,,,,,"what's that eighty-six equals y",
00:19:17.332,00:19:25.254,00:00:07.922,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you can add six sevenths y to both sides",
00:19:26.531,00:19:31.300,00:00:04.769,,,,,,,,,,,,"and so you have negative eighty-six equals",
00:19:32.089,00:19:37.087,00:00:04.998,,,,,,,,,,,,"and since this is seven over seven you get",
00:19:39.173,00:19:46.526,00:00:07.353,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler thirteen over seven y because that's just adding the six and the seven",
00:19:46.526,00:19:47.903,00:00:01.377,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you keep the seven on the bottom",
00:19:49.010,00:19:51.594,00:00:02.584,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you do the same thing we've been doing with all of them",
00:19:51.594,00:19:55.376,00:00:03.782,,,,,,,,,,,,"you just multiply negative eighty-six by seven divided by thirteen",
00:19:59.706,00:20:01.133,00:00:01.427,,,,,,,,,,,"divided by thirteen",,
00:20:01.282,00:20:01.532,00:00:00.250,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:20:04.226,00:20:05.732,00:00:01.506,,,,,,,,,,,"it's six",,
00:20:06.820,00:20:07.209,00:00:00.389,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"awesome",
00:20:18.563,00:20:19.100,00:00:00.537,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh there we go okay so",
00:20:22.863,00:20:24.978,00:00:02.115,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay this is yeah okay",
00:20:26.006,00:20:28.740,00:00:02.734,,,,,,,,,,,,"so let's see",
00:20:32.711,00:20:36.003,00:00:03.292,,,,,,,,,,,,"so this is eleven over one",
00:20:36.393,00:21:02.393,00:00:26.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"just to make that that's also thirty-three over three if you want to have it for this three over here",
00:21:12.451,00:21:27.716,00:00:15.265,,,,,,,,,,,"what in the world so three seventeen on both sides",,
00:21:30.819,00:21:49.157,00:00:18.338,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you have on this side negative one hundred minus eleven x equals ten over three x",
00:22:01.080,00:22:16.186,00:00:15.106,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you can't do that because one hundred doesn't have I'm sorry one hundred doesn't have an x connected to it",
00:22:16.724,00:22:21.723,00:00:04.999,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to get this over that side",
00:22:23.489,00:22:28.598,00:00:05.109,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you would add put that to both sides",
00:22:28.787,00:22:41.638,00:00:12.851,,,,,,,,,,,,"and remember this eleven is also thirty-three over three",
00:22:41.638,00:22:43.015,00:00:01.377,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you can add it to that",
00:22:48.233,00:22:48.253,00:00:00.020,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:22:48.253,00:22:49.779,00:00:01.526,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,"this it's very confusing",,

00:22:51.196,00:23:08.966,00:00:17.770,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah ten over three x plus",

00:23:25.788,00:23:39.127,00:00:13.339,,,,,,,,,,,,"x and then that's a plus",
00:23:39.696,00:23:41.681,00:00:01.985,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,"this time would face",,
00:23:42.110,00:23:48.436,00:00:06.326,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"oh yeah huh thirty-three over three x",
00:23:48.935,00:23:50.531,00:00:01.596,,,,,,,,,,,,"so can we do that",
00:23:51.220,00:23:54.851,00:00:03.631,,,,,,,,,,,"thirty-three times x thirty-three times",,
00:23:54.921,00:23:58.822,00:00:03.901,,,,,,,,,,,,"that's ten over three x plus thirty-three over three x",
00:24:01.466,00:24:05.278,00:00:03.812,,,,,,,,,,,"three goes into ten three times",,
00:24:05.747,00:24:06.984,00:00:01.237,,,,,,,,,,,,"no it's just plus",
00:24:08.610,00:24:12.142,00:00:03.532,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you just get forty-three over three x",
00:24:13.379,00:24:14.018,00:00:00.639,,,,,,,,,,,"that's the answer",,
00:24:14.816,00:24:27.787,00:00:12.971,,,,,,,,,,,,"and also you have negative one hundred equals forty-three over three x",
00:24:29.862,00:24:40.627,00:00:10.765,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you multiply it at this I mean you divide this by forty-three over three",
00:24:40.627,00:24:43.381,00:00:02.754,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you have negative one hundred",
00:24:43.511,00:24:46.454,00:00:02.943,,,,,,,,,,,,"and that's negative one hundred I promise",
