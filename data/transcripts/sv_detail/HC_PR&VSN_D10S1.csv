00:04:42.760,00:04:44.456,00:00:01.696,,,,,,,,,,"but I'm saying it's not like super different",,,,
00:04:44.456,00:04:49.734,00:00:05.278,,,,,,,,,,"because virtual classes do resemble Skype like at least now that we have the board up",,,,
00:04:49.894,00:04:56.638,00:00:06.744,,,,,,,,,,"because that's like the boarding class I think like the whiteboard or whatever whatever you call it",,,,
00:04:56.758,00:04:59.901,00:00:03.143,,,,,,,,,,,"I would just call it screen",,,

00:05:47.193,00:05:48.650,00:00:01.457,,,,,,,,,,"and it was too confusing",,,,
00:05:48.650,00:05:51.204,00:00:02.554,,,,,,,,,,"and it didn't work after I was trying",,,,
00:05:51.204,00:05:52.262,00:00:01.058,,,,,,,,,,"and so I gave up",,,,
00:05:52.791,00:05:54.537,00:00:01.746,,,,,,,,,,,"they might have given you the wrong pen",,,
00:05:54.537,00:05:56.881,00:00:02.344,,,,,,,,,,,"because I know you need to use the pen for it to on",,,

00:07:08.608,00:07:11.612,00:00:03.004,,,,,,,,,,"do I have to pause filler hold this down",,,,
00:07:11.751,00:07:13.048,00:00:01.297,,,,,,,,,"no actually don't hold that down",,,,,
00:07:13.198,00:07:13.986,00:00:00.788,,,,,,,,,"that does something",,,,,
00:07:13.986,00:07:17.359,00:00:03.373,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler there's ten of them to work through",,
00:07:17.588,00:07:20.741,00:00:03.153,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you'll be tutoring your text would be pause filler",,
00:07:20.741,00:07:22.527,00:00:01.786,,,,,,,,,,,,"there's ten of them to work through",,
00:07:22.527,00:07:23.395,00:00:00.868,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you'll be tutoring",,
00:07:23.395,00:07:25.999,00:00:02.604,,,,,,,,,,,,"your text would be pause filler (inaudible) and so",,
00:07:25.999,00:07:27.426,00:00:01.427,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah just kind of help them through",,
00:07:27.426,00:07:28.453,00:00:01.027,,,,,,,,,,,,"you want to encircle things",,
00:07:28.553,00:07:31.177,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,,,,"but try to avoid solving it for them again this that pause filler",,
00:07:31.177,00:07:32.374,00:00:01.197,,,,,,,,,,"I can't hear that well",,,,
00:07:32.374,00:07:34.589,00:00:02.215,,,,,,,,,,"I just don't hold this",,,,
00:07:34.589,00:07:36.754,00:00:02.165,,,,,,,,,"just don't press the button yeah so put down right",,,,,
00:07:36.754,00:07:38.830,00:00:02.076,,,,,,,,,"so you have about twenty minutes",,,,,
00:07:38.830,00:07:40.765,00:00:01.935,,,,,,,,,"and you'll be working any questions (inaudible)",,,,,
00:07:40.765,00:07:40.935,00:00:00.170,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler nope",,,,
00:07:41.444,00:07:43.848,00:00:02.404,,,,,,,,,"great you have twenty minutes",,,,,
00:07:44.497,00:07:48.448,00:00:03.951,,,,,,,,,,,"is it the questions in the future to do",,,
00:07:48.448,00:07:49.575,00:00:01.127,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler they're very similar",,
00:07:49.705,00:07:50.653,00:00:00.948,,,,,,,,,,,,"they're just different numbers",,
00:07:50.653,00:07:54.145,00:00:03.492,,,,,,,,,,,,"but like see how x minus blank equals blank",,
00:07:54.464,00:08:00.251,00:00:05.787,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then this is same thing so different numbers but very similar logic so again pause filler",,
00:08:00.251,00:08:05.778,00:00:05.527,,,,,,,,,,,,"and yeah you can see yourself there",,
00:08:05.778,00:08:07.694,00:00:01.916,,,,,,,,,,,,"so just try to make sure you stay within the",,

00:08:11.027,00:08:12.713,00:00:01.686,,,,,,,,,,,,"that we all need that pause filler so again",,
00:08:12.713,00:08:13.641,00:00:00.928,,,,,,,,,,,,"you're ready to begin",,
00:08:14.479,00:08:18.001,00:00:03.522,,,,,,,,,,,,"and again just try and solve as many as you can",,
00:08:18.001,00:08:24.087,00:00:06.086,,,,,,,,,,,,"don't be too worried about this is just an experiment",,
00:08:25.005,00:08:28.068,00:00:03.063,,,,,,,,,,,,"and I'll be back about twenty minutes and so again",,
00:08:28.068,00:08:31.939,00:00:03.871,,,,,,,,,,,,"these kind of helps one oh I'm sorry one other thing",,
00:08:32.318,00:08:35.511,00:00:03.193,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler when you're done with this go to the next problems",,
00:08:35.511,00:08:37.536,00:00:02.025,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you just put click these arrows down here",,
00:08:37.706,00:08:40.051,00:00:02.345,,,,,,,,,,,"that's twenty problems",,,
00:08:40.839,00:08:41.817,00:00:00.978,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler just worry about the first ten",,
00:08:41.817,00:08:44.161,00:00:02.344,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then the next ten are like something else",,
00:08:46.237,00:08:48.451,00:00:02.214,,,,,,,,,,,"nah okay what is oh I have this",,,
00:08:48.591,00:08:50.347,00:00:01.756,,,,,,,,,,,,"all righty pause filler good are you able to draw pause filler",,
00:08:50.347,00:08:51.914,00:00:01.567,,,,,,,,,,,"I think so",,,
00:08:52.103,00:08:52.462,00:00:00.359,,,,,,,,,,,,"push down",,
00:08:54.617,00:08:55.775,00:00:01.158,,,,,,,,,,"that was me",,,,
00:08:55.775,00:08:57.022,00:00:01.247,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay yeah so undo",,

00:09:20.628,00:09:23.941,00:00:03.313,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so do you see the x minus x equals thirteen",,,
00:09:24.410,00:09:26.405,00:00:01.995,,,,,,,,,,"yup I see it same place you are",,,,
00:09:26.405,00:09:31.743,00:00:05.338,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm guessing this is a question we're working on and I thought",,,
00:09:31.743,00:09:33.619,00:00:01.876,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"yup pause filler just don't push the button",,,,
00:09:33.719,00:09:34.796,00:00:01.077,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"that's all I was told",,,,

00:09:35.844,00:09:36.602,00:00:00.758,,,,,,,,,,"okay I'm ready",,,,
00:09:37.251,00:09:38.228,00:00:00.977,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"don't press anything",,,
00:09:38.228,00:09:39.056,00:00:00.828,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"just solve the problem (laughter)",,,
00:09:39.256,00:09:44.035,00:00:04.779,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"so I have no idea how to explain this (laughter)",,,
00:09:44.684,00:09:45.322,00:00:00.638,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"it's okay",,,,
00:09:45.322,00:09:47.627,00:00:02.305,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"I already kind of understand this",,,,
00:09:47.627,00:09:48.655,00:00:01.028,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"so just do your best",,,,
00:09:49.812,00:09:52.955,00:00:03.143,,,,,,,,,,,"what I know and do for this is just do the opposite (laughter)",,,
00:09:54.282,00:09:57.564,00:00:03.282,,,,,,,,,,,"so like if you do x minus six this is thirteen plus six",,,
00:09:57.564,00:09:58.093,00:00:00.529,,,,,,,,,,,"that's the answer",,,
00:09:58.672,00:10:02.533,00:00:03.861,,,,,,,,,,"okay like the opposite operation all right should I do this",,,,
00:10:02.663,00:10:04.120,00:00:01.457,,,,,,,,,,"or should you do this",,,,
00:10:04.120,00:10:04.818,00:00:00.698,,,,,,,,,,,"I think you (laughter)",,,
00:10:04.968,00:10:05.287,00:00:00.319,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,,
00:10:05.676,00:10:08.859,00:00:03.183,,,,,,,,,,,"it's just a thirteen plus six I mean",,,
00:10:09.048,00:10:12.620,00:00:03.572,,,,,,,,,,"this is hard to draw plus six okay",,,,
00:10:12.920,00:10:15.953,00:00:03.033,,,,,,,,,,,"no that is okay",,,
00:10:17.050,00:10:24.134,00:00:07.084,,,,,,,,,,"plus six so that would mean x equal to",,,,
00:10:24.134,00:10:27.846,00:00:03.712,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"that was a really bad equal to sign",,,,
00:10:27.846,00:10:29.472,00:00:01.626,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"I don't know what that is",,,,
00:10:30.100,00:10:36.336,00:00:06.236,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"I'm scared of it okay oh well nineteen",,,,
00:10:36.775,00:10:42.940,00:00:06.165,,,,,,,,,,"that's not a nine one minute okay wait",,,,
00:10:42.940,00:10:42.971,00:00:00.031,"TRC",,,,,,,,,"that's not a nine one minute okay wait",,,,
00:10:42.971,00:10:45.276,00:00:02.305,"TRC",,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"this is confusing",,,,
00:10:45.276,00:10:45.297,00:00:00.021,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:10:45.875,00:10:49.377,00:00:03.502,,,,,,,,,,"okay I think I got it now nineteen",,,,
00:10:49.377,00:10:51.163,00:00:01.786,,,,,,,,,,"there's my sloppy answer",,,,
00:10:51.771,00:10:55.213,00:00:03.442,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you can like double check it by nineteen minus six equals",,,
00:10:55.762,00:10:58.177,00:00:02.415,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that's a good trick okay",,,,
00:10:58.436,00:11:00.202,00:00:01.766,,,,,,,,,,"so I guess we'll move onto the next page now",,,,
00:11:00.202,00:11:01.260,00:00:01.058,,,,,,,,,,,"I suppose",,,
00:11:01.260,00:11:03.764,00:00:02.504,,,,,,,,,,,"so let's see if I can do that while messing out",,,
00:11:04.223,00:11:05.211,00:00:00.988,,,,,,,,,,"okay I'm on it",,,,
00:11:05.211,00:11:05.789,00:00:00.578,,,,,,,,,,"do you see it",,,,
00:11:05.839,00:11:07.416,00:00:01.577,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I'm trying to get down good",,,
00:11:07.456,00:11:08.902,00:00:01.446,,,,,,,,,,,"I am not good at this",,,
00:11:09.212,00:11:12.125,00:00:02.913,,,,,,,,,,"okay just like okay do you see it",,,,
00:11:12.125,00:11:21.534,00:00:09.409,,,,,,,,,,"fifteen equals negative eight plus p or a q whatever",,,,
00:11:24.517,00:11:25.235,00:00:00.718,,,,,,,,,,,"so (laughter)",,,
00:11:25.235,00:11:28.099,00:00:02.864,,,,,,,,,,"are you on the first page or the second page",,,,
00:11:28.099,00:11:30.832,00:00:02.733,,,,,,,,,,,"second I see fifteen equals minus eight equals p",,,
00:11:31.301,00:11:31.531,00:00:00.230,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,,
00:11:34.135,00:11:49.729,00:00:15.594,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"so I'm guessing I'll do achy nose achy nose ah (laughter) so just that like minus eight to each side I think",,,
00:11:49.729,00:11:49.849,00:00:00.120,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah",,,,
00:11:49.959,00:11:53.351,00:00:03.392,,,,,,,,,,,"that's what I'm doing here",,,
00:11:53.351,00:11:57.003,00:00:03.652,,,,,,,,,,"well at least minus negative eight yeah",,,,
00:11:57.202,00:12:00.535,00:00:03.333,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so add negative eight to both I suppose",,,
00:12:01.044,00:12:04.496,00:00:03.452,,,,,,,,,,"yeah which is just basically just adding the (inaudible) no right",,,,
00:12:04.496,00:12:06.052,00:00:01.556,,,,,,,,,,,"or no add eight to each",,,
00:12:06.292,00:12:09.205,00:00:02.913,,,,,,,,,,,"because eight minus eight equals eight equals zero so",,,
00:12:09.694,00:12:14.633,00:00:04.939,,,,,,,,,,"so plus yeah because it should not be those like a positive",,,,
00:12:14.633,00:12:15.281,00:00:00.648,,,,,,,,,,"I think",,,,
00:12:15.840,00:12:16.588,00:00:00.748,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know",,,,
00:12:16.588,00:12:19.711,00:00:03.123,,,,,,,,,,,"over or just a regular number plus a negative",,,
00:12:20.110,00:12:29.429,00:00:09.319,,,,,,,,,,"yeah well if you're subtracting wait one second yeah because we're subtracting negative eight",,,,
00:12:29.629,00:12:37.271,00:00:07.642,,,,,,,,,,"which would make it just adding eight pause filler plus eight plus eight",,,,
00:12:37.271,00:12:39.546,00:00:02.275,,,,,,,,,,,"what did you do to that",,,
00:12:40.404,00:12:45.243,00:00:04.839,,,,,,,,,,"so that would make this side just p",,,,
00:12:46.431,00:12:50.521,00:00:04.090,,,,,,,,,,"and oh jeez this is confusing okay",,,,
00:12:51.110,00:12:59.671,00:00:08.561,,,,,,,,,,"and that would make this side ninety-three right yeah",,,,
00:13:00.998,00:13:04.739,00:00:03.741,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah (laughter) the mental math there for a second",,,
00:13:04.739,00:13:07.203,00:00:02.464,,,,,,,,,,"I'm really about it for some reason",,,,
00:13:07.283,00:13:08.670,00:00:01.387,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"I need to show me a flash cards",,,,
00:13:09.019,00:13:10.666,00:00:01.647,,,,,,,,,,"okay I'm on page three now",,,,
00:13:11.035,00:13:14.148,00:00:03.113,,,,,,,,,,"I'll wait for you actually okay",,,,
00:13:16.931,00:13:19.456,00:00:02.525,,,,,,,,,,,"so seventeen I think",,,
00:13:20.373,00:13:21.700,00:00:01.327,,,,,,,,,,,"because you're trying to find the k",,,
00:13:21.940,00:13:24.973,00:00:03.033,,,,,,,,,,,"like what plus eleven would equal seventeen",,,
00:13:25.472,00:13:25.861,00:00:00.389,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,

00:14:28.179,00:14:30.205,00:00:02.026,,,,,,,,,,,"and that the same thing is",,,
00:14:30.205,00:14:36.520,00:00:06.315,,,,,,,,,,"yeah but I'm thinking if in algebra they would use this sign that circle",,,,

00:14:40.621,00:14:45.300,00:00:04.679,,,,,,,,,,,"so that's forty-four x equals forty-time whatever",,,
00:14:45.300,00:14:50.040,00:00:04.740,,,,,,,,,,,"it equal so two hundred and twenty divided by forty-four pretty much",,,

00:14:57.263,00:15:00.177,00:00:02.914,,,,,,,,,,,"because the opposite of multiplication is division I mean",,,

00:17:55.169,00:18:02.582,00:00:07.413,,,,,,,,,,,"so yeah like do you think what I have is like twelve equals twenty-four so",,,
00:18:02.582,00:18:04.907,00:00:02.325,,,,,,,,,,,"and I'm just going twelve over twelve",,,
00:18:04.907,00:18:07.371,00:00:02.464,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that's like basically what ours is",,,,
00:18:09.087,00:18:12.240,00:00:03.153,,,,,,,,,,"so do we do it right so far at least the dividing by forty-four",,,,
00:18:12.559,00:18:12.809,00:00:00.250,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:18:12.939,00:18:13.038,00:00:00.099,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,,
00:18:13.038,00:18:17.179,00:00:04.141,,,,,,,,,,,"that's just pretty much how many time forty-four",,,
00:18:17.179,00:18:18.027,00:00:00.848,,,,,,,,,,,"I can go with that",,,
00:18:18.576,00:18:26.149,00:00:07.573,,,,,,,,,,"okay okay so forty-four plus forty-four it's eighty-eight and then eighty-eight",,,,
00:18:26.528,00:18:27.994,00:00:01.466,,,,,,,,,,"that's forty-four",,,,
00:18:28.553,00:18:30.389,00:00:01.836,,,,,,,,,,"is there a faster way to do this",,,,
00:18:30.718,00:18:33.861,00:00:03.143,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I wish calculator up (laughter)",,,
00:18:33.861,00:18:34.450,00:00:00.589,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"yeah",,,,
00:18:34.450,00:18:43.978,00:00:09.528,,,,,,,,,,,"one seventy-six equals forty-four",,,
00:18:45.395,00:18:46.941,00:00:01.546,,,,,,,,,,"here okay",,,,
00:18:48.129,00:18:50.503,00:00:02.374,,,,,,,,,,,"another four so far so",,,
00:18:51.461,00:18:53.995,00:00:02.534,,,,,,,,,,"okay yeah you're closer than I am",,,,
00:18:53.995,00:18:55.711,00:00:01.716,,,,,,,,,,"so I guess I'll wait",,,,
00:19:06.437,00:19:07.914,00:00:01.477,,,,,,,,,,,"I got it",,,
00:19:08.083,00:19:09.211,00:00:01.128,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay how much is it",,,,
00:19:09.600,00:19:12.383,00:00:02.783,,,,,,,,,,,"so for me I just want the (inaudible) though (laughter)",,,
00:19:12.383,00:19:13.241,00:00:00.858,,,,,,,,,,"okay what do you",,,,
00:19:13.241,00:19:30.622,00:00:17.381,,,,,,,,,,,"so I think it's either five or six I'm fine with",,,
00:19:30.622,00:19:36.968,00:00:06.346,,,,,,,,,,"why would it seems more reasonable",,,,
00:19:40.051,00:19:40.569,00:00:00.518,,,,,,,,,,,"five",,,
00:19:40.998,00:19:44.750,00:00:03.752,,,,,,,,,,"okay so five go right here",,,,
00:19:44.750,00:19:48.521,00:00:03.771,,,,,,,,,,"and how many five times was it exactly",,,,
00:19:49.619,00:19:52.732,00:00:03.113,,,,,,,,,,"do you remember what five times forty-four was",,,,
00:19:53.620,00:19:54.498,00:00:00.878,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm double-checking that now",,,
00:19:54.498,00:19:54.588,00:00:00.090,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,,
00:19:54.647,00:20:09.095,00:00:14.448,,,,,,,,,,,"four five let me see (laughter) sounds like make",,,
00:20:09.095,00:20:20.768,00:00:11.673,,,,,,,,,,,"and now it will work pause filler (laughter)",,,
00:20:20.768,00:20:25.158,00:00:04.390,,,,,,,,,,"you do write it down as we're doing the problem is what I'm asking",,,,
00:20:25.158,00:20:27.892,00:00:02.734,,,,,,,,,,"and did it fit into it exactly",,,,
00:20:27.892,00:20:30.855,00:00:02.963,,,,,,,,,,"because if it did then it's two hundred and twenty",,,,
00:20:31.164,00:20:33.659,00:00:02.495,,,,,,,,,,,"because I just went like forty-four (inaudible) pause filler",,,
00:20:38.578,00:20:38.588,00:00:00.010,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:20:38.588,00:20:41.022,00:00:02.434,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"yeah I need to talk",,,

00:20:45.791,00:20:47.218,00:00:01.427,,,,,,,,,,"there we go it's back",,,,
00:20:47.617,00:20:50.670,00:00:03.053,,,,,,,,,,,"so I just went like forty-four plus forty-four equals eighty-eight",,,
00:20:50.750,00:20:53.124,00:00:02.374,,,,,,,,,,,"so I want eighty-eight plus eighty-eight which would be four",,,
00:20:53.124,00:20:54.731,00:00:01.607,,,,,,,,,,,"then I added another forty-four so",,,
00:20:54.731,00:21:03.541,00:00:08.810,,,,,,,,,,"so the fifth one the fifth forty-four that you added what you end up with was that exactly two hundred and twenty",,,,
00:21:04.349,00:21:05.746,00:00:01.397,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I'm still checking it now one sec",,,
00:21:05.746,00:21:11.223,00:00:05.477,,,,,,,,,,"okay because if it was then we can just write two hundred twenty",,,,
00:21:11.223,00:21:12.999,00:00:01.776,,,,,,,,,,"and then you're left with no remainder",,,,
00:21:12.999,00:21:16.272,00:00:03.273,,,,,,,,,,"and so your answer is that's",,,,

00:21:21.081,00:21:26.888,00:00:05.807,,,,,,,,,,"so then the answer would be five if it fits exactly is what I'm saying",,,,
00:21:26.888,00:21:28.384,00:00:01.496,,,,,,,,,,,"I think it's five so",,,
00:21:28.384,00:21:31.218,00:00:02.834,,,,,,,,,,"yeah because you'd subtract this",,,,

00:21:40.956,00:21:45.605,00:00:04.649,,,,,,,,,,,"x equals five maybe (laughter) we hope",,,
00:21:45.605,00:21:48.469,00:00:02.864,,,,,,,,,,"we think let's just move on",,,,
00:21:49.000,00:21:53.000,00:00:04.000,,,,,,,,,,"(inaudible) (laughter)",,,,
00:21:53.148,00:22:01.310,00:00:08.162,,,,,,,,,,"okay I think I get how to do this",,,,
00:22:01.310,00:22:04.163,00:00:02.853,,,,,,,,,,"just tell me like what comes to nine",,,,
00:22:04.163,00:22:09.810,00:00:05.647,,,,,,,,,,"or how you would explain how to do it",,,,
00:22:10.429,00:22:17.373,00:00:06.944,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm trying to find the specific thing over here (inaudible) (laughter)",,,

00:22:19.349,00:22:31.990,00:00:12.641,,,,,,,,,,,"oh my god (laughter) okay so (inaudible) so we can start this problem",,,
00:22:32.120,00:22:35.053,00:00:02.933,,,,,,,,,,,"but pause filler (laughter) I have no clue what I'm doing",,,

00:22:39.583,00:22:40.630,00:00:01.047,,,,,,,,,,"or like if I know it",,,,
00:22:40.740,00:22:42.486,00:00:01.746,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know if I'm supposed to help you",,,,
00:22:42.486,00:22:45.419,00:00:02.933,,,,,,,,,,"or wait until I'm tutoring you",,,,

00:22:46.507,00:22:47.664,00:00:01.157,,,,,,,,,,,"right now I'm tutoring you",,,
00:22:47.664,00:22:49.370,00:00:01.706,,,,,,,,,,,"so I guess I know what I'm doing",,,
00:22:49.460,00:22:53.890,00:00:04.430,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so I guess I'll just listen hands off",,,,
00:22:55.496,00:22:58.799,00:00:03.303,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm trying to solve it my mind first to see if I get it that's all",,,
00:22:58.959,00:23:02.411,00:00:03.452,,,,,,,,,,"yeah well you can write it down as you go if you want",,,,
00:23:02.411,00:23:04.985,00:00:02.574,,,,,,,,,,,"like I don't think there's anything wrong with that",,,

00:23:16.608,00:23:20.220,00:00:03.612,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"and I'm like wait everyone there's a mic on me",,,,
00:23:20.460,00:23:21.457,00:00:00.997,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"I probably shouldn't",,,,
00:23:27.484,00:23:32.373,00:00:04.889,,,,,,,,,,,"(laughter) (inaudible) so I guess you'd have to cross cancel the negative number",,,
00:23:32.452,00:23:32.851,00:00:00.399,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:23:33.839,00:23:41.951,00:00:08.112,,,,,,,,,,,"so like minus nine plus nine and then forty-one plus nine",,,
00:23:42.899,00:23:43.577,00:00:00.678,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,,
00:23:43.637,00:23:43.936,00:00:00.299,,,,,,,,,,,"maybe (laughter)",,,
00:23:43.936,00:23:44.914,00:00:00.978,,,,,,,,,,"so you want to write that",,,,
00:23:44.914,00:23:47.169,00:00:02.255,,,,,,,,,,"or do you want me to",,,,
00:23:47.169,00:23:48.466,00:00:01.297,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler you because you're a lot better at this (laughter)",,,
00:23:48.586,00:23:49.953,00:00:01.367,,,,,,,"LPB",,,,"you're a lot better at writing",,,
00:23:49.953,00:23:53.275,00:00:03.322,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you say what do you want me to write again",,,,
00:23:53.275,00:23:56.218,00:00:02.943,,,,,,,,,,,"it's like cross cancel this one",,,
00:23:56.268,00:23:58.683,00:00:02.415,,,,,,,,,,"so cancel out the negative nine is what you're saying",,,,
00:23:58.683,00:23:59.690,00:00:01.007,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah pretty much",,,
00:23:59.690,00:24:05.687,00:00:05.997,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you would do add negative nine",,,,
00:24:05.687,00:24:12.302,00:00:06.615,,,,,,,,,,"and you have to do that to each side right",,,,
00:24:12.302,00:24:13.529,00:00:01.227,,,,,,,,,,,"I think",,,
00:24:14.946,00:24:17.310,00:00:02.364,,,,,,,,,,"I'm sorry I don't want to like",,,,
00:24:17.410,00:24:22.888,00:00:05.478,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm looking at them",,,
00:24:22.888,00:24:24.524,00:00:01.636,,,,,,,,,,"okay now what does it say to do",,,,
00:24:24.524,00:24:27.946,00:00:03.422,,,,,,,,,,"or what do you want me to do",,,,
00:24:27.946,00:24:31.997,00:00:04.051,,,,,,,,,,,"I guess when you kind of divide",,,
00:24:31.997,00:24:36.198,00:00:04.201,,,,,,,,,,,"because you're doing thirteen p which is thirteen times p",,,
00:24:36.307,00:24:38.023,00:00:01.716,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so",,,,
00:24:38.093,00:24:42.503,00:00:04.410,,,,,,,,,,,"it's like divided by five",,,
00:24:42.503,00:24:46.714,00:00:04.211,,,,,,,,,,,"or for us it would be thirteen so forty-one divided by thirteen and thirteen divided thirteen",,,
00:24:46.714,00:24:48.280,00:00:01.566,,,,,,,,,,"I'm trying to write on this",,,,
00:24:50.724,00:24:53.398,00:00:02.674,,,,,,,,,,"so that's yeah okay",,,,
00:24:54.646,00:24:56.721,00:00:02.075,,,,,,,,,,"so we should probably do this",,,,
00:24:57.070,00:24:59.225,00:00:02.155,,,,,,,,,,"because I wrote it down",,,,
00:24:59.225,00:25:00.223,00:00:00.998,,,,,,,,,,"but we didn't actually do it",,,,
00:25:00.772,00:25:06.030,00:00:05.258,,,,,,,,,,"so we're left with thirteen oh my gosh",,,,
00:25:06.030,00:25:14.530,00:00:08.500,,,,,,,,,,"so after we do the first step you told me to do",,,,
00:25:14.750,00:25:24.069,00:00:09.319,,,,,,,,,,"I get thirteen p equals forty-one",,,,
00:25:24.099,00:25:26.314,00:00:02.215,,,,,,,,,,"after that we were",,,,
00:25:26.763,00:25:29.347,00:00:02.584,,,,,,,,,,,"well you have to add nine to forty-one",,,
00:25:29.456,00:25:32.051,00:00:02.595,,,,,,,,,,,"so that would technically be fifty now",,,
00:25:32.051,00:25:32.859,00:00:00.808,,,,,,,,,,"oh right you're right",,,,
00:25:32.859,00:25:36.730,00:00:03.871,,,,,,,,,,"I forgot to do that",,,,
00:25:39.573,00:25:41.349,00:00:01.776,,,,,,,,,,"see this is what tutors are for",,,,
00:25:41.349,00:25:44.043,00:00:02.694,,,,,,,,,,"it remind you skip something yeah",,,,
00:25:44.043,00:25:50.838,00:00:06.795,,,,,,,,,,"so I'm adding negative nine which is basically just subtracting nine right",,,,
00:25:51.796,00:25:53.592,00:00:01.796,,,,,,,,,,,"well you're adding nine",,,
00:25:53.592,00:25:56.864,00:00:03.272,,,,,,,,,,,"because minus nine wouldn't if you subtracted it it would be",,,
00:25:58.351,00:25:59.538,00:00:01.187,,,,,,,,,,"so you want me to add nine",,,,
00:25:59.568,00:26:03.220,00:00:03.652,,,,,,,,,,,"minus fifteen so minus nine plus nine and then forty-one plus nine",,,
00:26:03.709,00:26:04.337,00:00:00.628,,,,,,,,,,"so fifty",,,,
00:26:05.016,00:26:05.315,00:00:00.299,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:26:05.415,00:26:07.001,00:00:01.586,,,,,,,,,,"is that what you're saying okay so",,,,
00:26:07.001,00:26:08.717,00:00:01.716,,,,,,,,,,,"the hand minus",,,
00:26:08.717,00:26:11.012,00:00:02.295,,,,,,,,,,"okay (inaudible) that to make it fifty",,,,
00:26:12.588,00:26:16.689,00:00:04.101,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler that's a really bad fifty but what we're doing and then",,,,
00:26:16.769,00:26:21.388,00:00:04.619,,,,,,,,,,,"so then thirteen p you have to divide thirteen by forty-one",,,
00:26:21.927,00:26:23.534,00:00:01.607,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"yeah this is getting really crooked",,,,
00:26:23.643,00:26:26.367,00:00:02.724,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,"you have to tilt your head to see it",,,,
00:26:26.367,00:26:27.000,00:00:00.633,,,,,,,,,,"but that's okay",,,,
00:26:27.000,00:26:28.000,00:00:01.000,,,,,,,,,,"(inaudible)",,,,
00:26:32.214,00:26:38.290,00:00:06.076,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so then that gives us p equals",,,,
00:26:38.480,00:26:54.713,00:00:16.233,,,,,,,,,,"how many time does thirteen go into fifty and fifteen twenty-six right fifteen twenty-six thirty-nine twenty-two forty-five",,,,
00:26:54.713,00:26:56.249,00:00:01.536,,,,,,,,,,,"you can go to forty-two",,,
00:26:57.197,00:27:02.006,00:00:04.809,,,,,,,,,,,"but then if you add forty-two plus thirteen it will be forty-five so",,,
00:27:02.355,00:27:04.660,00:00:02.305,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so that's four right",,,,
00:27:04.660,00:27:04.740,00:00:00.080,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:27:04.890,00:27:06.007,00:00:01.117,,,,,,,,,,"okay so",,,,
00:27:07.134,00:27:08.052,00:00:00.918,,,,,,,,,,,"so you have a remainder",,,
00:27:09.469,00:27:11.305,00:00:01.836,,,,,,,,,,"yeah but I'm pretty sure",,,,
00:27:11.305,00:27:13.979,00:00:02.674,,,,,,,,,,"like with the problems that I did on the paper it is simplified",,,,
00:27:15.226,00:27:18.429,00:00:03.203,,,,,,,,,,"so I don't know what they want me to do",,,,
00:27:18.429,00:27:21.382,00:00:02.953,,,,,,,,,,"oh I can see myself now",,,,
00:27:21.382,00:27:22.899,00:00:01.517,,,,,,,,,,"okay now I can't",,,,
00:27:23.048,00:27:24.186,00:00:01.138,,,,,,,,,,"it went back",,,,
00:27:24.186,00:27:25.752,00:00:01.566,,,,,,,,,,"now I can see the tip of my head",,,,
00:27:25.752,00:27:26.351,00:00:00.599,,,,,,,,,,"so I could not (inaudible)",,,,
00:27:26.351,00:27:29.753,00:00:03.402,,,,,,,,,,"I think we just leave it at that right",,,,
00:27:30.821,00:27:34.941,00:00:04.120,,,,,,,,,,"or should we add the remainder or write down the remainder",,,,
00:27:36.867,00:27:40.738,00:00:03.871,,,,,,,,,,,"well the remainder would be pause filler eight so",,,
00:27:41.357,00:27:43.432,00:00:02.075,,,,,,,,,,"can I just like write r",,,,
00:27:44.330,00:27:45.078,00:00:00.748,,,,,,,,,,"this is what I",,,,
00:27:45.078,00:27:46.555,00:00:01.477,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that's before eight",,,
00:27:46.854,00:27:48.989,00:00:02.135,,,,,,,,,,"this is what I was taught to do",,,,
00:27:48.989,00:27:51.693,00:00:02.704,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know if (inaudible) this right page six",,,,
00:27:52.821,00:27:53.699,00:00:00.878,,,,,,,,,,"this is similar",,,,
00:27:53.699,00:27:55.614,00:00:01.915,,,,,,,,,,,"an easy one",,,
00:27:55.704,00:27:55.794,00:00:00.090,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,

00:39:16.886,00:39:17.824,00:00:00.938,,,,,,,,,,,"I think so",,,
00:39:18.812,00:39:20.218,00:00:01.406,,,,,,,,,,"yeah constants and variables",,,,
00:39:23.571,00:39:31.124,00:00:07.553,,,,,,,,,,,"so we'd have to get rid of eighteen",,,
00:39:31.622,00:39:32.680,00:00:01.058,,,,,,,,,,,"eighteen's got to go",,,
00:39:33.059,00:39:37.898,00:00:04.839,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so the opposite operation so eighteen is being added which means you were",,,,
00:39:37.898,00:39:40.363,00:00:02.465,,,,,,,,,,,"so eighteen minus eighteen equals zero",,,
00:39:40.772,00:39:45.441,00:00:04.669,,,,,,,,,,,"twenty-five minus eighteen equals five",,,
00:39:46.030,00:39:47.476,00:00:01.446,,,,,,,,,,"okay so",,,,
00:39:50.140,00:39:51.767,00:00:01.627,,,,,,,,,,,"so yeah it would be five",,,
00:39:51.767,00:39:54.131,00:00:02.364,,,,,,,,,,,"plus twenty-three minus eighteen equals five",,,
00:39:54.774,00:39:54.790,00:00:00.016,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,,

00:40:05.525,00:40:13.228,00:00:07.703,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so eighteen minus eight eighteen or (laughter) I can't talk",,,
00:40:13.976,00:40:15.203,00:00:01.227,,,,,,,,,,"so you said five",,,,
00:40:15.203,00:40:17.608,00:00:02.405,,,,,,,,,,"I guess I don't know what a negative y would be",,,,
00:40:17.608,00:40:19.224,00:00:01.616,,,,,,,,,,"I guess it just be negative y",,,,
00:40:19.274,00:40:22.387,00:00:03.113,,,,,,,,,,"like I don't know if you have to do anything like that",,,,
00:40:22.387,00:40:28.104,00:00:05.717,,,,,,,,,,"I guess it's done",,,,
00:40:30.110,00:40:30.289,00:00:00.179,,,,,,,,,,,"so (inaudible)",,,
00:40:30.389,00:40:32.334,00:00:01.945,,,,,,,,,,"are you on page three",,,,
00:40:32.674,00:40:33.402,00:00:00.728,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,,
00:40:33.402,00:40:37.014,00:00:03.612,,,,,,,,,,"I'm confused okay let me see",,,,
00:40:38.121,00:40:41.943,00:00:03.822,,,,,,,,,,"wait a minute okay it's not as bad as I think",,,,
00:40:41.943,00:40:47.859,00:00:05.916,,,,,,,,,,"there's just a lot of negatives so oh okay",,,,
00:40:47.889,00:40:53.895,00:00:06.006,,,,,,,,,,"so the other side you want me the variable on one side",,,,
00:40:53.895,00:40:54.394,00:00:00.499,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:40:54.704,00:41:00.161,00:00:05.457,,,,,,,,,,"so to do that you have to what kind of sheet is that is that",,,,
00:41:00.161,00:41:02.187,00:00:02.026,,,,,,,,,,"you have to add",,,,
00:41:02.187,00:41:04.900,00:00:02.713,,,,,,,,,,"so see at once negative or one is a positive",,,,
00:41:06.018,00:41:11.595,00:00:05.577,,,,,,,,,,"so let's say if you add one to each side you cannot see that",,,,
00:41:11.645,00:41:14.339,00:00:02.694,,,,,,,,,,"but oh well you add one to each side",,,,
00:41:16.235,00:41:19.507,00:00:03.272,,,,,,,,,,"then that's cancelling out this one",,,,
00:41:20.106,00:41:25.234,00:00:05.128,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler right here that's right yeah",,,,
00:41:25.444,00:41:26.781,00:00:01.337,,,,,,,,,,"oh it's cancelling out this one",,,,
00:41:26.781,00:41:28.776,00:00:01.995,,,,,,,,,,"so this is like comes zero",,,,
00:41:28.776,00:41:29.674,00:00:00.898,,,,,,,,,,"it's nothing",,,,
00:41:30.323,00:41:33.785,00:00:03.462,,,,,,,,,,"it's just fourteen now",,,,
00:41:35.142,00:41:39.242,00:00:04.100,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler and then this one becomes two okay",,,,
00:41:39.242,00:41:42.285,00:00:03.043,,,,,,,,,,"and then you do it from there",,,,
00:41:42.285,00:41:44.590,00:00:02.305,,,,,,,,,,"so I'm going to write out the problem for you now",,,,
00:41:44.720,00:41:45.788,00:00:01.068,,,,,,,,,,"because it's all messy",,,,
00:41:46.795,00:41:55.625,00:00:08.830,,,,,,,,,,"so fourteen equals thirty-six plus two",,,,
00:41:55.625,00:41:57.002,00:00:01.377,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you solve that",,,,
00:41:57.172,00:42:05.034,00:00:07.862,,,,,,,,,,,"should two be multiplied by k",,,
00:42:05.034,00:42:07.648,00:00:02.614,,,,,,,,,,"right now it's being multiplied by k yes so",,,,
00:42:07.648,00:42:12.108,00:00:04.460,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know how anything multiplied by how",,,
00:42:12.108,00:42:16.378,00:00:04.270,,,,,,,,,,,"it would have to be a negative number",,,
00:42:16.378,00:42:20.638,00:00:04.260,,,,,,,,,,,"because you'd have to kind of get fourteen out of thirty-six",,,
00:42:21.776,00:42:24.539,00:00:02.763,,,,,,,,,,"yeah do you want me to split down the middle for you",,,,
00:42:24.539,00:42:26.066,00:00:01.527,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know if that helps you",,,,
00:42:26.066,00:42:27.373,00:00:01.307,,,,,,,,,,"but it helps me",,,,
00:42:28.750,00:42:29.997,00:00:01.247,,,,,,,,,,"sorry if it doesn't help you",,,,
00:42:29.997,00:42:37.460,00:00:07.463,,,,,,,,,,"it's like I always just choose a random start",,,,
00:42:37.460,00:42:42.219,00:00:04.759,,,,,,,,,,"so you can either start out thirty-six or start at two k",,,,
00:42:42.269,00:42:47.058,00:00:04.789,,,,,,,,,,"but either way you're trying to cancel out all of the constants",,,,
00:42:47.058,00:42:50.201,00:00:03.143,,,,,,,,,,"so we start at two k two",,,,
00:42:50.201,00:42:52.765,00:00:02.564,,,,,,,,,,"it's being multiplied by k",,,,
00:42:53.154,00:42:58.003,00:00:04.849,,,,,,,,,,"and so you would do the opposite pause filler operation",,,,
00:42:58.582,00:43:00.707,00:00:02.125,,,,,,,,,,,"so fourteen divided by two",,,
00:43:00.707,00:43:00.847,00:00:00.140,,,,,,,,,,"huh",,,,
00:43:01.186,00:43:02.204,00:00:01.018,,,,,,,,,,,"so fourteen divided by two",,,
00:43:02.493,00:43:08.450,00:00:05.957,,,,,,,,,,"yes fourteen divided by two",,,,

00:44:48.323,00:44:54.359,00:00:06.036,,,,,,,,,,,"what would be two divided by two",,,
00:44:54.638,00:44:54.748,00:00:00.110,,,,,,,,,,"huh",,,,
00:44:54.748,00:44:57.751,00:00:03.003,,,,,,,,,,,"two divided by two would equal to zero so fourteen divided two",,,
00:44:57.751,00:45:01.154,00:00:03.403,,,,,,,,,,"yeah two divided two so which means we're just left with",,,,
00:45:01.154,00:45:03.798,00:00:02.644,,,,,,,,,,"yeah we're just left with seven equals",,,,
00:45:04.246,00:45:05.055,00:00:00.809,,,,,,,,,,,"thirty-six",,,
00:45:05.055,00:45:08.666,00:00:03.611,,,,,,,,,,"thirty-six but we still have plus k",,,,
00:45:08.666,00:45:10.243,00:00:01.577,,,,,,,,,,"because we just cancelled out the two",,,,
00:45:10.243,00:45:11.490,00:00:01.247,,,,,,,,,,"we didn't cancel out the k",,,,
00:45:13.156,00:45:18.315,00:00:05.159,,,,,,,,,,,"so we have to get one of this thirty-six or seven",,,
00:45:19.013,00:45:21.777,00:00:02.764,,,,,,,,,,"no thirty-six because seven yeah",,,,
00:45:22.305,00:45:28.042,00:00:05.737,,,,,,,,,,,"so thirty-six minus thirty-six equals zero so seven minus thirty-six",,,
00:45:28.611,00:45:30.247,00:00:01.636,,,,,,,,,,"yup exactly",,,,
00:45:32.432,00:45:35.000,00:00:02.568,,,,,,,,,,,"well equal minus twenty-nine",,,
00:45:35.000,00:45:35.096,00:00:00.096,,,,,,,,,,,"hmm",,,
00:45:35.775,00:45:36.643,00:00:00.868,,,,,,,,,,,"negative twenty-nine",,,
00:45:36.902,00:45:38.299,00:00:01.397,,,,,,,,,,"yup so negative",,,,
00:45:38.559,00:45:40.225,00:00:01.666,,,,,,,,,,,"negative twenty-nine equals k",,,
00:45:40.993,00:45:42.061,00:00:01.068,,,,,,,,,,"yup we did it",,,,
00:45:42.140,00:45:43.447,00:00:01.307,,,,,,,,,,"I don't think we really have to write it out",,,,

00:45:46.111,00:45:54.173,00:00:08.062,,,,,,,,,,"negative twenty-nine equals pause filler k oh well",,,,
00:45:54.173,00:45:58.234,00:00:04.061,,,,,,,,,,"okay are you on page four",,,,
00:45:58.294,00:45:58.413,00:00:00.119,,,,,,,,,,,"yup",,,
00:45:58.633,00:46:15.435,00:00:16.802,,,,,,,,,,"okay so this is like very similar so last time when we want the variables on one side last time when they were on two sides",,,,
00:46:15.435,00:46:16.353,00:00:00.918,,,,,,,,,,"do you remember what we did",,,,
00:46:17.380,00:46:17.560,00:00:00.180,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:46:18.338,00:46:22.379,00:00:04.041,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so do you want me to write it",,,,
00:46:22.379,00:46:25.282,00:00:02.903,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you're better at writing it I'm not good",,,
00:46:25.282,00:46:29.044,00:00:03.762,,,,,,,,,,"okay so what shall we do first",,,,
00:46:30.081,00:46:31.349,00:00:01.268,,,,,,,,,,,"we get rid of the p",,,
00:46:32.436,00:46:40.518,00:00:08.082,,,,,,,,,,"yeah by canceling it out adding b but what we do to one side we have to do it to the next",,,,
00:46:40.797,00:46:42.862,00:00:02.065,,,,,,,,,,,"so b plus b equals b (laughter)",,,
00:46:43.840,00:46:48.769,00:00:04.929,,,,,,,,,,"so let's just pause filler write it out again over here",,,,
00:46:49.437,00:47:03.775,00:00:14.338,,,,,,,,,,"so seven seventeen sorry equals eighteen plus two b",,,,
00:47:04.044,00:47:09.133,00:00:05.089,,,,,,,,,,,"would b we're getting rid off because this one the seventeen minus b",,,
00:47:09.173,00:47:11.747,00:00:02.574,,,,,,,,,,,"that one could stay but the thirteen plus b",,,
00:47:11.747,00:47:14.431,00:00:02.684,,,,,,,,,,,"I think we should get rid of that one",,,
00:47:14.451,00:47:15.568,00:00:01.117,,,,,,,,,,"well you could it either way",,,,
00:47:15.568,00:47:17.035,00:00:01.467,,,,,,,,,,"I think you could pause filler",,,,
00:47:17.673,00:47:20.198,00:00:02.525,,,,,,,,,,"actually I don't think you could do it either way",,,,
00:47:20.517,00:47:25.875,00:00:05.358,,,,,,,,,,"because we need to trans like I guess",,,,
00:47:26.104,00:47:28.120,00:00:02.016,,,,,,,,,,,"I got it I got it on my mind",,,
00:47:28.120,00:47:31.821,00:00:03.701,,,,,,,,,,"it's really hard to explain if you want it",,,,
00:47:31.901,00:47:34.146,00:00:02.245,,,,,,,,,,"I don't think you could keep the minus b",,,,
00:47:34.146,00:47:43.914,00:00:09.768,,,,,,,,,,"because if you want it to minus that one if you want to do to minus b minus b you just be locked with like negative b",,,,
00:47:43.914,00:47:48.693,00:00:04.779,,,,,,,,,,"I don't really know I don't think it works so",,,,
00:47:48.693,00:47:53.622,00:00:04.929,,,,,,,,,,,"I guess I have to go two time two or we never mind",,,
00:47:53.781,00:47:57.084,00:00:03.303,,,,,,,,,,,"we have to get rid of thirteen so",,,
00:47:57.453,00:47:59.309,00:00:01.856,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you can do whatever first",,,,
00:47:59.309,00:48:01.593,00:00:02.284,,,,,,,,,,,"thirteen minus thirteen equals zero",,,
00:48:02.112,00:48:05.195,00:00:03.083,,,,,,,,,,,"seventeen minus thirteen equals four so",,,
00:48:05.345,00:48:06.622,00:00:01.277,,,,,,,,,,"so let's get I don't know why",,,,
00:48:06.662,00:48:11.431,00:00:04.769,,,,,,,,,,"I like to scribble this out but just so",,,,
00:48:11.431,00:48:12.628,00:00:01.197,,,,,,,,,,"what did you say four",,,,
00:48:14.494,00:48:19.243,00:00:04.749,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah four because three plus four equals thirteen",,,
00:48:19.792,00:48:23.544,00:00:03.752,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know",,,
00:48:23.544,00:48:26.477,00:00:02.933,,,,,,,,,,"minus thirteen equals four",,,,
00:48:26.477,00:48:37.472,00:00:10.995,,,,,,,,,,"I'm just going to rewrite this because yeah okay",,,,
00:48:37.472,00:48:39.457,00:00:01.985,,,,,,,,,,"so here's what we have left",,,,
00:48:39.457,00:48:45.434,00:00:05.977,,,,,,,,,,,"well so we must be going four divide it",,,
00:48:45.434,00:48:48.856,00:00:03.422,,,,,,,,,,,"because two times b equals four",,,
00:48:48.856,00:48:50.522,00:00:01.666,,,,,,,,,,,"so we go four divided by two",,,
00:48:50.522,00:48:52.159,00:00:01.637,,,,,,,,,,,"it would be two",,,
00:48:52.847,00:48:54.134,00:00:01.287,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so",,,,
00:48:54.473,00:48:55.631,00:00:01.158,,,,,,,,,,,"so two equals b",,,
00:48:55.631,00:48:59.342,00:00:03.711,,,,,,,,,,"yup b equals two",,,,
00:48:59.342,00:49:00.529,00:00:01.187,,,,,,,,,,"that's not a two",,,,
00:49:00.529,00:49:01.667,00:00:01.138,,,,,,,,,,,"that's an eight",,,
00:49:02.635,00:49:04.441,00:00:01.806,,,,,,,,,,"that's now it's kind of a two",,,,
00:49:04.441,00:49:05.398,00:00:00.957,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know",,,,
00:49:05.398,00:49:08.322,00:00:02.924,,,,,,,,,,"I draw away in twos you know what whatever",,,,
00:49:08.322,00:49:11.624,00:00:03.302,,,,,,,,,,"you can see it like above it that",,,,
00:49:11.624,00:49:12.412,00:00:00.788,,,,,,,,,,"it's four",,,,
00:49:12.412,00:49:13.021,00:00:00.609,,,,,,,,,,,"it's on recording (laughter)",,,
00:49:13.221,00:49:16.344,00:00:03.123,,,,,,,,,,"yeah we're saying it",,,,
00:49:16.423,00:49:19.067,00:00:02.644,,,,,,,,,,,"minus nine it (inaudible) so",,,
00:49:19.985,00:49:22.080,00:00:02.095,,,,,,,,,,"this thing is easier I think",,,,
00:49:22.080,00:49:22.200,00:00:00.120,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:49:23.238,00:49:24.166,00:00:00.928,,,,,,,,,,"yeah this is easier",,,,
00:49:24.196,00:49:26.061,00:00:01.865,,,,,,,,,,,"so one divided by nine",,,
00:49:26.161,00:49:29.973,00:00:03.812,,,,,,,,,,"I think it's only one step mm-hmm",,,,
00:49:29.973,00:49:34.532,00:00:04.559,,,,,,,,,,"so divided by but you would divide it by negative nine right",,,,
00:49:34.532,00:49:34.961,00:00:00.429,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah but",,,
00:49:35.191,00:49:37.835,00:00:02.644,,,,,,,,,,"yeah negative nine pause filler",,,,
00:49:37.974,00:49:39.311,00:00:01.337,,,,,,,,,,,"well can you go negative nine that's all",,,
00:49:39.311,00:49:40.798,00:00:01.487,,,,,,,,,,,"that is just add minus nine",,,
00:49:51.603,00:49:58.707,00:00:07.104,,,,,,,,,,,"so nine times nine would equal eighty-one",,,
00:49:58.707,00:50:05.332,00:00:06.625,,,,,,,,,,,"so nine divided by nine or eighty-one divided by nine would be nine",,,
00:50:06.330,00:50:06.470,00:00:00.140,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,,
00:50:07.896,00:50:09.293,00:00:01.397,,,,,,,,,,,"or minus nine (laughter) in this case",,,
00:50:09.523,00:50:14.292,00:00:04.769,,,,,,,,,,"yeah right we would add the minus",,,,
00:50:14.531,00:50:17.305,00:00:02.774,,,,,,,,"UL",,"okay that was quick good job",,,,
00:50:18.033,00:50:18.333,00:00:00.300,,,,,,,,,,,"okay okay",,,
00:50:18.333,00:50:21.286,00:00:02.953,,,,,,,,,,"this one's longer",,,,

00:50:34.915,00:50:36.741,00:00:01.826,,,,,,,,,,,"so ten minus ten equals zero",,,
00:50:36.741,00:50:39.365,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,,,"eighty-two minus ten equals seventy-two",,,
00:50:40.602,00:50:52.914,00:00:12.312,,,,,,,,,,"okay so we have seventy-two equals negative eight y",,,,
00:50:54.431,00:50:57.713,00:00:03.282,,,,,,,,,,,"so now we'd be getting rid of the negative eight",,,

00:50:59.240,00:51:03.490,00:00:04.250,,,,,,,,,,,"so negative eight equal or negative eight plus eight equals zero",,,
00:51:03.490,00:51:06.892,00:00:03.402,,,,,,,,,,,"so seventy-two plus eight equals eighty",,,
00:51:07.950,00:51:16.720,00:00:08.770,,,,,,,,,,"all right so y equals eighty",,,,

00:52:07.973,00:52:10.099,00:00:02.126,,,,,,,,,,,"I think it's sixty-two",,,
