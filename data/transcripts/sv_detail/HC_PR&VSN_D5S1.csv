00:03:41.739,00:03:45.480,00:00:03.741,,,,,,,,,"yeah so are you good at math or",,
00:03:46.278,00:03:48.653,00:00:02.375,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I'm okay",
00:03:48.653,00:03:51.955,00:00:03.302,,,,,,,,,,"surprisingly I have a b in the class which I did not think I have",
00:03:53.741,00:03:57.882,00:00:04.141,,,,,,,,,"oh well math is like my worst subject",,
00:03:58.421,00:04:01.903,00:00:03.482,,,,,,,,,"but I mean I understand like this stuff",,
00:04:01.903,00:04:08.697,00:00:06.794,,,,,,,,,"it's just that some of the algebra I'm getting into is just like pretty difficult for me you know",,
00:04:08.767,00:04:15.362,00:00:06.595,,,,,,,,,,"yeah they're like there's a point where it's not easy to make the transition to go to new math",
00:04:16.140,00:04:21.398,00:00:05.258,,,,,,,,,,"so you don't really have the best stuff to position on with",
00:04:21.957,00:04:23.793,00:00:01.836,,,,,,,,,"yeah I see what you're saying",,
00:04:25.190,00:04:30.777,00:00:05.587,,,,,,,,,,"so that I wish there was a better way you could do it like making the transitions",
00:04:31.745,00:04:43.299,00:00:11.554,,,,,,,,,"yeah it's like you know just like like one minute it's like the easiest thing ever like those graphs and then like pause filler",,
00:04:43.468,00:04:45.943,00:00:02.475,,,,,,,,,,"just like small multiplication division stuff",
00:04:45.993,00:04:48.178,00:00:02.185,,,,,,,,,"yeah and then all the sudden it's like pause filler",,
00:04:48.477,00:04:49.175,00:00:00.698,,,,,,,,,,"letters",

00:04:53.027,00:04:55.820,00:00:02.793,,,,,,,,,,"and I don't really understand most of it",

00:05:01.787,00:05:12.422,00:00:10.635,,,,,,,,,"but oh like there's just like this weird transition in like the middle of algebra like from algebra half to algebra one",,
00:05:13.360,00:05:15.555,00:00:02.195,,,,,,,,,"that is just ridiculous",,
00:05:16.344,00:05:16.673,00:00:00.329,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:05:18.429,00:05:22.968,00:00:04.539,,,,,,,,,"and you know sometimes it's really stressful for me you know",,
00:05:23.417,00:05:28.765,00:00:05.348,,,,,,,,,,"uh-huh like oh I don't like math",
00:05:28.765,00:05:30.252,00:00:01.487,,,,,,,,,"I don't like math",,
00:05:30.372,00:05:30.581,00:00:00.209,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:05:30.581,00:05:34.343,00:00:03.762,,,,,,,,,"I mean the only kid who likes math in my class",,
00:05:34.343,00:05:35.370,00:00:01.027,,,,,,,,,"his name is Jacob",,
00:05:36.308,00:05:39.990,00:00:03.682,,,,,,,,,"and he basically obsesses almost over every subject",,
00:05:39.990,00:05:44.410,00:00:04.420,,,,,,,,,"so I just couldn't talk about him",,
00:05:44.968,00:05:44.998,00:00:00.030,,,,,,,,,,"oh",
00:05:45.078,00:05:49.428,00:00:04.350,,,,,,,,,"it's like oh the most important thing is learning math and Latin",,
00:05:49.428,00:05:53.938,00:00:04.510,,,,,,,,,"and I was like what kind of person would want to talk in Latin about math",,
00:05:54.507,00:06:02.269,00:00:07.762,,,,,,,,,,"yeah we have like one kid I know she has I think like a ninety-eight in every class",

00:06:08.475,00:06:10.211,00:00:01.736,,,,,,,,,,"and all of her grades were ninety-eights",
00:06:12.646,00:06:14.711,00:00:02.065,,,,,,,,,,"she's insane in everything",
00:06:15.010,00:06:16.168,00:00:01.158,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know how she does it",
00:06:16.726,00:06:19.710,00:00:02.984,,,,,,,,,"I don't know how anyone does it to be perfectly honest",,
00:06:19.979,00:06:27.532,00:00:07.553,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so now everyone just idols her",
00:06:28.051,00:06:28.080,00:00:00.029,,,,,,,,,,"oh",

00:07:23.135,00:07:23.814,00:00:00.679,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:07:23.844,00:07:26.917,00:00:03.073,,,,,,,,,,"okay (inaudible) seems like thirteen or fourteen",
00:07:26.917,00:07:30.359,00:00:03.442,,,,,,,,,,"and we understand just for like popularity wise you have like a joke",
00:07:31.337,00:07:37.882,00:00:06.545,,,,,,,,,,"but it depends on really what you see in childhood to really watch the show",
00:07:38.441,00:07:46.383,00:00:07.942,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah I mean I was like he's like whatever he has in his computer out or his Xbox out",,
00:07:46.383,00:07:51.870,00:00:05.487,,,,,,,,,"and he has like a profile picture of like I don't know one of the weird things I",,
00:08:21.612,00:08:24.895,00:00:03.283,,,,,,,,,"all right",,
00:08:56.713,00:08:58.848,00:00:02.135,,,,,,,,,"all right roger that",,
00:08:59.027,00:08:59.656,00:00:00.629,,,,,,,,,,"all right",
00:08:59.736,00:09:05.154,00:00:05.418,,,,,,,,,"all right so pause filler ding it",,
00:09:06.071,00:09:14.472,00:00:08.401,,,,,,,,,"all right so basically pause filler all right so pause filler you see this problem here",,
00:09:15.141,00:09:15.370,00:00:00.229,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:09:15.370,00:09:19.012,00:00:03.642,,,,,,,,,"all right I'm writing good so",,
00:09:19.531,00:09:23.133,00:00:03.602,,,,,,,,,"all right so basically",,
00:09:26.355,00:09:28.660,00:00:02.305,,,,,,,,,"pause filler do you see the variable here",,
00:09:29.368,00:09:29.538,00:00:00.170,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:09:29.578,00:09:30.666,00:00:01.088,,,,,,,,,"okay why is my thing blue",,
00:09:32.561,00:09:33.539,00:00:00.978,,,,,,,,,,"was this supposed to be green",
00:09:34.277,00:09:34.746,00:00:00.469,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:09:34.746,00:09:38.328,00:00:03.582,,,,,,,,,"all right so see the variable over here",,
00:09:38.787,00:09:38.987,00:00:00.200,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:09:38.987,00:09:43.506,00:00:04.519,,,,,,,,,"basically what you have to do is that you have to get the variable by itself",,
00:09:44.883,00:09:52.446,00:00:07.563,,,,,,,,,"and pause filler the way you do that is by pause filler adding on both sides",,
00:09:53.424,00:10:00.448,00:00:07.024,,,,,,,,,"and it's sort of weird I know because math all right so",,
00:10:00.448,00:10:14.855,00:00:14.407,,,,,,,,,"pause filler what you do is that if you have a subtraction space there if you have sign that's subtracted pause filler what you do is that you write below it add that number",,
00:10:15.344,00:10:15.813,00:00:00.469,,,,,,,,,"you see",,
00:10:18.118,00:10:18.317,00:00:00.199,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:10:18.317,00:10:20.901,00:00:02.584,,,,,,,,,"so and then you'd add it to that side",,
00:10:20.901,00:10:24.214,00:00:03.313,,,,,,,,,"so you'd write plus number on the thirteen you",,
00:10:24.852,00:10:25.100,00:00:00.248,,,,,,,,,"see what I'm saying",,
00:10:25.100,00:10:25.591,00:00:00.491,,,,,,,,,"see what I'm saying","yeah",
00:10:25.591,00:10:26.329,00:00:00.738,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:10:26.578,00:10:27.407,00:00:00.829,,,,,,,,,"so try it out",,
00:10:27.806,00:10:29.991,00:00:02.185,,,,,,,,,,"so let's take a walk",
00:10:31.956,00:10:33.942,00:00:01.986,,,,,,,,,,"so here you'd be adding okay",
00:10:35.378,00:10:35.588,00:00:00.210,,,,,,,,,,"wow",
00:10:35.588,00:10:36.217,00:00:00.629,,,,,,,,,,"this is weird",
00:10:37.953,00:10:43.909,00:00:05.956,,,,,,,,,"oh it's all right yeah (laughter)",,
00:10:43.909,00:10:44.258,00:00:00.349,,,,,,,,,,"wow",
00:10:45.795,00:10:49.616,00:00:03.821,,,,,,,,,"oh no no no you don't add the x",,
00:10:49.756,00:10:51.592,00:00:01.836,,,,,,,,,"you add the six",,
00:10:51.592,00:10:52.929,00:00:01.337,,,,,,,,,,"oh that's right",
00:10:52.929,00:10:53.697,00:00:00.768,,,,,,,,,,"I can do that okay",
00:10:54.096,00:10:57.468,00:00:03.372,,,,,,,,,,"let's see I can undo this",
00:10:57.628,00:11:01.210,00:00:03.582,,,,,,,,,"like have you ever used one of these things before",,
00:11:01.589,00:11:01.998,00:00:00.409,,,,,,,,,,"no",
00:11:02.666,00:11:06.308,00:00:03.642,,,,,,,,,"oh man it works like a charm if you're trying to like draw on stuff",,
00:11:06.548,00:11:08.593,00:00:02.045,,,,,,,,,"but I have like a surface",,
00:11:08.793,00:11:12.215,00:00:03.422,,,,,,,,,"so basically what I do is that I get a Bluetooth mouse",,
00:11:12.614,00:11:16.545,00:00:03.931,,,,,,,,,"and I use that to draw most of the time",,
00:11:16.545,00:11:18.301,00:00:01.756,,,,,,,,,"but pause filler anyways let's just get back on topic",,
00:11:18.570,00:11:21.573,00:00:03.003,,,,,,,,,"so what you do is that you would add the number not the variable",,
00:11:21.653,00:11:23.798,00:00:02.145,,,,,,,,,"you want to get the variable by itself",,
00:11:24.138,00:11:24.497,00:00:00.359,,,,,,,,,,"uh-huh",
00:11:24.986,00:11:25.295,00:00:00.309,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:11:25.405,00:11:28.627,00:00:03.222,,,,,,,,,,"so then here would be the plus six",
00:11:28.887,00:11:32.189,00:00:03.302,,,,,,,,,,"and yeah I'll also add six",
00:11:32.908,00:11:33.377,00:00:00.469,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yes",,
00:11:33.377,00:11:33.766,00:00:00.389,,,,,,,,,"correct",,
00:11:34.175,00:11:37.268,00:00:03.093,,,,,,,,,,"okay so",
00:11:38.655,00:11:45.080,00:00:06.425,,,,,,,,,"pause filler basically pause filler just scratch out the six sort of like pause filler sort of like this",,
00:11:47.954,00:11:49.221,00:00:01.267,,,,,,,,,,"I see there we go",
00:11:51.974,00:11:55.037,00:00:03.063,,,,,,,,,"so just pretend that six doesn't exist anymore",,
00:11:56.015,00:11:56.334,00:00:00.319,,,,,,,,,,"right",
00:11:56.903,00:11:59.866,00:00:02.963,,,,,,,,,"oh and I'll rewrite that because I accidentally did it",,
00:11:59.946,00:12:02.680,00:00:02.734,,,,,,,,,"I was trying to",,
00:12:05.284,00:12:06.731,00:00:01.447,,,,,,,,,"oh whoops crap",,
00:12:09.834,00:12:13.775,00:00:03.941,,,,,,,,,"all right",,
00:12:15.301,00:12:18.654,00:00:03.353,,,,,,,,,"are you still scratching up the six now",,
00:12:18.654,00:12:25.578,00:00:06.924,,,,,,,,,"all you have to do is put a cross between the negative six and the plus six",,
00:12:26.127,00:12:29.768,00:00:03.641,,,,,,,,,"but you keep the six on the thirteen side as it is",,
00:12:30.227,00:12:33.759,00:00:03.532,,,,,,,,,,"right wait okay it asked me a question",
00:12:33.759,00:12:34.787,00:00:01.028,,,,,,,,,,"so I don't know why I did that",
00:12:36.134,00:12:38.289,00:00:02.155,,,,,,,,,"it went full screen on my Skype for a second",,
00:12:39.197,00:12:40.145,00:00:00.948,,,,,,,,,,"okay",
00:12:43.038,00:12:47.428,00:00:04.390,,,,,,,,,"okay so you see pause filler all you need to do is just add",,
00:12:49.045,00:12:51.310,00:00:02.265,,,,,,,,,,"so then this would be nineteen",
00:12:51.310,00:12:51.509,00:00:00.199,,,,,,,,,,"great",
00:12:51.509,00:12:51.838,00:00:00.329,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:12:52.696,00:12:58.733,00:00:06.037,,,,,,,,,,"we'll put a nine there and separate that",
00:12:58.733,00:13:03.911,00:00:05.178,,,,,,,,,"and then you'd write x sequels because that's the only thing left",,
00:13:04.579,00:13:09.648,00:00:05.069,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah so then okay yeah that's starting to make sense",
00:13:09.927,00:13:11.853,00:00:01.926,,,,,,,,,"yeah so now you're done",,
00:13:12.501,00:13:12.920,00:00:00.419,,,,,,,,,,"sweet",
00:13:14.906,00:13:17.280,00:00:02.374,,,,,,,,,,"so we go to the next problem right",
00:13:17.630,00:13:21.790,00:00:04.160,,,,,,,,,"yeah all right so that would be oh my gosh twenty-three",,
00:13:21.920,00:13:24.913,00:00:02.993,,,,,,,,,"all right this is going to be the end of me",,
00:13:24.913,00:13:34.162,00:00:09.249,,,,,,,,,"so all right so usually get a basic of this one right because all you have to do is just add again",,
00:13:34.162,00:13:35.788,00:00:01.626,,,,,,,,,"you just add to both sides",,
00:13:35.898,00:13:40.168,00:00:04.270,,,,,,,,,"so it's basically just do it again I guess it's a",,
00:13:40.418,00:13:44.129,00:00:03.711,,,,,,,,,,"it's good practice to fully understand it",
00:13:44.379,00:13:49.827,00:00:05.448,,,,,,,,,"yeah and the only difference here is that it's flipped",,
00:13:49.827,00:13:51.203,00:00:01.376,,,,,,,,,"and that it has a p",,
00:13:51.602,00:13:55.643,00:00:04.041,,,,,,,,,"I don't know how that's supposed to confuse us in anyway whatsoever but (laughter)",,
00:13:55.643,00:14:01.660,00:00:06.017,,,,,,,,,,"so I was going to cross that out because it's not really going to do much",
00:14:01.869,00:14:06.319,00:00:04.450,,,,,,,,,"yeah you could just cross at it first I mean pause filler yeah",,
00:14:09.681,00:14:23.879,00:00:14.198,,,,,,,,,"they write really weird on this paper because they have like oh I'm not allowed to showed it but they put like the nine after the p (laughter) like the plus eight after",,
00:14:24.448,00:14:25.346,00:00:00.898,,,,,,,,,"I don't know",,
00:14:25.795,00:14:27.351,00:00:01.556,,,,,,,,,,"that's strange",
00:14:27.471,00:14:28.090,00:00:00.619,,,,,,,,,"I know",,
00:14:28.908,00:14:30.853,00:00:01.945,,,,,,,,,"college students you know all right",,
00:14:30.853,00:14:31.133,00:00:00.280,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:14:31.881,00:14:33.757,00:00:01.876,,,,,,,,,"all right so you got that one",,
00:14:33.757,00:14:37.378,00:00:03.621,,,,,,,,,"I'm just going to do that to confirm it",,
00:14:37.688,00:14:38.426,00:00:00.738,,,,,,,,,"pause filler next page",,
00:14:39.953,00:14:42.098,00:00:02.145,,,,,,,,,,"this is subtraction right",
00:14:42.936,00:14:43.505,00:00:00.569,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:14:43.694,00:14:53.000,00:00:09.306,,,,,,,,,"all right so pause filler basically what you do is that instead of adding like we did before we subtract",,
00:14:53.000,00:14:53.901,00:00:00.901,,,,,,,,,"whoo",,
00:14:53.901,00:14:53.961,00:00:00.060,,,,,,,,,"whoo","yeah",
00:14:53.961,00:15:11.152,00:00:17.191,,,,,,,,,"and then (inaudible) because that's going to that's pause filler because that's a pause filler addition symbol",,
00:15:11.840,00:15:19.163,00:00:07.323,,,,,,,,,"pause filler and basically what you have to do is that you have to do the exact opposite of the symbol that's up there",,
00:15:19.253,00:15:19.642,00:00:00.389,,,,,,,,,"you see",,
00:15:20.331,00:15:20.900,00:00:00.569,,,,,,,,,,"yup",
00:15:21.209,00:15:22.396,00:00:01.187,,,,,,,,,"pause filler so basically",,
00:15:23.753,00:15:27.046,00:00:03.293,,,,,,,,,"pause filler it's really simple (laughter)",,
00:15:27.375,00:15:31.106,00:00:03.731,,,,,,,,,"and then you just do it the other side I mean",,
00:15:31.376,00:15:34.429,00:00:03.053,,,,,,,,,"and they also made it okay this time",,
00:15:34.429,00:15:37.053,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,"so that's the part that confused me the most",,
00:15:37.222,00:15:37.651,00:00:00.429,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:15:37.841,00:15:38.290,00:00:00.449,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:15:38.450,00:15:45.065,00:00:06.615,,,,,,,,,,"so this is basically just six equals k",
00:15:47.469,00:15:48.138,00:00:00.669,,,,,,,,,,"right",
00:15:48.257,00:15:48.587,00:00:00.330,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah",,
00:15:49.275,00:15:53.655,00:00:04.380,,,,,,,,,"we don't even need to do that much work for that one because that's like simple simple math",,

00:16:13.460,00:16:16.543,00:00:03.083,,,,,,,,,"all you have to do is divide",,
00:16:17.381,00:16:18.040,00:00:00.659,,,,,,,,,"and then you're done",,
00:16:18.040,00:16:20.883,00:00:02.843,,,,,,,,,,"I think I got it already",

00:16:23.308,00:16:24.914,00:00:01.606,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I saw it",
00:16:24.914,00:16:25.952,00:00:01.038,,,,,,,,,,"and then it came to me",
00:16:26.391,00:16:30.880,00:00:04.489,,,,,,,,,,"but I think I'll do the math just in case okay",
00:16:31.130,00:16:36.987,00:00:05.857,,,,,,,,,"yeah because they want you to do the math and stuff like that because they have like cameras all around us and stuff",,
00:16:37.964,00:16:39.232,00:00:01.268,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I don't like camearas",

00:16:53.838,00:17:00.194,00:00:06.356,,,,,,,,,,"so yeah it is kind of is five",

00:17:02.958,00:17:03.367,00:00:00.409,,,,,,,,,"pause filler five",,
00:17:04.255,00:17:07.118,00:00:02.863,,,,,,,,,"pause filler how explain your answer",,
00:17:07.537,00:17:09.612,00:00:02.075,,,,,,,,,,"okay I'll explain it in math",
00:17:12.486,00:17:12.785,00:00:00.299,,,,,,,,,,"got five",
00:17:13.863,00:17:18.353,00:00:04.490,,,,,,,,,,"it doesn't really look like a five",
00:17:18.782,00:17:19.690,00:00:00.908,,,,,,,,,,"so that's twenty",
00:17:19.690,00:17:20.957,00:00:01.267,,,,,,,,,,"so we got zero there",
00:17:21.356,00:17:21.924,00:00:00.568,,,,,,,,,,"no",
00:17:24.010,00:17:25.417,00:00:01.407,,,,,,,,,,"undo that",

00:17:28.420,00:17:29.717,00:00:01.297,,,,,,,,,,"okay there we go",
00:17:30.076,00:17:31.712,00:00:01.636,,,,,,,,,,"we put the zero there",
00:17:32.061,00:17:35.065,00:00:03.004,,,,,,,,,,"and then five times four is twenty",
00:17:35.065,00:17:39.904,00:00:04.839,,,,,,,,,,"so you have an extra two y two twenty",
00:17:39.944,00:17:41.001,00:00:01.057,,,,,,,,,,"hey it is right",
00:17:42.598,00:17:47.536,00:00:04.938,,,,,,,,,,"I do my math right right",
00:17:48.544,00:17:50.968,00:00:02.424,,,,,,,,,"pause filler hold on",,
00:17:52.176,00:17:52.724,00:00:00.548,,,,,,,,,"pause filler forty-four",,
00:17:52.724,00:17:55.159,00:00:02.435,,,,,,,,,"then we go into that",,

00:17:58.372,00:17:59.679,00:00:01.307,,,,,,,,,"yeah you're correct",,

00:18:01.095,00:18:07.052,00:00:05.957,,,,,,,,,"all right so basically what you do is that you'd say x equals five because pause filler the two twenty is gone",,
00:18:07.052,00:18:08.359,00:00:01.307,,,,,,,,,"and then the forty-four is gone",,
00:18:08.359,00:18:11.093,00:00:02.734,,,,,,,,,"so you just have to leave it at five so",,

00:19:15.107,00:19:15.596,00:00:00.489,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:19:16.734,00:19:19.338,00:00:02.604,,,,,,,,,,"let's see how we would oh wait so we would",
00:19:21.672,00:19:24.935,00:00:03.263,,,,,,,,,,"add nine to the negative nine and forty-one",
00:19:26.641,00:19:28.716,00:00:02.075,,,,,,,,,"we'd add nine to forty-one",,
00:19:28.716,00:19:31.799,00:00:03.083,,,,,,,,,"we wouldn't do anything with subtraction",,
00:19:33.376,00:19:41.068,00:00:07.692,,,,,,,,,,"right so plus because pause filler we're just doing the opposite on the other side",
00:19:41.427,00:19:42.246,00:00:00.819,,,,,,,,,,"we're not really",
00:19:43.473,00:19:49.858,00:00:06.385,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah so the negative nine really doesn't have any value to us as of right now",
00:19:49.858,00:19:52.871,00:00:03.013,,,,,,,,,"yeah and all you have to do is do it on the other side too",,
00:19:52.871,00:19:57.082,00:00:04.211,,,,,,,,,"and then just cross it out because it says they said we have to like show our work",,
00:19:57.082,00:19:58.798,00:00:01.716,,,,,,,,,"and that's why we typically do it",,
00:20:00.245,00:20:02.968,00:00:02.723,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so only teachers could explain it this simply",
00:20:03.467,00:20:07.398,00:00:03.931,,,,,,,,,"pause filler hearing it from a kid is like ten times better",,
00:20:07.927,00:20:09.045,00:00:01.118,,,,,,,,,,"yeah why",
00:20:09.045,00:20:10.851,00:00:01.806,,,,,,,,,,"I can't draw on this",
00:20:11.679,00:20:12.038,00:00:00.359,,,,,,,,,"oh",,
00:20:13.495,00:20:17.855,00:00:04.360,,,,,,,,,,"okay let's see",
00:20:18.204,00:20:18.932,00:00:00.728,,,,,,,,,,"here we go",
00:20:19.232,00:20:21.885,00:00:02.653,,,,,,,,,"whoops",,
00:20:21.885,00:20:23.512,00:00:01.627,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I'll draw another one",
00:20:23.851,00:20:24.440,00:00:00.589,,,,,,,,,"all right",,
00:20:24.539,00:20:24.949,00:00:00.410,,,,,,,,,,"here we go",
00:20:24.949,00:20:26.645,00:00:01.696,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah all right you got fifty",,
00:20:27.183,00:20:28.830,00:00:01.647,,,,,,,,,,"fifty and thirteen",
00:20:28.830,00:20:31.284,00:00:02.454,,,,,,,,,"and then here comes the trickier part",,
00:20:31.484,00:20:38.518,00:00:07.034,,,,,,,,,"you have (laughter) oh you have to pause filler divide fifty by thirteen",,
00:20:38.518,00:20:42.010,00:00:03.492,,,,,,,,,,"oh you got to be kidding me",
00:20:42.010,00:20:44.115,00:00:02.105,,,,,,,,,"which is actually pretty difficult",,
00:20:44.305,00:20:46.949,00:00:02.644,,,,,,,,,,"yeah because it doesn't go into any bits",
00:20:46.949,00:20:49.134,00:00:02.185,,,,,,,,,,"so you have to figure out what number it is",
00:20:50.650,00:20:55.901,00:00:05.251,,,,,,,,,"yeah so just I mean it will take a while because we're riding on this thing",,
00:20:55.901,00:20:55.935,00:00:00.034,,,,"SV2A",,,,,"yeah so just I mean it will take a while because we're riding on this thing",,
00:20:55.935,00:20:55.958,00:00:00.023,,"SV",,"SV2A",,,,,"yeah so just I mean it will take a while because we're riding on this thing",,
00:20:55.958,00:20:58.422,00:00:02.464,,"SV",,"SV2A",,,,,"and you're obviously a newbie to this sport",,
00:20:58.422,00:20:58.434,00:00:00.012,,"SV",,"SV2A",,,,,,,
00:20:58.991,00:21:05.466,00:00:06.475,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler might pause filler be a bit difficult",,
00:21:06.055,00:21:09.028,00:00:02.973,,,,,,,,,,"all right I'm going to wing it here",
00:21:09.388,00:21:12.969,00:00:03.581,,,,,,,,,,"and see where pause filler thirteen times five gets me",
00:21:13.937,00:21:17.539,00:00:03.602,,,,,,,,,,"and then I'll try to see how that goes",
00:21:18.048,00:21:19.235,00:00:01.187,,,,,,,,,"thirteen times five",,
00:21:19.235,00:21:20.183,00:00:00.948,,,,,,,,,"how does that work",,
00:21:20.283,00:21:26.598,00:00:06.315,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler well for me what I would do is that I would you know do the problem",
00:21:26.598,00:21:30.829,00:00:04.231,,,,,,,,,,"and if that's not the number I'd to go a little higher then to a little lower which then",
00:21:30.829,00:21:31.218,00:00:00.389,,,,,,,,,"oh",,
00:21:32.246,00:21:34.730,00:00:02.484,,,,,,,,,,"wow that's not it at all",
00:21:35.817,00:21:41.085,00:00:05.268,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I'm going to try four because four seems to be the magic number today",
00:21:43.340,00:21:46.403,00:00:03.063,,,,,,,,,,"all right do me some good",
00:21:48.848,00:21:50.484,00:00:01.636,,,,,,,,,,"okay that's not a twelve",
00:21:50.484,00:21:51.113,00:00:00.629,,,,,,,,,,"that's not a two",
00:21:51.113,00:21:52.869,00:00:01.756,,,,,,,,,"that's a twenty",,
00:21:52.869,00:21:54.695,00:00:01.826,,,,,,,,,"that's a z oh",,
00:21:55.373,00:21:56.890,00:00:01.517,,,,,,,,,,"it's something",
00:21:57.129,00:21:57.887,00:00:00.758,,,,,,,,,,"it's something",
00:21:59.344,00:21:59.933,00:00:00.589,,,,,,,,,"surely",,
00:22:00.841,00:22:01.339,00:00:00.498,,,,,,,,,,"so it",
00:22:01.759,00:22:02.517,00:00:00.758,,,,,,,,,,"wow",
00:22:02.826,00:22:04.412,00:00:01.586,,,,,,,,,,"that's actually really close",
00:22:05.739,00:22:08.044,00:00:02.305,,,,,,,,,,"so my guess it would be three because",
00:22:09.112,00:22:09.950,00:00:00.838,,,,,,,,,"I don't think it would be three",,
00:22:09.950,00:22:15.058,00:00:05.108,,,,,,,,,"it would have to be pause filler a decimal number because pause filler it's between three and four",,
00:22:15.258,00:22:19.129,00:00:03.871,,,,,,,,,"pause filler if you did three and if you did basic math you'd get thirty-nine",,
00:22:19.847,00:22:23.000,00:00:03.153,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so we would have so",
00:22:23.230,00:22:24.467,00:00:01.237,,,,,,,,,"you just have to divide",,
00:22:24.467,00:22:26.602,00:00:02.135,,,,,,,,,"I mean there's really no other way of doing it",,
00:22:27.121,00:22:29.515,00:00:02.394,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so we get there",
00:22:29.755,00:22:30.982,00:00:01.227,,,,,,,,,,"and it would be",
00:22:34.594,00:22:34.913,00:00:00.319,,,,,,,,,,"wow",
00:22:34.913,00:22:38.914,00:00:04.001,,,,,,,,,,"this okay so we would get eleven from this right",
00:22:39.323,00:22:40.760,00:00:01.437,,,,,,,,,,"if we were to subtract this",
00:22:42.366,00:22:43.384,00:00:01.018,,,,,,,,,,"I'm totally stumped",
00:22:43.384,00:22:44.771,00:00:01.387,,,,,,,,,,"I'm totally stumped",
00:22:44.771,00:22:48.053,00:00:03.282,,,,,,,,,"all right so let me tell you what you would do",,
00:22:48.502,00:22:51.815,00:00:03.313,,,,,,,,,"so basically what you would do is that you just write thirteen",,
00:22:52.583,00:22:53.411,00:00:00.828,,,,,,,,,"and undo that",,
00:22:53.690,00:22:55.556,00:00:01.866,,,,,,,,,"and then fifty",,
00:22:59.298,00:22:59.787,00:00:00.489,,,,,,,,,"all right",,
00:23:00.365,00:23:07.958,00:00:07.593,,,,,,,,,"and then what you do is that you try to find the highest number that's closest to this which is pause filler three",,
00:23:08.906,00:23:09.255,00:00:00.349,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:23:10.891,00:23:11.999,00:00:01.108,,,,,,,,,"and then you do that",,
00:23:11.999,00:23:13.256,00:00:01.257,,,,,,,,,"and you get thirty-nine",,
00:23:16.090,00:23:17.955,00:00:01.865,,,,,,,,,"and then you'd cross out the five",,
00:23:17.955,00:23:19.113,00:00:01.158,,,,,,,,,"and then you get the four",,
00:23:19.622,00:23:20.569,00:00:00.947,,,,,,,,,"and then you get that",,
00:23:21.118,00:23:23.652,00:00:02.534,,,,,,,,,"and then you get one hundred and ten",,
00:23:23.972,00:23:30.726,00:00:06.754,,,,,,,,,"and then what you'd have to do is you'd have to ridiculously try to find what one hundred and ten is",,
00:23:31.205,00:23:36.144,00:00:04.939,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler thirteen times",,
00:23:38.209,00:23:39.437,00:00:01.228,,,,,,,,,"pause filler let's try eight",,
00:23:40.454,00:23:41.651,00:00:01.197,,,,,,,,,"pause filler twenty-four",,
00:23:45.593,00:23:46.620,00:00:01.027,,,,,,,,,"pause filler one zero four",,
00:23:46.740,00:23:47.538,00:00:00.798,,,,,,,,,"that's correct",,
00:23:48.047,00:23:56.428,00:00:08.381,,,,,,,,,"so it would be eight and one zero four pause filler oh six",,
00:23:59.531,00:24:00.289,00:00:00.758,,,,,,,,,"sixty",,
00:24:01.227,00:24:06.854,00:00:05.627,,,,,,,,,"now if you we're going to get an answer like this it's going to be like infinite all right",,
00:24:07.343,00:24:07.602,00:00:00.259,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:24:08.041,00:24:11.304,00:00:03.263,,,,,,,,,"pause filler what we're going to do is that we're going to get this",,
00:24:11.653,00:24:12.701,00:00:01.048,,,,,,,,,"and then we're going to do it",,
00:24:12.741,00:24:14.656,00:00:01.915,,,,,,,,,"we're going to get one more decimal number",,
00:24:15.085,00:24:20.214,00:00:05.129,,,,,,,,,"and if it's above five we just set it to the number above it",,
00:24:20.214,00:24:23.876,00:00:03.662,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler let's say we get seven",,
00:24:26.230,00:24:29.203,00:00:02.973,,,,,,,,,"pause filler we get like three point seven eight",,
00:24:29.612,00:24:32.426,00:00:02.814,,,,,,,,,"if this number is four we don't have to change it",,
00:24:33.095,00:24:38.053,00:00:04.958,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah because it rounds up or down depending on the number and then the last of it",
00:24:38.173,00:24:41.256,00:00:03.083,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah and so basically this is just going to be a rounding thing",,
00:24:44.708,00:24:47.222,00:00:02.514,,,,,,,,,"and yeah so pause filler",,
00:24:50.445,00:24:51.433,00:00:00.988,,,,,,,,,"thirteen",,
00:24:53.458,00:24:55.045,00:00:01.587,,,,,,,,,,"and sixteen",
00:24:57.908,00:24:59.056,00:00:01.148,,,,,,,,,,"wouldn't that be four then",
00:24:59.425,00:25:00.432,00:00:01.007,,,,,,,,,"it would have",,
00:25:02.677,00:25:04.912,00:00:02.235,,,,,,,,,,"yeah because thirteen times four is fifty-two",
00:25:06.688,00:25:09.661,00:00:02.973,,,,,,,,,"yeah right you're looking at your previous work",,
00:25:09.671,00:25:11.108,00:00:01.437,,,,,,,,,"and I'm not (laughter)",,
00:25:11.108,00:25:14.032,00:00:02.924,,,,,,,,,"all right and then fifty-two",,
00:25:14.032,00:25:15.817,00:00:01.785,,,,,,,,,"oh I'm going off the page ding it",,
00:25:16.227,00:25:17.633,00:00:01.406,,,,,,,,,"and then that would be eight",,
00:25:19.449,00:25:21.036,00:00:01.587,,,,,,,,,"and then that would be eighty",,
00:25:21.036,00:25:25.027,00:00:03.991,,,,,,,,,"so it's obviously a number higher than five you see",,
00:25:25.116,00:25:27.880,00:00:02.764,,,,,,,,,"so this would round to",,
00:25:28.788,00:25:29.975,00:00:01.187,,,,,,,,,,"three point eight five",
00:25:30.414,00:25:31.282,00:00:00.868,,,,,,,,,"yeah correct",,
00:25:31.711,00:25:32.330,00:00:00.619,,,,,,,,,,"all right",
00:25:34.295,00:25:36.381,00:00:02.086,,,,,,,,,"oh do you know what I just realized",,
00:25:36.590,00:25:37.019,00:00:00.429,,,,,,,,,,"what",
00:25:38.496,00:25:45.809,00:00:07.313,,,,,,,,,"what we could've done this is going to sound really really bad pause filler",,
00:25:46.967,00:25:53.073,00:00:06.106,,,,,,,,,"basically what we could've done is that we could've just done this",,
00:25:54.160,00:26:06.602,00:00:12.442,,,,,,,,,"and then we could've just stopped",,
00:26:06.841,00:26:08.318,00:00:01.477,,,,,,,,,,"(laughter) oh wow",
00:26:08.318,00:26:10.194,00:00:01.876,,,,,,,,,"oh we overcomplicated the problem",,
00:26:10.443,00:26:11.501,00:00:01.058,,,,,,,,,,"yeah oh my gosh",
00:26:11.920,00:26:18.435,00:00:06.515,,,,,,,,,"all right but I think we showed enough work on this page already",,
00:26:18.864,00:26:19.303,00:00:00.439,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:26:19.423,00:26:20.000,00:00:00.577,,,,,,,,,,"there's nothing (inaudible)",

00:26:27.634,00:26:28.063,00:00:00.429,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:26:28.732,00:26:31.625,00:00:02.893,,,,,,,,,"oh I am a great tutor",,
00:26:31.625,00:26:33.122,00:00:01.497,,,,,,,,,"all right next page",,
00:26:34.638,00:26:38.400,00:00:03.762,,,,,,,,,"all right oh",,
00:26:38.400,00:26:41.014,00:00:02.614,,,,,,,,,,"okay I think I got this",
00:26:41.014,00:26:41.972,00:00:00.958,,,,,,,,,,"let's see if I can get this",
00:26:41.972,00:26:42.441,00:00:00.469,,,,,,,,,"all right",,
00:26:46.102,00:26:49.864,00:00:03.762,,,,,,,,,,"wait not it kept cutting out",
00:26:49.864,00:26:51.929,00:00:02.065,,,,,,,,,,"I have no idea why the pen cuts out",

00:36:19.250,00:36:25.745,00:00:06.495,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you have the x here",
00:36:26.164,00:36:29.686,00:00:03.522,,,,,,,,,,"the idea is you want to leave that x alone and don't touch it",
00:36:30.754,00:36:34.415,00:00:03.661,,,,,,,,,,"you want to actually add three to this three so",
00:36:36.151,00:36:41.220,00:00:05.069,,,,,,,,,"what if I heard this before",,
00:36:41.888,00:36:43.924,00:00:02.036,,,,,,,,,,"so yeah you pause filler add three",
00:36:44.323,00:36:47.276,00:00:02.953,,,,,,,,,,"and that gets you zero",
00:36:48.074,00:36:52.175,00:00:04.101,,,,,,,,,,"and yeah so then you know what to do from here right",
00:36:52.574,00:36:54.849,00:00:02.275,,,,,,,,,"pause filler maybe I'll check later",,
00:36:55.567,00:36:58.920,00:00:03.353,,,,,,,,,,"all right yeah so show me what you know",
00:36:58.920,00:37:02.332,00:00:03.412,,,,,,,,,"all right so pause filler basically what I get twenty-five",,
00:37:02.332,00:37:03.060,00:00:00.728,,,,,,,,,"and then I'm done",,
00:37:04.447,00:37:05.715,00:00:01.268,,,,,,,,,,"yeah twenty-five equals x",
00:37:05.715,00:37:05.784,00:00:00.069,,,,,,,"UL",,,"yeah twenty-five equals x",
00:37:05.784,00:37:06.911,00:00:01.127,,,,,,,"UL",,,". that is good",
00:37:06.911,00:37:06.931,00:00:00.020,,,,,,,"UL",,,"I'm going to put a checkmark yay",

00:37:09.934,00:37:11.760,00:00:01.826,,,,,,,,,"all right we did it",,
00:37:11.760,00:37:13.586,00:00:01.826,,,,,,,,,"oh what page",,
00:37:13.846,00:37:19.972,00:00:06.126,,,,,,,,,,"okay so see if you do another one like this again",
00:37:20.022,00:37:24.781,00:00:04.759,,,,,,,,,"all right but this one we haven't done before",,
00:37:25.479,00:37:26.587,00:00:01.108,,,,,,,,,"do you know how to do this one",,
00:37:27.036,00:37:27.315,00:00:00.279,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:37:27.634,00:37:29.191,00:00:01.557,,,,,,,,,"all right so tell me",,
00:37:29.979,00:37:33.840,00:00:03.861,,,,,,,,,"oh I went into full screen",,
00:37:33.840,00:37:35.816,00:00:01.976,,,,,,,,,"(laughter) all right I'm good now",,
00:37:37.093,00:37:37.522,00:00:00.429,,,,,,,,,,"all right",
00:37:40.784,00:37:42.261,00:00:01.477,,,,,,,,,,"so wait",
00:37:45.673,00:37:47.040,00:00:01.367,,,,,,,,,,"okay yeah all right",
00:37:47.190,00:37:52.807,00:00:05.617,,,,,,,,,,"let's go",
00:37:53.226,00:37:55.361,00:00:02.135,,,,,,,,,,"you're going to go",
00:37:55.421,00:37:57.127,00:00:01.706,,,,,,,,,"we didn't do this one yet",,
00:37:57.127,00:37:58.205,00:00:01.078,,,,,,,,,"so you have to touch me how to do it",,
00:37:58.205,00:37:59.482,00:00:01.277,,,,,,,,,,"all right all right",
00:37:59.821,00:38:01.368,00:00:01.547,,,,,,,,,"I know how to do it but (inaudible)",,
00:38:01.447,00:38:03.363,00:00:01.916,,,,,,,,,,"okay so",
00:38:03.363,00:38:04.411,00:00:01.048,,,,,,,,,"we have to do it",,
00:38:04.411,00:38:05.019,00:00:00.608,,,,,,,,,"I'm sorry",,
00:38:05.887,00:38:08.541,00:00:02.654,,,,,,,,,,"so for this you want the y to be positive",
00:38:08.541,00:38:12.552,00:00:04.011,,,,,,,,,,"so you're actually going to add a y to the y okay",
00:38:12.742,00:38:14.258,00:00:01.516,,,,,,,,,,"I'll (inaudible) for a second",
00:38:15.426,00:38:20.843,00:00:05.417,,,,,,,,,,"and here you're also going to subtract the eighteen",
00:38:20.843,00:38:23.188,00:00:02.345,,,,,,,,,,"so you can do that",
00:38:24.246,00:38:34.901,00:00:10.655,,,,,,,,,,"so whenever you have like one positive number without positive or negative the idea is to get you want to add the opposite of that",
00:38:35.071,00:38:39.022,00:00:03.951,,,,,,,,,,"so you actually want to subtract eighteen from the eighteen",
00:38:39.281,00:38:40.628,00:00:01.347,,,,,,,,,,"and get zero",
00:38:40.628,00:38:44.899,00:00:04.271,,,,,,,,,,"but then you'd also going to subtract that eighteen from the twenty-three",
00:38:46.724,00:38:53.170,00:00:06.446,,,,,,,,,"actually I think what you do pause filler is that you'd subtract the twenty-three",,
00:38:53.240,00:38:54.267,00:00:01.027,,,,,,,,,"not the eighteen",,
00:38:55.784,00:38:57.630,00:00:01.846,,,,,,,,,"because you want to get y on this side",,
00:38:58.997,00:38:59.386,00:00:00.389,,,,,,,,,"right",,
00:39:00.623,00:39:00.902,00:00:00.279,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:39:01.202,00:39:02.708,00:00:01.506,,,,,,,,,"oh all right yeah",,
00:39:02.708,00:39:04.494,00:00:01.786,,,,,,,,,"and then you do that",,
00:39:04.494,00:39:06.869,00:00:02.375,,,,,,,,,"and then you did twenty-three",,
00:39:07.328,00:39:09.094,00:00:01.766,,,,,,,,,"and then you'd minus twenty-three",,
00:39:09.233,00:39:10.261,00:00:01.028,,,,,,,,,"ops that's a two",,
00:39:10.261,00:39:11.847,00:00:01.586,,,,,,,,,"all right and then op",,
00:39:14.322,00:39:18.383,00:00:04.061,,,,,,,,,"then this is what my homework looks like so (laughter)",,
00:39:18.532,00:39:20.777,00:00:02.245,,,,,,,,,,"so you do that",
00:39:20.997,00:39:23.810,00:00:02.813,,,,,,,,,"yeah pause filler and then you get negative five",,
00:39:23.930,00:39:25.646,00:00:01.716,,,,,,,,,"and then you get y",,
00:39:26.374,00:39:28.190,00:00:01.816,,,,,,,,,"and then that's what it equals",,
00:39:28.337,00:39:28.370,00:00:00.033,,,,,,,"UL",,,,
00:39:28.370,00:39:30.505,00:00:02.135,,,,,,,"UL",,,"all right yeah that's good",
00:39:30.505,00:39:30.532,00:00:00.027,,,,,,,"UL",,,,
00:39:31.553,00:39:32.171,00:00:00.618,,,,,,,,,,"go with",
00:39:32.421,00:39:32.959,00:00:00.538,,,,,,,,,"I mean",,
00:39:32.959,00:39:34.426,00:00:01.467,,,,,,,,,"oh my god",,
00:39:34.426,00:39:35.504,00:00:01.078,,,,,,,,,"what is that a v",,
00:39:35.983,00:39:37.509,00:00:01.526,,,,,,,,,,"it's supposed to be a checkmark",
00:39:37.509,00:39:40.851,00:00:03.342,,,,,,,,,,"it's not like the pencil where mine just keep drawing out",
00:39:41.021,00:39:41.410,00:00:00.389,,,,,,,,,,"here we go",
00:39:41.410,00:39:42.119,00:00:00.709,,,,,,,,,"oh there you go",,
00:39:42.298,00:39:42.957,00:00:00.659,,,,,,,,,"there you got it",,
00:39:43.216,00:39:46.668,00:00:03.452,,,,,,,,,,"to complete checkmark thing all right",
00:39:49.711,00:39:50.280,00:00:00.569,,,,,,,,,,"oh wow",
00:39:50.280,00:39:52.415,00:00:02.135,,,,,,,,,,"okay let's see with this one now",
00:39:54.401,00:40:03.161,00:00:08.760,,,,,,,,,,"so here it's going to be confusing because now you have two variables and two numbers pause filler on different sides",
00:40:03.680,00:40:08.628,00:00:04.948,,,,,,,,,,"so one of the first things you actually want to do is you want to add k to both sides",
00:40:09.337,00:40:14.305,00:00:04.968,,,,,,,,,,"so yeah each k is going to receive a k",
00:40:15.413,00:40:19.923,00:00:04.510,,,,,,,,,,"and the positive k is going to become two k you know",
00:40:19.923,00:40:25.600,00:00:05.677,,,,,,,,,"ah yeah like has a y2k robot is taking over right yeah",,
00:40:25.969,00:40:28.124,00:00:02.155,,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah stuff like that",
00:40:28.124,00:40:28.453,00:00:00.329,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:40:29.401,00:40:31.327,00:00:01.926,,,,,,,,,,"and so you can go ahead",
00:40:31.327,00:40:32.075,00:00:00.748,,,,,,,,,,"and can do that",
00:40:34.041,00:40:35.926,00:00:01.885,,,,,,,,,"oh what not a two",,
00:40:35.926,00:40:39.738,00:00:03.812,,,,,,,,,"I don't want a two",,
00:40:41.294,00:40:44.148,00:00:02.854,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler hitting undo in this thing is so hard",
00:40:44.886,00:40:46.163,00:00:01.277,,,,,,,,,"pause filler it's easy for me",,
00:40:46.163,00:40:47.340,00:00:01.177,,,,,,,,,"you just got to get used to it",,
00:40:48.039,00:40:48.368,00:00:00.329,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:40:49.096,00:40:50.713,00:00:01.617,,,,,,,,,"pause filler and then you get two k",,
00:40:52.080,00:40:54.644,00:00:02.564,,,,,,,,,"well that was like I've been drawing like perfect ks",,
00:40:54.644,00:40:55.402,00:00:00.758,,,,,,,,,"I'm on a streak",,
00:40:56.100,00:40:59.493,00:00:03.393,,,,,,,,,"so then what I do is minus thirty-six",,
00:40:59.812,00:41:00.710,00:00:00.898,,,,,,,,,,"that's right",
00:41:01.798,00:41:03.354,00:00:01.556,,,,,,,,,"minus thirty-six",,
00:41:07.036,00:41:14.499,00:00:07.463,,,,,,,,,"and then that would be negative fifty equals two k and then two k",,
00:41:15.676,00:41:18.410,00:00:02.734,,,,,,,,,"but not the k I don't want that so",,
00:41:18.410,00:41:19.936,00:00:01.526,,,,,,,,,"and then you divide that by two",,
00:41:20.365,00:41:22.770,00:00:02.405,,,,,,,,,"but then two divided by fifty",,
00:41:26.002,00:41:28.637,00:00:02.635,,,,,,,,,"pause filler two four pause filler",,
00:41:29.924,00:41:33.944,00:00:04.020,,,,,,,,,,"twenty-five",
00:41:35.032,00:41:37.786,00:00:02.754,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah I forgot",,
00:41:37.955,00:41:38.793,00:00:00.838,,,,,,,,,"twenty-five",,
00:41:38.793,00:41:43.363,00:00:04.570,,,,,,,,,"and then k equals twenty-five",,
00:41:45.279,00:41:49.150,00:00:03.871,,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah that's correct",
00:41:49.150,00:41:51.874,00:00:02.724,,,,,,,,,,"all right so we got this page down",

00:49:15.585,00:49:17.930,00:00:02.345,,,,,,,,,"that's negative all right",,

00:49:23.497,00:49:24.036,00:00:00.539,,,,,,,,,"really",,
00:49:24.435,00:49:28.586,00:00:04.151,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so fourteen times two is twenty-eight",
00:49:29.115,00:49:30.851,00:00:01.736,,,,,,,,,,"and add another fourteen",
00:49:30.851,00:49:36.707,00:00:05.856,,,,,,,,,,"and you get forty-two",

00:49:41.836,00:49:44.729,00:00:02.893,,,,,,,,,,"well that answer is correct",
00:49:44.729,00:49:47.483,00:00:02.754,,,,,,,,,,"but to fully simplify you would have pause filler",
00:49:47.483,00:49:47.583,00:00:00.100,,,,,,,,,,"three",
00:49:47.583,00:49:48.091,00:00:00.508,,,,,,,,,,"right",
