00:15:23.554,00:15:23.873,00:00:00.319,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:15:25.230,00:15:28.931,00:00:03.701,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then what's this",,,,

00:15:37.193,00:15:39.817,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler because you're supposed to multiply the ys right",,,
00:15:40.016,00:15:42.670,00:00:02.654,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you multiply y here",,,
00:15:42.670,00:15:44.376,00:00:01.706,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and the y would cancel out",,,
00:15:44.676,00:15:46.501,00:00:01.825,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and those two multiply on this side",,,
00:15:47.040,00:15:49.325,00:00:02.285,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and maybe you just add y seventy",,,
00:15:49.904,00:15:56.369,00:00:06.465,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler right so pause filler what you do is that correct",,,,

00:16:05.927,00:16:10.896,00:00:04.969,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so one hundred and forty over three",,,,
00:16:11.355,00:16:14.099,00:00:02.744,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you're dividing three by one hundred four",,,,
00:16:14.099,00:16:15.685,00:00:01.586,,,,,,,,,,,,"and four divided by three",,,,
00:16:15.685,00:16:17.730,00:00:02.045,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right do what you're doing there here",,,,
00:16:20.414,00:16:20.763,00:00:00.349,,,,,,,,,,,,,"where",,,

00:16:44.440,00:16:46.435,00:00:01.995,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and we're going to have a left over two",,,
00:16:49.458,00:16:50.725,00:00:01.267,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you can't even really see it from here",,,
00:16:50.725,00:16:52.611,00:00:01.886,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because the bar down here blocks it",,,
00:16:53.310,00:16:53.908,00:00:00.598,,,,,,,,,,,,"what bar",,,,
00:16:54.397,00:16:59.515,00:00:05.118,,,,,,,,,,,,,"there's a bar that moves the screen side to side",,,

00:17:21.715,00:17:28.290,00:00:06.575,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ah that is odd pause filler",,,
00:17:33.578,00:17:50.849,00:00:17.271,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler well can you fit the rest of the problem there",,,,

00:17:59.918,00:18:05.954,00:00:06.036,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm going to move it over here and have the twenty",,,
00:18:06.064,00:18:08.479,00:00:02.415,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait wait wait there",,,,
00:18:09.676,00:18:13.946,00:00:04.270,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so we're going to have the twenty over here",,,
00:18:15.193,00:18:17.448,00:00:02.255,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then minus the eighteen",,,
00:18:18.925,00:18:20.302,00:00:01.377,,,,,,,,,,,,"no that's infinite pause filler",,,,
00:18:20.930,00:18:23.475,00:00:02.545,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so then you would have two over three because",,,
00:18:23.475,00:18:25.470,00:00:01.995,,,,,,,,,,,,"you'd put the line over the three",,,,
00:18:28.603,00:18:30.968,00:00:02.365,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no but wouldn't that be with decimals",,,

00:18:40.237,00:18:42.890,00:00:02.653,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I'm a little confused",,,
00:18:42.960,00:18:49.875,00:00:06.915,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think if it's infinite you just put like two over three to show that it can never be simplified to a whole number",,,
00:18:49.934,00:18:51.750,00:00:01.816,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so that's what I was thinking",,,,
00:18:51.750,00:18:54.005,00:00:02.255,,,,,,,,,,,,"so just write the",,,,
00:18:54.424,00:18:59.523,00:00:05.099,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so in the end I got like negative forty-six to over three equalsy",,,
00:18:59.842,00:19:01.488,00:00:01.646,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",,,,
00:19:02.875,00:19:03.434,00:00:00.559,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,
00:19:03.953,00:19:06.826,00:00:02.873,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right (inaudible) but that's over right",,,,
00:19:06.826,00:19:07.495,00:00:00.669,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right pause filler",,,,
00:19:08.492,00:19:12.354,00:00:03.862,,,,,,,,,,,,"that's a really good checkmark",,,,
00:19:12.354,00:19:14.499,00:00:02.145,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah all right",,,
00:19:14.858,00:19:15.297,00:00:00.439,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,
00:19:16.145,00:19:21.822,00:00:05.677,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right what you do is you subtract thirteen basically",,,,
00:19:22.391,00:19:25.015,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,,,,"because this is a plus you see",,,,
00:19:25.963,00:19:26.232,00:00:00.269,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:19:27.300,00:19:27.669,00:00:00.369,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:19:28.487,00:19:36.409,00:00:07.922,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so well technically what I could just do here is that I can just wipe whoa I can just wipe about the thirteen and then",,,
00:19:36.638,00:19:37.915,00:00:01.277,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh why is that weird",,,
00:19:38.823,00:19:43.303,00:00:04.480,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and I can just turn the forty-four into a thirty-one",,,
00:19:45.458,00:19:47.164,00:00:01.706,,,,,,,,,,,,,"that saves up a whole lot of room",,,
00:19:47.683,00:19:48.362,00:00:00.679,,,,,,,,,,,,"indeed",,,,
00:19:53.759,00:19:56.962,00:00:03.203,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I want to redo that and pause filler",,,
00:19:57.840,00:20:00.464,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay no give me my two",,,
00:20:00.734,00:20:06.939,00:00:06.205,,,,,,,,,,,,,"there we go there there okay",,,
00:20:07.029,00:20:07.588,00:00:00.559,,,,,,,,,,,,,"stay there",,,
00:20:08.775,00:20:12.387,00:00:03.612,,,,,,,,,,,,,"now we need to multiply the x",,,
00:20:13.554,00:20:19.082,00:00:05.528,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so technically we would get one over two would equal thirty",,,
00:20:22.524,00:20:29.618,00:00:07.094,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so now we have to bring the thirty-one over to the one over two and multiply that to get the",,,
00:20:31.075,00:20:31.713,00:00:00.638,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler hold on",,,,
00:20:32.841,00:20:41.082,00:00:08.241,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right you got thirty-one over two right",,,,
00:20:41.461,00:20:41.730,00:00:00.269,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:20:42.209,00:20:42.658,00:00:00.449,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,,
00:20:43.287,00:20:52.636,00:00:09.349,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then fifteen one over two",,,
00:20:52.636,00:20:53.713,00:00:01.077,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because you got one left",,,
00:20:54.352,00:20:57.874,00:00:03.522,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well gave me an extra line",,,
00:21:00.777,00:21:02.014,00:00:01.237,,,,,,,,,,,,,"just give me that",,,

00:21:45.765,00:21:47.830,00:00:02.065,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so eliminate that",,,
00:21:47.830,00:21:49.257,00:00:01.427,,,,,,,,,,,,,"we're just going to add sixteen",,,
00:21:49.257,00:21:53.028,00:00:03.771,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that becomes forty-seven",,,
00:21:58.725,00:22:00.551,00:00:01.826,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so multiply the x",,,

00:46:13.878,00:46:15.335,00:00:01.457,,,,,,,,,,,,,"this actually cancels it out",,,
00:46:15.335,00:46:21.710,00:00:06.375,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you would have four equals sixty-two k",,,
00:46:21.710,00:46:24.913,00:00:03.203,,,,,,,,,,,,,"now you have to simplify it from there",,,

00:47:05.880,00:47:08.823,00:00:02.943,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"because they put out mic for recording things when",,,
00:47:08.823,00:47:11.298,00:00:02.475,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"all right I pulled up the calculator",,,,
00:47:11.298,00:47:11.936,00:00:00.638,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"let's go",,,,
00:47:11.936,00:47:14.341,00:00:02.405,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"all right so",,,,

00:47:15.997,00:47:19.539,00:00:03.542,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's only eighteen it's eighteen",,,
00:47:19.539,00:47:26.663,00:00:07.124,,,,,,,,,,,,"no it's actually point zero six four is five one one six one two nine zero three two two five eight one",,,,
00:47:28.519,00:47:28.788,00:00:00.269,,,,,,,,,,,,,"what",,,
00:47:29.476,00:47:31.133,00:00:01.657,,,,,,,,,,,,"that's actually what it is",,,,

00:47:34.525,00:47:35.882,00:00:01.357,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well I'm thinking eighteen here",,,
00:47:35.882,00:47:38.197,00:00:02.315,,,,,,,,,,,,,"because I don't have any decimal things or none before",,,
00:47:38.197,00:47:40.581,00:00:02.384,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay it's eighteen k equals eighteen",,,,

00:47:43.894,00:47:57.253,00:00:13.359,,,,,,,,,,,,,"now this one pause filler I'm going to give you a little pause filler sneak peak here in order to get this out pretty fast",,,
00:47:57.253,00:48:01.025,00:00:03.772,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you're going to multiply each sides by y",,,
00:48:01.025,00:48:02.851,00:00:01.826,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so this y cancels out y",,,
00:48:02.851,00:48:09.795,00:00:06.944,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you actually are going to add a y what y",,,
00:48:10.234,00:48:10.463,00:00:00.229,,,,,,,,,,,,"no no",,,,
00:48:10.902,00:48:11.391,00:00:00.489,,,,,,,,,,,,"there",,,,
00:48:11.391,00:48:16.240,00:00:04.849,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and then we're going to add y to the two ten",,,
00:48:17.487,00:48:20.241,00:00:02.754,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so yeah wait yeah",,,
00:48:20.241,00:48:24.412,00:00:04.171,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then you basically know what pause filler you get there",,,
00:48:25.349,00:48:28.293,00:00:02.944,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then all you need to do is just simplify the answer",,,
00:48:33.591,00:48:33.990,00:00:00.399,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh okay",,,
00:48:36.075,00:48:36.923,00:00:00.848,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm just using the highlighter",,,,
00:48:37.113,00:48:39.856,00:00:02.743,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so wait",,,,
00:48:39.916,00:48:40.465,00:00:00.549,,,,,,,,,,,,"hold on",,,,

00:48:57.317,00:49:02.385,00:00:05.068,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"no apparently this is another glitch where it won't erase this",,,,
00:49:02.385,00:49:03.533,00:00:01.148,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"so I'm just going to do that",,,,
00:49:03.533,00:49:09.170,00:00:05.637,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right all right so I think what you're missing here is that",,,,
00:49:09.509,00:49:13.520,00:00:04.011,,,,,,,,,,,,"we have to put the y here and the negative fourteen there",,,,
00:49:14.598,00:49:16.753,00:00:02.155,,,,,,,,,,,,,"well actually if you would do that",,,
00:49:17.371,00:49:19.736,00:00:02.365,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you would have fourteen y",,,
00:49:19.826,00:49:22.719,00:00:02.893,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but negative fourteen y was negative fourteen y",,,
00:49:23.627,00:49:24.695,00:00:01.068,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh",,,,
00:49:25.533,00:49:27.837,00:00:02.304,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so if you were actually to multiply the ys here",,,
00:49:29.613,00:49:33.066,00:00:03.453,,,,,,,,,,,,,"they would cancel out for some reason I do not know the whereabouts of",,,
00:49:34.442,00:49:36.787,00:00:02.345,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you just multiply it here",,,
00:49:36.787,00:49:37.446,00:00:00.659,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and you get y",,,
00:49:37.446,00:49:39.840,00:00:02.394,,,,,,,,,,,,"all righty then pause filler",,,,
00:49:40.968,00:49:44.410,00:00:03.442,,,,,,,,,,,,,"only if it works",,,
00:49:44.520,00:49:47.253,00:00:02.733,,,,,,,,,,,,,"only if this explain to me why what happened",,,
00:49:47.742,00:49:51.035,00:00:03.293,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I would understand it better",,,
00:49:51.184,00:49:53.040,00:00:01.856,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"pause filler well these are college students",,,,
00:49:53.040,00:49:55.854,00:00:02.814,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"and they just rigged this up just for us",,,,
00:49:56.093,00:49:57.231,00:00:01.138,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"yay",,,
00:49:57.231,00:50:00.773,00:00:03.542,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right and then we put y here right",,,,
00:50:01.062,00:50:01.461,00:00:00.399,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:50:02.509,00:50:05.791,00:00:03.282,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right and then I do that's a perfect one",,,,
00:50:06.769,00:50:10.201,00:00:03.432,,,,,,,,"LPB",,,,,"yeah that actually is that's a pretty decent line",,,
00:50:10.201,00:50:12.905,00:00:02.704,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't see any curves or anything",,,
00:50:16.617,00:50:22.184,00:00:05.567,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then what you do here is negative fourteen negative fourteen",,,,
00:50:23.541,00:50:28.290,00:00:04.749,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"calculator calculator",,,,
00:50:28.569,00:50:31.094,00:00:02.525,,,,,,,,,,,,,"honestly I don't even know the answer to this",,,
00:50:31.243,00:50:35.424,00:00:04.181,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but I do have a sort of answer to it",,,
00:50:36.671,00:50:41.720,00:00:05.049,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so it's two ten divided by four two",,,,
00:50:43.186,00:50:43.924,00:00:00.738,,,,,,,,,,,,,"negative fourteen",,,
00:50:43.924,00:50:46.658,00:00:02.734,,,,,,,,,,,,"so I got fifteen negative fifteen",,,,
00:50:46.938,00:50:49.532,00:00:02.594,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so you have negative fifteen equals y yeah",,,
00:50:52.764,00:50:54.041,00:00:01.277,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah look at that",,,,
00:50:54.421,00:50:57.304,00:00:02.883,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah oh (sfx)",,,,
00:50:59.749,00:51:01.115,00:00:01.366,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",,,
00:51:01.175,00:51:03.121,00:00:01.946,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right all right",,,,
00:51:03.121,00:51:07.042,00:00:03.921,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have another basic understanding of what I'm supposed to do here",,,,

00:51:09.157,00:51:12.510,00:00:03.353,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so this goes off like",,,,

00:51:21.010,00:51:26.697,00:00:05.687,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"yeah like you have like robots in the room next to me",,,,
00:51:26.697,00:51:29.581,00:00:02.884,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"but in the next room you're teaching a kid how to do math",,,,

00:51:30.908,00:51:35.178,00:00:04.270,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh this is wrong",,,,
00:51:37.363,00:51:39.887,00:00:02.524,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I was starting to wonder what was going on there",,,
00:51:40.000,00:51:40.017,00:00:00.017,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah (inaudible) pause filler",,,,
00:51:40.017,00:51:43.000,00:00:02.983,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah (inaudible) pause filler","so the next five up there right",,,
00:51:43.000,00:51:46.063,00:00:03.063,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so the next five up there right",,,
00:51:47.410,00:51:48.049,00:00:00.639,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah",,,,
00:51:48.777,00:51:51.331,00:00:02.554,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so here's one thing I notice you're getting confused at",,,
00:51:51.331,00:51:53.636,00:00:02.305,,,,,,,,,,,,,"what you want to do is that",,,
00:51:53.636,00:51:55.622,00:00:01.986,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you're doing the five",,,
00:51:57.238,00:51:59.104,00:00:01.866,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you want to do this but",,,
00:51:59.104,00:52:04.042,00:00:04.938,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and it's hard because for you",,,
00:52:04.042,00:52:05.300,00:00:01.258,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you're not finding any numbers",,,
00:52:05.679,00:52:07.445,00:00:01.766,,,,,,,,,,,,,"but if you were actually to do this that",,,
00:52:07.445,00:52:08.782,00:00:01.337,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so it must be x isn't it",,,
00:52:09.650,00:52:10.637,00:00:00.987,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know why I put it",,,
00:52:10.637,00:52:11.236,00:00:00.599,,,,,,,,,,,,"that's anx",,,,
00:52:12.443,00:52:18.090,00:00:05.647,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so if you were to actually put the problem like this",,,
00:52:18.090,00:52:22.041,00:00:03.951,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you would still put a five over what five over x",,,
00:52:22.181,00:52:23.648,00:00:01.467,,,,,,,,,,,,,"then the x would care about",,,
00:52:23.648,00:52:27.838,00:00:04.190,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so it would just be one hundred thirty-seven x equals five",,,
00:52:27.838,00:52:31.819,00:00:03.981,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then it be a lot simpler for you to simplify it",,,
00:52:31.989,00:52:36.588,00:00:04.599,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so with that I think if you were to start pause filler the space the problems like that",,,
00:52:36.588,00:52:38.484,00:00:01.896,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you'll be able to get passed them pretty fast",,,
00:52:38.484,00:52:48.212,00:00:09.728,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so pause filler it just be times x right",,,,
00:52:49.519,00:52:51.814,00:00:02.295,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so one over x",,,
00:52:51.814,00:52:53.041,00:00:01.227,,,,,,,,,,,,,"or x times x",,,
00:52:53.360,00:52:55.984,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it doesn't matter whichever way of those you put it",,,
00:52:59.716,00:53:00.155,00:00:00.439,,,,,,,,,,,,"right",,,,
00:53:00.704,00:53:03.467,00:00:02.763,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so that's also correct",,,
00:53:03.936,00:53:10.501,00:00:06.565,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and your outcome is for this part here",,,
00:53:11.868,00:53:16.877,00:00:05.009,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so it's one thirty-seven x equals five yeah",,,
00:53:16.877,00:53:23.891,00:00:07.014,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right pause filler",,,,
00:53:24.390,00:53:36.692,00:00:12.302,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"one hundred and thirty-seven pause filler equals oh god my brain is like melting now",,,,
00:53:37.231,00:53:40.753,00:00:03.522,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,,"yeah okay I can just see how tired you are",,,
00:53:41.830,00:53:41.970,00:00:00.140,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh",,,,
00:53:41.970,00:53:55.479,00:00:13.509,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right and then five",,,,
00:53:55.479,00:54:00.208,00:00:04.729,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah (laughter)",,,,
00:54:00.208,00:54:02.413,00:00:02.205,,,,,,,,,,,,,"also you might forgot a little something there",,,
00:54:03.341,00:54:03.860,00:00:00.519,,,,,,,,,,,,"what",,,,
00:54:04.738,00:54:06.324,00:00:01.586,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah there's an x there",,,,
00:54:06.324,00:54:07.282,00:00:00.958,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah yeah",,,,
00:54:08.100,00:54:08.180,00:00:00.080,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,,
00:54:08.450,00:54:09.587,00:00:01.137,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so yeah",,,
00:54:09.587,00:54:12.211,00:00:02.624,,,,,,,,,,,,,"then once you get all this you just got to simplify it",,,
00:54:12.211,00:54:14.815,00:00:02.604,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then the whole thing becomes very very easy",,,

00:54:56.760,00:54:59.743,00:00:02.983,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then onto problem six",,,
00:55:00.432,00:55:00.771,00:00:00.339,,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay woah",,,
00:55:01.010,00:55:02.000,00:00:00.990,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yup okay so I'm going to also help you out here",,,

00:55:12.664,00:55:18.830,00:00:06.166,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right you were going to just rid of the thirty-nine by adding thirty-nine",,,
00:55:20.416,00:55:24.946,00:00:04.530,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and also you're going to add it oh wow you're already ahead of me",,,
00:55:25.604,00:55:29.515,00:00:03.911,,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you get that outcome there and also going",,,
00:55:35.103,00:55:35.861,00:00:00.758,,,,,,,,,,,,"nothing",,,,
00:55:36.968,00:55:41.847,00:00:04.879,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so then here you will have to subtract",,,
00:55:43.174,00:55:44.232,00:00:01.058,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah subtract",,,
00:55:46.666,00:55:48.612,00:00:01.946,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and so that's okay you subtract",,,
00:55:49.091,00:55:53.182,00:00:04.091,,,,,,,,,,,,,"whereas I'm totally getting I'm confusing myself looking at two things at once",,,
00:55:53.182,00:55:53.730,00:00:00.548,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right",,,,
00:55:54.588,00:55:56.903,00:00:02.315,,,,,,,,,,,,,"you will subtract twelve x from each side",,,
00:55:57.292,00:56:02.351,00:00:05.059,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh okay I get what we're doing here now",,,,
00:56:03.089,00:56:03.718,00:00:00.629,,,,,,,,,,,,"so yeah",,,,
00:56:04.007,00:56:06.461,00:00:02.454,,,,,,,,,,,,,"this just got a step higher from what were at before",,,
00:56:08.108,00:56:09.245,00:00:01.137,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah just a step",,,,
00:56:10.911,00:56:12.238,00:00:01.327,,,,,,,,,,,,"I see what we're doing",,,,
00:56:12.238,00:56:16.199,00:00:03.961,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that would be five x equals eighteen",,,,
00:56:17.995,00:56:19.442,00:00:01.447,,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so",,,
00:56:19.522,00:56:21.707,00:00:02.185,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you would do this right",,,,
00:56:22.844,00:56:24.041,00:00:01.197,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah you would do that",,,
00:56:27.000,00:56:27.653,00:00:00.653,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay pause filler",,,,
