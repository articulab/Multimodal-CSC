00:20:03.200,00:20:05.000,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"or should we just keep the fraction",
00:20:05.400,00:20:08.200,00:00:02.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"or do we have to divide it",

00:22:59.900,00:23:02.900,00:00:03.000,,,,,,,,,,,"yes but that's not all the answers though",,
00:23:03.000,00:23:03.900,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"well I know that",
00:23:03.900,00:23:05.000,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"I know that's not the answer",
00:23:05.100,00:23:07.200,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"but then do we do three over negative pause filler",
00:23:07.279,00:23:07.300,00:00:00.021,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:23:07.300,00:23:10.400,00:00:03.100,"TRC",,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"oh I know the I don't know the answer",,
00:23:10.400,00:23:10.418,00:00:00.018,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,"but I know what to do next",,
00:23:10.418,00:23:13.000,00:00:02.582,,,,,,,,,,,"but I know what to do next",,
00:23:13.000,00:23:17.400,00:00:04.400,,,,,,,,,,,"okay do you want the next pause filler thing",,
00:23:18.700,00:23:21.800,00:00:03.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"should we just like finish this one though",
00:23:23.100,00:23:26.000,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,,"so did you add eighteen to both sides",,
00:23:27.100,00:23:28.200,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler yeah and",
00:23:28.200,00:23:30.200,00:00:02.000,,,,,,,,,,,"eighteen plus fifty-two",,
00:23:30.800,00:23:31.600,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"is seventy",
00:23:31.600,00:23:32.400,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I got that",
00:23:33.500,00:23:41.200,00:00:07.700,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so then you have to take the excuse me pause filler to the fraction",,
00:23:41.200,00:23:44.700,00:00:03.500,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you have to multiply it on both sides",,
00:23:46.500,00:23:48.400,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"again like we did the last one",
00:23:48.400,00:23:51.300,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,,"but you have to make it inproper so flip it",,
00:23:51.900,00:23:56.900,00:00:05.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay okay so negative three over two",
00:23:56.900,00:23:58.400,00:00:01.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that would cancel out right",
00:23:58.800,00:23:59.700,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,"wait hold up",,
00:24:00.200,00:24:04.000,00:00:03.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"if I did negative two over three time three negative three over two",
00:24:04.000,00:24:05.800,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"that would cancel out right",
00:24:05.800,00:24:06.900,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler",,
00:24:06.900,00:24:09.300,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"would it I think yeah",
00:24:09.300,00:24:10.500,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"because in the last one it did",
00:24:10.900,00:24:13.700,00:00:02.800,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and the one before that",,
00:24:14.400,00:24:24.900,00:00:10.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"mm-hmm okay I'm never going to just have to do seventy over three over two wait",
00:24:25.000,00:24:27.200,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"let me do the other one",
00:24:27.200,00:24:29.400,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"is it seventy over three over two or",
00:24:29.400,00:24:30.300,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,"wait hold up",,
00:24:30.500,00:24:35.400,00:00:04.900,,,,,,,,,,,"seventy times three",,
00:24:35.400,00:24:37.300,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"pause filler I mean two over three (inaudible)",
00:24:37.300,00:24:39.600,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,,"over two equals what",,
00:24:40.700,00:24:41.700,00:00:01.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay let's think",
00:24:41.900,00:24:43.200,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"two hundred ten",
00:24:43.500,00:24:49.600,00:00:06.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm just like wait no yeah wait no two thousand one hundred",
00:24:49.600,00:24:49.700,00:00:00.100,,,,,,,,,,,"no",,
00:24:49.700,00:24:58.200,00:00:08.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"like now because three time seven is twenty-one yeah two thousand one hundred what pause filler",
00:24:58.500,00:24:59.700,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,,"hold up let me see",,
00:24:59.700,00:25:01.000,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,"two ten",,
00:25:02.800,00:25:06.900,00:00:04.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"but that doesn't seem right",
00:25:08.400,00:25:09.400,00:00:01.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"like seventy times three",
00:25:09.400,00:25:12.400,00:00:03.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh yeah actually yeah okay",
00:25:12.400,00:25:16.700,00:00:04.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"let's just go with it and then okay so then",
00:25:16.700,00:25:20.100,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,,"and then we have to divide it",,
00:25:20.600,00:25:23.200,00:00:02.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"or can't we just keep it as a fraction",
00:25:24.300,00:25:25.400,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"we can't",
00:25:26.300,00:25:26.700,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"why",
00:25:26.700,00:25:28.900,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know",,
00:25:29.500,00:25:33.100,00:00:03.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"well okay divide it by two that is a hundred and five",
00:25:34.200,00:25:35.200,00:00:01.000,,,,,,,,,,,"no",,
00:25:36.500,00:25:37.300,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,,"find it's Gs",,
00:25:38.000,00:25:42.300,00:00:04.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"yup I'll just write a hundred and five",
00:25:42.300,00:25:49.900,00:00:07.600,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"pause filler that's a really bad zero a hundred",
00:25:50.200,00:25:54.600,00:00:04.400,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"that looks like a snail (inaudible) right there",
00:25:55.000,00:25:58.700,00:00:03.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"a hundred and five equals y all right",
00:25:58.900,00:26:00.000,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"should we do the next one",
00:26:00.900,00:26:02.200,00:00:01.300,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"there now it's a snail",,
00:26:03.900,00:26:04.000,00:00:00.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh (laughter)",
00:26:04.100,00:26:10.100,00:00:06.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay let's just do the next one",
00:26:11.400,00:26:16.600,00:00:05.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"okie doke now last one we added eighteen to each side",
00:26:16.600,00:26:20.100,00:00:03.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"now we're subtracting eighteen no thirteen right",
00:26:23.000,00:26:23.900,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,"no no no no",,
00:26:24.200,00:26:25.100,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,"well yes we are",,
00:26:25.200,00:26:28.100,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"because then you'll cancel out the thirteen on that side",
00:26:28.100,00:26:29.500,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then we'll just make the other one bigger",
00:26:29.500,00:26:32.500,00:00:03.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"so should we just subtract that",
00:26:33.400,00:26:40.100,00:00:06.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"so just yeah just subtract it I think",
00:26:40.100,00:26:40.200,00:00:00.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh",
00:26:40.200,00:26:44.900,00:00:04.700,,,,,,,,,,"cool so that's actually the time pause filler",,,
00:26:44.900,00:26:53.100,00:00:08.200,,,,,,,,,,"so pause filler oh it's just like last time we'll take a break",,,

00:35:12.500,00:35:17.100,00:00:04.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"times x well times x okay well",
00:35:17.100,00:35:23.700,00:00:06.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then well what do you think is going to happen",
00:35:25.000,00:35:25.200,00:00:00.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"done",
00:35:26.100,00:35:31.400,00:00:05.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you multiply x each side",
00:35:33.500,00:35:36.900,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,,"the x on the bottom of the fraction goes away",,
00:35:37.200,00:35:37.800,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so",
00:35:37.800,00:35:39.200,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,"and then it's just one",,
00:35:39.700,00:35:41.500,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah and then the other side",
00:35:41.500,00:35:44.700,00:00:03.200,,,,,,,,,,,"one times twenty-five which equals twenty-fivex",,
00:35:46.000,00:35:46.100,00:00:00.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"whoa",
00:35:46.100,00:35:49.500,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"now twenty-five times x",
00:35:49.500,00:35:50.400,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah twenty-fivex",,
00:35:52.100,00:35:52.400,00:00:00.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"wait",

00:35:58.700,00:36:00.600,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,"equals twenty-five x",,
00:36:05.000,00:36:06.100,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah but then",
00:36:06.100,00:36:19.100,00:00:13.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I think it's that",
00:36:20.100,00:36:28.200,00:00:08.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"no because you want to get x alone",
00:36:28.600,00:36:32.400,00:00:03.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"so maybe if you divide each side",
00:36:33.200,00:36:34.900,00:00:01.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay",
00:36:35.000,00:36:38.200,00:00:03.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"you have to divide each side by twenty-five because then",
00:36:38.300,00:36:43.100,00:00:04.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"x on this side is going to just is going to be",
00:36:43.100,00:36:44.900,00:00:01.800,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"hello it's",

00:36:49.700,00:36:50.300,00:00:00.600,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"how",,
00:36:54.200,00:36:55.000,00:00:00.800,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I just can",
00:36:56.500,00:36:59.000,00:00:02.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"but going on okay",
00:37:00.500,00:37:02.100,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"if we divide",
00:37:04.300,00:37:05.500,00:00:01.200,,,"SV",,"SV2B",,,,,,"you're like wow",,
00:37:05.800,00:37:10.100,00:00:04.300,,,"SV",,"SV2A",,,,,,"this is like you're skipping like all over like",,
00:37:10.100,00:37:11.500,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,"it's going very slow",,
00:37:11.800,00:37:13.200,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"like I'm moving like is it",
00:37:13.200,00:37:16.400,00:00:03.200,,,,,,,,,,,"you move and then it like stops",,
00:37:16.400,00:37:19.700,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah I don't know okay",
00:37:24.700,00:37:26.100,00:00:01.400,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"it's the sour stuff",
00:37:30.900,00:37:34.400,00:00:03.500,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"okay (laughter) in fact it's actually not that sour",
00:37:34.400,00:37:40.300,00:00:05.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"but okay so if we divide each side by twenty-five so because then what will happen to this side",
00:37:40.300,00:37:41.600,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"is it will just be x alone",
00:37:41.600,00:37:43.000,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"and that will be",
00:37:43.000,00:37:44.100,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"what will that be",
00:37:45.700,00:37:46.400,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,,"onex",,
00:37:46.900,00:37:48.000,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"one over twenty-five",
00:37:48.200,00:37:51.300,00:00:03.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"because if we're dividing this by twenty-five",
00:37:51.600,00:37:54.400,00:00:02.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"then it will be one divided by twenty-five which is that",
00:37:54.400,00:37:56.200,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then divide that by twenty-five",
00:37:56.400,00:37:58.700,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then it's just going to be x alone",
00:37:58.700,00:38:00.800,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"so whatever twenty-five equals x",
00:38:04.300,00:38:05.200,00:00:00.900,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I have two left",

00:38:22.000,00:38:23.900,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,"you have to add them to both sides",,
00:38:23.900,00:38:25.200,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,"seventeen to both sides",,
00:38:25.600,00:38:27.600,00:00:02.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay well do that",

00:38:41.600,00:38:48.100,00:00:06.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"no no you don't have to multiply",
00:38:48.200,00:38:59.500,00:00:11.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"you just have to add",
00:38:59.500,00:39:05.100,00:00:05.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"like yeah let me show you",
00:39:05.100,00:39:08.200,00:00:03.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you add seventeen to this side",
00:39:08.400,00:39:10.400,00:00:02.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"then that will cancel out right",
00:39:10.600,00:39:10.800,00:00:00.200,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:39:11.100,00:39:12.000,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you can just all right",
00:39:12.500,00:39:15.800,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then if you add seventeen to this side",
00:39:15.800,00:39:23.000,00:00:07.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"what's it get us",

00:41:01.400,00:41:03.100,00:00:01.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"so here write down negative three",
00:41:03.100,00:41:07.300,00:00:04.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"because if we so if we do negative y times negative three over y",
00:41:07.500,00:41:09.600,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"so just write negative three",
00:41:09.700,00:41:14.000,00:00:04.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then just write eighty times y",
00:41:14.500,00:41:15.800,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then that's our thing",

00:41:28.000,00:41:35.900,00:00:07.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"so right now it's negative three equals",
00:41:36.100,00:41:41.400,00:00:05.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"negative three equals eighty eighty x eighty y",
00:41:41.400,00:41:44.700,00:00:03.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then what we do is we divide",
00:41:45.100,00:41:47.500,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"if we want to get y alone what do we do",
00:41:49.900,00:41:52.800,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,,"you have to subtract or add",,
00:41:53.000,00:41:56.600,00:00:03.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"no you have to divide",
00:41:57.200,00:41:58.100,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,"what you said",,
00:41:58.700,00:41:59.100,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:41:59.400,00:42:05.200,00:00:05.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then what we're going to so we have negative three equals eighty pause filler y",
00:42:05.300,00:42:07.700,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then we're going to divide by eighty on each side",
00:42:08.200,00:42:14.100,00:00:05.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"and so it's going to be negative pause filler three over eighty",
00:42:14.200,00:42:16.100,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"because if we're dividing that",
00:42:16.100,00:42:19.500,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then since we divided the other side by eighty",
00:42:20.100,00:42:23.700,00:00:03.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's going to be pause filler it's just going to be y now",
00:42:24.600,00:42:26.700,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what's it all equal",
00:42:29.800,00:42:30.700,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,"you stumped me",,

00:42:35.700,00:42:38.300,00:00:02.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay let me explain everything we did okay",
00:42:39.300,00:42:41.700,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"just like I don't feel like writing the whole thing again",
00:42:41.700,00:42:43.600,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"but I'll just explain it so",
00:42:43.700,00:42:45.000,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,"wait hold on are we here",,
00:42:46.100,00:42:48.200,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"here do you want me to just go from the very beginning",
00:42:49.400,00:42:49.800,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,"no",,
00:42:50.500,00:42:55.300,00:00:04.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"where did you get lost",

00:42:58.300,00:42:59.500,00:00:01.200,,,"SV",,"SV2A",,,,,,"I can't",,
00:42:59.600,00:43:06.200,00:00:06.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so what we did first is we added eighteen to each side",
00:43:06.800,00:43:07.500,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"you know that right",
00:43:08.000,00:43:08.300,00:00:00.300,,,,,,,,,,,"uh-huh",,
00:43:10.000,00:43:13.700,00:00:03.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then on the left side we have negative three over y",
00:43:13.700,00:43:16.700,00:00:03.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then on the other side we had eighty",
00:43:16.700,00:43:21.100,00:00:04.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"because we added to the seventeen cancelled out yeah",
00:43:21.100,00:43:29.400,00:00:08.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then what we did is we divided each side by y yeah",
00:43:29.800,00:43:34.700,00:00:04.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then what happened is the negative three over y just became negative three",
00:43:34.700,00:43:38.200,00:00:03.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"and six and eighty became eighty times y",
00:43:38.800,00:43:42.700,00:00:03.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"so at this point it was negative three equals eighty times y",
00:43:43.400,00:43:49.000,00:00:05.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then what happened was we divided so we had pause filler",
00:43:49.000,00:43:50.500,00:00:01.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"let me just write this out",
00:43:51.000,00:43:52.400,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"so we had negative three",
00:43:52.400,00:44:00.200,00:00:07.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"since pause filler negative three equals eighty times y",
00:44:01.798,00:44:01.800,00:00:00.002,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:44:01.800,00:44:03.300,00:00:01.500,"TRC",,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"oh my gosh",
00:44:03.300,00:44:03.316,00:00:00.016,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,
00:44:04.000,00:44:04.800,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"eighty times y",
00:44:04.800,00:44:07.700,00:00:02.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"let's just pretend that says eighty times y okay",
00:44:08.200,00:44:13.100,00:00:04.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"because we got there because we had multiplied times y on each side",
00:44:13.100,00:44:15.700,00:00:02.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"and it became negative three equals eighty y",
00:44:15.800,00:44:16.700,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"you get that",
00:44:19.700,00:44:20.200,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"you get that",
00:44:20.800,00:44:21.500,00:00:00.700,,,,"SV",,"SV2A",,,,,,"you get that",
00:44:21.700,00:44:22.300,00:00:00.600,,,,"SV",,"SV2A",,,,,,"you get that",
00:44:22.300,00:44:23.200,00:00:00.900,,,,"SV",,"SV2A",,,,,,"you get that",
00:44:24.000,00:44:24.500,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,,"hold up",,
00:44:24.500,00:44:25.700,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,,"go back to eighty times y",,
00:44:25.700,00:44:26.900,00:00:01.200,,,,,,,,,,,"what does it equal",,
00:44:28.500,00:44:30.200,00:00:01.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"we don't do eighty times y",
00:44:30.600,00:44:32.400,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"what we do next is the fourth like",
00:44:32.800,00:44:34.400,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"we want to get y alone",
00:44:34.400,00:44:36.200,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"and right now y is with eighty",
00:44:36.200,00:44:37.500,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you have to divide",
00:44:37.700,00:44:43.500,00:00:05.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"if you do eighty if eighty times y if you do eighty times y divided by eight",
00:44:43.500,00:44:45.600,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"it just becomes y",
00:44:45.600,00:44:49.500,00:00:03.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"because the eighty divided eighty just cancels out and then becomes y",
00:44:49.700,00:44:50.800,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you get that",
00:44:51.300,00:44:51.800,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:44:52.400,00:44:56.600,00:00:04.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so it's just y on the right side",
00:44:56.600,00:45:01.500,00:00:04.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then we also have to do pause filler divide eighty on the other side",
00:45:01.500,00:45:03.300,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then it's just negative three divided by eighty",
00:45:03.300,00:45:05.100,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"so the final thing do you",
00:45:05.200,00:45:05.900,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"what is it",
00:45:08.500,00:45:10.200,00:00:01.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"negative three over eighty",
00:45:12.599,00:45:12.600,00:00:00.001,"TRC",,,,,,,,,,,,

00:45:18.300,00:45:21.000,00:00:02.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's negative three over eighty equals y",

00:45:40.800,00:45:44.000,00:00:03.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"how do you like get that away (laughter)",
00:45:44.700,00:45:48.100,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay do you know what to do now",
00:45:48.700,00:45:52.400,00:00:03.700,,,,,,,,,,,"we have to subtract forty fifty-four sorry pause filler (laughter)",,

00:45:59.900,00:46:09.000,00:00:09.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah so write that down subtract fifty-four from each side",
00:46:09.900,00:46:20.200,00:00:10.300,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I just moved my little box where like I am",

00:46:29.400,00:46:33.800,00:00:04.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you just subtract fifty-four from each side",
00:46:33.800,00:46:39.400,00:00:05.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"because then you'll get rid of the fifty-four on the one side",
00:46:41.100,00:46:54.500,00:00:13.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so then it's just yeah four over k equals",
00:46:54.800,00:46:59.300,00:00:04.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then what is one hundred sixteen minus fifty-four",

00:47:31.200,00:47:31.800,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,,"the what",,
00:47:32.500,00:47:32.900,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"the four",

00:47:36.500,00:47:38.300,00:00:01.800,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so you have to divide",,

00:47:44.100,00:47:47.600,00:00:03.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"so you have to do yeah so multiply k by each side",
00:47:47.600,00:47:49.895,00:00:02.295,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then on the left side",

00:48:07.700,00:48:13.700,00:00:06.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"so if we multiply k to each side we'll get four all alone",
00:48:13.700,00:48:15.400,00:00:01.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then you'll have sixty-two k",
00:48:15.600,00:48:21.600,00:00:06.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"so can you write that down",
00:48:24.600,00:48:25.400,00:00:00.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"equals four",

00:48:48.000,00:49:00.600,00:00:12.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"but what do you think we have to divide it by",
00:49:00.800,00:49:02.200,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"guess what we have to divide it by",
00:49:03.500,00:49:03.900,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,"four",,
00:49:04.100,00:49:06.000,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"you can just write it as a fraction",

00:49:10.200,00:49:20.000,00:00:09.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then at the end it all just equals k equals four divided by sixty-two",
00:49:20.200,00:49:20.500,00:00:00.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",

00:50:07.700,00:50:11.100,00:00:03.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right so then fifteen point five equals k",

00:50:27.400,00:50:30.800,00:00:03.400,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"let me figure out what we have to do for this just so I can pause filler",
00:50:32.000,00:50:32.300,00:00:00.300,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"okay",
00:50:34.900,00:50:35.900,00:00:01.000,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah okay",
00:50:35.900,00:50:38.800,00:00:02.900,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"I think I know (laughter)",
00:50:39.100,00:50:41.900,00:00:02.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"how do I get",
00:50:43.100,00:50:45.700,00:00:02.600,,,,,,,,,,,"well I think you have to subtract it",,
00:50:48.000,00:50:48.900,00:00:00.900,,,,,,,,,,,,"no no no (laughter)",
00:50:48.900,00:50:50.800,00:00:01.900,,,,,,,,,,,"well then it's multiply or addition",,
00:50:50.800,00:50:54.900,00:00:04.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah how do we get the negative fourteen all alone",
00:50:57.100,00:50:59.500,00:00:02.400,,,,,,,,,,,"you have to subtract it byy",,
00:50:59.500,00:51:00.769,00:00:01.269,,,,,,,,,,,,"multiply multiply",

00:51:07.300,00:51:10.000,00:00:02.700,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"oh that feels good to like take them off",
00:51:10.900,00:51:11.400,00:00:00.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay",
00:51:12.200,00:51:15.700,00:00:03.500,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"that's the people at school would be like put their heads (inaudible)",
00:51:16.100,00:51:21.800,00:00:05.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so if we did pause filler negative fourteen over y times y",
00:51:21.800,00:51:24.000,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"that's going to just equal negative fourteen",
00:51:24.000,00:51:25.300,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"do you want to write that down",
00:51:27.700,00:51:30.000,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"here I'll like write a little arrow",
00:51:33.900,00:51:35.600,00:00:01.700,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"why is this computer so slow",
00:51:35.600,00:51:49.200,00:00:13.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so then it's just going to be it's two hundred ten pause filler times y is going to equal negative fourteen",
00:51:52.000,00:51:55.700,00:00:03.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"do you get that",
00:51:56.400,00:51:56.700,00:00:00.300,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",,
00:51:58.300,00:52:03.900,00:00:05.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"okay so now that we have two hundred ten times y equals fourteen",
00:52:04.400,00:52:06.700,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"we just have to make y alone",
00:52:07.800,00:52:13.000,00:00:05.200,,,,,,,,,,,"so then we have to do y plus y or subtraction",,
00:52:13.400,00:52:14.000,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"division",
00:52:14.000,00:52:17.800,00:00:03.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"we have to divide two hundred ten y divided by two hundred ten",
00:52:17.800,00:52:20.100,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"because then it will leave y alone",
00:52:20.100,00:52:21.200,00:00:01.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"do you get that",
00:52:22.500,00:52:25.000,00:00:02.500,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"so oh my god you just disappeared",
00:52:26.400,00:52:27.200,00:00:00.800,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"oh there you are",
00:52:27.200,00:52:28.300,00:00:01.100,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"it like you like disappeared",
00:52:28.300,00:52:30.500,00:00:02.200,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"like the screen went like blue like",
00:52:30.500,00:52:30.700,00:00:00.200,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"not blue",
00:52:30.700,00:52:32.800,00:00:02.100,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"but like it was just like a home screen",
00:52:32.800,00:52:39.800,00:00:07.000,,,,"SV",,"SV1A",,,,,,"and it was just like I was like what did I do okay pause filler",
00:52:39.800,00:52:42.000,00:00:02.200,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what's it going to do",
00:52:42.300,00:52:47.400,00:00:05.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"it's two hundred ten y divided by two hundred ten",
00:52:48.500,00:52:49.900,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"so that's just going to be y",
00:52:49.900,00:52:53.600,00:00:03.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"and then what's going to happen to the negative fourteen",
00:52:55.900,00:52:57.200,00:00:01.300,,,,,,,,,,,"is that the answer",,
00:52:57.800,00:52:58.200,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah",
00:52:59.200,00:52:59.600,00:00:00.400,,,,,,,,,,,"okay (laughter)",,
00:53:00.100,00:53:02.600,00:00:02.500,,,,,,,,,,,,"so what's the full answer",
00:53:03.300,00:53:04.800,00:00:01.500,,,,,,,,,,,"y equals negative fourteen",,
00:53:05.500,00:53:06.200,00:00:00.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"over",
00:53:07.700,00:53:09.800,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,"y I have no idea",,
00:53:10.700,00:53:11.300,00:00:00.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"two hundred ten",
00:53:12.100,00:53:20.900,00:00:08.800,,,,,,,,,,,,"because if we have to divide two hundred ten y pause filler by two hundred ten you also have to do that to the other side",
00:53:20.900,00:53:22.500,00:00:01.600,,,,,,,,,,,,"because since we're trying to get y alone",
00:53:22.800,00:53:26.500,00:00:03.700,,,,,,,,,,,,"so we had to divide two hundred ten to each side",
00:53:26.800,00:53:28.900,00:00:02.100,,,,,,,,,,,,"so then the other side just became y",
00:53:28.900,00:53:34.200,00:00:05.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"and the other side is now negative fourteen divided by two hundred ten",
00:53:36.900,00:53:38.300,00:00:01.400,,,,,,,,,,,,"you got it",
00:53:38.300,00:53:40.600,00:00:02.300,,,,,,,,,,,,"all right want to go to the next one",
