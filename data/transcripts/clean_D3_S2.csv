73,3,2,00:04:56.200,00:04:59.200,00:00:03.000,so I'm not figured out what we're going to do,
74,3,2,00:04:59.200,00:05:03.976,00:00:04.776,but yeah we're probably going to end up going to Maryland because my grandparents are over there,

77,3,2,00:05:06.191,00:05:09.833,00:00:03.642,but we're not sure we're going to go this year,
78,3,2,00:05:10.382,00:05:12.836,00:00:02.454,so we need to figure that out,
79,3,2,00:05:17.126,00:05:19.222,00:00:02.096,,so it was just warm
80,3,2,00:05:19.222,00:05:20.568,00:00:01.346,,and then it's not even warm again
81,3,2,00:05:20.568,00:05:21.636,00:00:01.068,,it's just cold again
82,3,2,00:05:21.895,00:05:22.953,00:00:01.058,I know it sucks,

84,3,2,00:05:24.240,00:05:26.196,00:00:01.956,I want it to be warm,
85,3,2,00:05:26.196,00:05:28.910,00:00:02.714,and it's like somewhat snowing outside,
86,3,2,00:05:29.029,00:05:30.546,00:00:01.517,,it was snowing yeah
87,3,2,00:05:30.765,00:05:31.224,00:00:00.459,yeah,

90,3,2,00:05:38.398,00:05:42.219,00:00:03.821,,yeah the only thing I really like about winter is when it actually snows
91,3,2,00:05:42.219,00:05:43.975,00:00:01.756,,and then it barely even snowed this winter
92,3,2,00:05:43.975,00:05:44.464,00:00:00.489,,so I'm done
93,3,2,00:05:44.464,00:05:48.984,00:00:04.520,I know it was just sort of like annoying like enough that you had to shovel it,
94,3,2,00:05:49.084,00:05:51.359,00:00:02.275,but you didn't get any days off,

101,3,2,00:06:06.245,00:06:10.585,00:00:04.340,it is like winter wasn't even here,
102,3,2,00:06:11.163,00:06:11.543,00:00:00.380,,yeah (laughter)
103,3,2,00:06:14.835,00:06:17.320,00:00:02.485,,I don't know if they go to your school or not
104,3,2,00:06:17.320,00:06:20.931,00:00:03.611,,but a couple of my friends are at Squirrel Hill and then pause filler
105,3,2,00:06:21.001,00:06:22.777,00:00:01.776,,do you know Sophia Doyna or Trisha Soreta
106,3,2,00:06:23.666,00:06:24.566,00:00:00.900,I don't think so,
107,3,2,00:06:24.544,00:06:28.275,00:00:03.731,,okay because I think they go to Falk
108,3,2,00:06:28.275,00:06:30.090,00:00:01.815,,never mind (laughter)
109,3,2,00:06:31.118,00:06:31.667,00:00:00.549,yeah,
110,3,2,00:06:47.560,00:06:50.175,00:00:02.615,,so what made you decide to do the CMU thing
111,3,2,00:06:50.674,00:06:55.054,00:00:04.380,oh well I guess pause filler my mom works here,
112,3,2,00:06:55.054,00:06:56.301,00:00:01.247,so she noticed it,
113,3,2,00:06:56.381,00:06:59.933,00:00:03.552,and yeah I decided I'd do it,
114,3,2,00:07:00.082,00:07:00.312,00:00:00.230,,yeah
115,3,2,00:07:00.621,00:07:00.970,00:00:00.349,so,
116,3,2,00:07:01.349,00:07:04.891,00:00:03.542,,it's not too long you get money
117,3,2,00:07:05.470,00:07:06.717,00:00:01.247,yeah money is nice,
118,3,2,00:07:06.987,00:07:09.222,00:00:02.235,,yeah but it's a good experience also
119,3,2,00:07:10.259,00:07:10.668,00:00:00.409,yeah (inaudible),
120,3,2,00:07:18.351,00:07:19.528,00:00:01.177,,thank you
121,3,2,00:07:19.528,00:07:20.855,00:00:01.327,I have a question,
122,3,2,00:07:20.915,00:07:26.283,00:00:05.368,is there a way to turn this down a little bit,
123,3,2,00:07:26.283,00:07:27.221,00:00:00.938,,all right
124,3,2,00:07:27.221,00:07:28.328,00:00:01.107,(inaudible) all right thanks,
125,3,2,00:08:10.612,00:08:11.151,00:00:00.539,pause filler okay (laughter),
126,3,2,00:08:11.859,00:08:14.593,00:00:02.734,,so do you know how to do this
127,3,2,00:08:14.593,00:08:15.990,00:00:01.397,,you've learned this in school right
128,3,2,00:08:16.189,00:08:20.769,00:00:04.580,yeah so okay so yeah,
129,3,2,00:08:20.769,00:08:23.912,00:00:03.143,the first thing is you want to get x alone,
130,3,2,00:08:23.912,00:08:27.055,00:00:03.143,you want to get rid of those the three over seven pause filler,
131,3,2,00:08:28.262,00:08:37.351,00:00:09.089,,yes so then you would have to well on the sheet it was like saying that you would have to do seven x
132,3,2,00:08:37.351,00:08:38.908,00:00:01.557,,but I guess that's not
133,3,2,00:08:39.496,00:08:40.265,00:00:00.769,,well never mind
134,3,2,00:08:41.103,00:08:43.896,00:00:02.793,yeah so there's like two ways to do this,
135,3,2,00:08:43.956,00:08:47.458,00:00:03.502,you could either divide x plus three over seven,
136,3,2,00:08:47.458,00:08:50.352,00:00:02.894,or you could multiply it plus three over seven,
137,3,2,00:08:51.579,00:08:54.333,00:00:02.754,,yes so you would have to divide it by three sevens
138,3,2,00:08:55.151,00:08:58.543,00:00:03.392,yeah or we could multiply it by the reciprocal,
139,3,2,00:08:59.062,00:09:00.159,00:00:01.097,because that would also work,
140,3,2,00:09:00.159,00:09:01.846,00:00:01.687,because that would turn it into one,
141,3,2,00:09:02.534,00:09:03.322,00:00:00.788,,yeah yeah yeah
142,3,2,00:09:04.041,00:09:05.398,00:00:01.357,,so what do you think
143,3,2,00:09:05.398,00:09:06.126,00:00:00.728,,what do you
144,3,2,00:09:07.054,00:09:10.925,00:00:03.871,pause filler I mean it all depends,
145,3,2,00:09:11.035,00:09:13.759,00:00:02.724,would you rather divide forty or,
146,3,2,00:09:13.759,00:09:15.604,00:00:01.845,would you rather multiply over forty,
147,3,2,00:09:15.604,00:09:19.755,00:00:04.151,probably multiplying might be easier than dividing forty,
148,3,2,00:09:19.934,00:09:22.828,00:00:02.894,,all right then teach me how to do that then
149,3,2,00:09:27.280,00:09:29.463,00:00:02.183,okay okay that's weird oh okay yeah,
150,3,2,00:09:29.463,00:09:32.017,00:00:02.554,so you would want to do is,
151,3,2,00:09:32.017,00:09:36.696,00:00:04.679,you would want to just put like forty over here,
152,3,2,00:09:40.223,00:09:40.907,00:00:00.684,so that works,
153,3,2,00:09:40.907,00:09:45.935,00:00:05.028,so you I guess you would want to write out forty if you're going to multiply that,
154,3,2,00:09:50.795,00:09:51.543,00:00:00.748,,all right so then
155,3,2,00:09:51.543,00:09:59.993,00:00:08.450,so then pause filler if we're going to multiply it pause filler you're going to just write over here three over seven,
156,3,2,00:09:59.993,00:10:02.009,00:00:02.016,or seven over three yeah,
157,3,2,00:10:02.009,00:10:03.406,00:00:01.397,and you want to do a reciprocal,
158,3,2,00:10:02.288,00:10:03.855,00:00:01.567,,yeah
159,3,2,00:10:05.651,00:10:08.225,00:00:02.574,and I assume you know how to multiply fractions right,
160,3,2,00:10:08.783,00:10:11.896,00:00:03.113,,I actually haven't learned this for like a year or two
161,3,2,00:10:11.896,00:10:14.620,00:00:02.724,,so just refresh me on it
162,3,2,00:10:14.623,00:10:14.983,00:00:00.360,ok,
163,3,2,00:10:14.670,00:10:16.603,00:00:01.933,,I kind of remember but
164,3,2,00:10:17.392,00:10:21.495,00:00:04.103,so pause filler basically it's like multiplying normally except,
165,3,2,00:10:21.574,00:10:27.621,00:00:06.047,you want to multiply the forty times seven and the one times three,
166,3,2,00:10:28.149,00:10:30.384,00:00:02.235,,okay okay yeah yeah
167,3,2,00:10:29.333,00:10:29.723,00:00:00.390,so,
168,3,2,00:10:30.384,00:10:32.639,00:00:02.255,you just multiply straight across so you get,
169,3,2,00:10:33.248,00:10:34.166,00:00:00.918,,two hundred eighty
170,3,2,00:10:34.804,00:10:35.223,00:00:00.419,yeah,
171,3,2,00:10:38.725,00:10:42.277,00:00:03.552,,over three right
172,3,2,00:10:42.277,00:10:45.729,00:00:03.452,,and then does that pause filler does that simplify
173,3,2,00:10:42.298,00:10:42.638,00:00:00.340,yeah,
174,3,2,00:10:46.737,00:10:48.116,00:00:01.379,pause filler no,
175,3,2,00:10:49.696,00:10:50.696,00:00:01.000,,all right
176,3,2,00:10:57.110,00:10:59.190,00:00:02.080,I guess you could just say that,
177,3,2,00:10:59.204,00:11:00.820,00:00:01.616,because it would be okay,
178,3,2,00:11:00.724,00:11:01.024,00:00:00.300,,yeah
179,3,2,00:11:00.820,00:11:04.039,00:00:03.219,because you know you probably know (inaudible) okay,
180,3,2,00:11:05.941,00:11:06.311,00:00:00.370,ah,
181,3,2,00:11:06.333,00:11:07.570,00:00:01.237,,all right next up
182,3,2,00:11:07.570,00:11:11.940,00:00:04.370,,so now do you want to multiply from the reciprocal again
183,3,2,00:11:12.080,00:11:13.147,00:00:01.067,,so fourteen
184,3,2,00:11:13.496,00:11:13.885,00:00:00.389,yeah,
185,3,2,00:11:15.592,00:11:20.201,00:00:04.609,,time eight over three
186,3,2,00:11:21.778,00:11:24.910,00:00:03.132,,and then that's over one so fourteen times eight
187,3,2,00:11:26.188,00:11:27.894,00:00:01.706,,oh gosh what is fourteen times eight
188,3,2,00:11:28.283,00:11:30.927,00:00:02.644,see pause filler seven time eight is fifty-six,
189,3,2,00:11:30.927,00:11:33.890,00:00:02.963,fifty-six times two a hundred and twelve,
190,3,2,00:11:34.429,00:11:36.205,00:00:01.776,,all right thank you
191,3,2,00:11:36.893,00:11:38.949,00:00:02.056,,over three
192,3,2,00:11:39.607,00:11:39.966,00:00:00.359,yeah,
193,3,2,00:11:40.484,00:11:42.261,00:00:01.777,,all right so next up
194,3,2,00:11:44.326,00:11:45.683,00:00:01.357,,okay so
195,3,2,00:11:47.918,00:11:53.625,00:00:05.707,okay yeah for this one this one you just have you're adding an extra step to it,
196,3,2,00:11:53.625,00:11:57.137,00:00:03.512,so the first thing want to do is make sure y is alone on this,
197,3,2,00:11:58.354,00:12:05.857,00:00:07.503,,all right so you're adding eighteen to both sides
198,3,2,00:12:06.775,00:12:10.355,00:00:03.580,,so that will equal seventy right
199,3,2,00:12:11.554,00:12:11.784,00:00:00.230,pause filler yeah,
200,3,2,00:12:13.500,00:12:22.766,00:00:09.266,,so seventy negative two thirds y sorry my writing is so messy equals seventy
201,3,2,00:12:27.229,00:12:38.124,00:00:10.895,,so you want to do seventy times wait three
202,3,2,00:12:38.184,00:12:39.770,00:00:01.586,yeah you wanted to make sure there's a three,
203,3,2,00:12:39.770,00:12:41.452,00:00:01.682,,yeah wait let me go back
204,3,2,00:12:50.590,00:12:51.090,00:00:00.500,okay,
205,3,2,00:12:52.422,00:12:55.375,00:00:02.953,and you want to just multiply,
206,3,2,00:13:05.000,00:13:05.881,00:00:00.881,,seven times two equals (inaudible)
207,3,2,00:13:11.863,00:13:15.729,00:00:03.866,,and then that would equal to one hundred five
208,3,2,00:13:15.988,00:13:18.901,00:00:02.913,yeah maybe you could probably just put a y equals,
209,3,2,00:13:19.550,00:13:26.384,00:00:06.834,,yeah so finally it's our y equals one hundred
210,3,2,00:13:26.614,00:13:29.028,00:00:02.414,except one thing you forgot to do is,
211,3,2,00:13:29.028,00:13:33.708,00:00:04.680,I'm pretty sure the one o five would be a negative because yeah,
212,3,2,00:13:31.696,00:13:32.216,00:00:00.520,,oh yeah
213,3,2,00:13:34.326,00:13:36.910,00:00:02.584,you know y was a negative so,
214,3,2,00:13:40.000,00:13:41.809,00:00:01.809,,all right next up
215,3,2,00:13:45.045,00:13:48.324,00:00:03.279,,all right so same thing here
216,3,2,00:13:48.903,00:13:49.262,00:00:00.359,yeah,
217,3,2,00:13:53.380,00:13:55.987,00:00:02.607,,so you would want to do minus thirteen on both sides
218,3,2,00:13:56.705,00:14:02.379,00:00:05.674,,and that would equal one x equals thirty-one
219,3,2,00:14:09.456,00:14:17.249,00:00:07.793,,then thirty-one over three times two over one equals sixty-two
220,3,2,00:14:17.608,00:14:17.897,00:00:00.289,yep,
221,3,2,00:14:20.930,00:14:26.308,00:00:05.378,,so would it be x equals sixty-two then
222,3,2,00:14:26.308,00:14:27.555,00:00:01.247,yeah as you said,
223,3,2,00:14:28.144,00:14:32.524,00:00:04.380,because you can't really do you could divide it by one but that would still be a sixty-two,
224,3,2,00:14:32.539,00:14:32.929,00:00:00.390,,yeah
225,3,2,00:14:37.724,00:14:41.344,00:00:03.620,,yeah okay so this is a little bit different because it's like on the other side
226,3,2,00:14:41.344,00:14:43.479,00:00:02.135,,but it's still the same so
227,3,2,00:14:43.689,00:14:44.178,00:00:00.489,yeah,
228,3,2,00:14:44.178,00:14:47.000,00:00:02.822,,add sixteen to both sides
229,3,2,00:14:51.440,00:14:54.530,00:00:03.090,,so then you I'm just going to flip this around so three 
230,3,2,00:14:56.180,00:15:01.957,00:00:05.777,,actually I'm just going to go six over three equals
231,3,2,00:15:05.757,00:15:07.285,00:00:01.528,,my gosh it's not even showing up
232,3,2,00:15:08.193,00:15:08.881,00:00:00.688,it's not,
233,3,2,00:15:09.400,00:15:10.308,00:00:00.908,,wait one second
234,3,2,00:15:11.166,00:15:12.872,00:00:01.706,,this tip like lagging
235,3,2,00:15:13.800,00:15:14.249,00:00:00.449,okay,
236,3,2,00:15:16.315,00:15:20.315,00:00:04.000,,forty-seven over pause filler
237,3,2,00:15:21.642,00:15:24.875,00:00:03.233,,so then oh gosh what's six times forty-seven
238,3,2,00:15:24.875,00:15:27.599,00:00:02.724,pause filler well one thing you could do let's see wait (inaudible),
239,3,2,00:15:27.599,00:15:37.965,00:00:10.366,I guess before you do that you maybe you could simplify pause filler the sixty over three to like two,
240,3,2,00:15:38.534,00:15:39.412,00:00:00.878,that might help you,
241,3,2,00:15:39.442,00:15:50.956,00:00:11.514,,oh yeah so three over one so forty-seven time two equals pause filler fifty-four right
242,3,2,00:15:52.422,00:16:02.559,00:00:10.137,well not times two forty-seven would be eighty but mostly fourteen ninety-four because it wouldn't,
243,3,2,00:16:02.559,00:16:09.324,00:00:06.765,,yeah so ninety-four and then pause filler
244,3,2,00:16:09.324,00:16:13.505,00:00:04.181,,that would be over that would just be ninety-four
245,3,2,00:16:13.330,00:16:13.910,00:00:00.580,yeah,
246,3,2,00:16:13.505,00:16:15.620,00:00:02.115,,so x equals ninety-four
247,3,2,00:16:20.379,00:16:22.275,00:00:01.896,,I haven't done the reciprocal for a long time
248,3,2,00:16:22.275,00:16:23.527,00:00:01.252,,so that's why I'm just
249,3,2,00:16:24.488,00:16:25.268,00:00:00.780,it is fun,
250,3,2,00:16:27.533,00:16:29.249,00:00:01.716,,so big numbers now
251,3,2,00:16:29.339,00:16:30.496,00:00:01.157,,minus
252,3,2,00:16:29.993,00:16:30.483,00:00:00.490,yeah,
253,3,2,00:16:33.429,00:16:34.607,00:00:01.178,,forty-eight so
254,3,2,00:16:43.707,00:16:45.003,00:00:01.296,yeah so you want to subtract,
255,3,2,00:16:47.093,00:16:48.754,00:00:01.661,,would that be forty-nine
256,3,2,00:16:49.173,00:16:49.642,00:00:00.469,yeah,
257,3,2,00:16:50.356,00:16:50.756,00:00:00.400,,all right
258,3,2,00:16:58.491,00:17:02.942,00:00:04.451,,all right so so that would be five over twelve there
259,3,2,00:17:02.942,00:17:03.860,00:00:00.918,yeah,
260,3,2,00:17:04.229,00:17:05.530,00:00:01.301,,here I'm just going to
261,3,2,00:17:15.494,00:17:16.082,00:00:00.588,yeah okay,
262,3,2,00:17:16.082,00:17:18.507,00:00:02.425,and that would be a y right (inaudible),
263,3,2,00:17:22.000,00:17:24.513,00:00:02.513,,all right so forty-nine times five
264,3,2,00:17:25.353,00:17:27.067,00:00:01.714,,I wish there was a calculator gosh
265,3,2,00:17:27.167,00:17:27.786,00:00:00.619,I know,
266,3,2,00:17:32.000,00:17:39.579,00:00:07.579,,so nine times five equals pause filler forty-five sorry forty-five
267,3,2,00:17:40.946,00:17:41.415,00:00:00.469,forty-five,
268,3,2,00:17:41.415,00:17:44.617,00:00:03.202,and that equals to a hundred well,
269,3,2,00:17:46.354,00:17:48.249,00:00:01.895,,one hundred sixty-five
270,3,2,00:17:49.297,00:17:50.833,00:00:01.536,no wait that wait,
271,3,2,00:17:51.023,00:17:52.909,00:00:01.886,forty-five does a hundred and forty-five,
272,3,2,00:17:53.048,00:17:58.376,00:00:05.328,because forty times five equals two hundred so,
273,3,2,00:18:01.758,00:18:03.748,00:00:01.990,,are you sure it's not a hundred sixty-five
274,3,2,00:18:05.450,00:18:06.987,00:00:01.537,wait maybe,
275,3,2,00:18:06.987,00:18:10.120,00:00:03.133,oh wait yeah it's forty-nine,
276,3,2,00:18:10.479,00:18:15.208,00:00:04.729,yeah forty-nine times five equals five okay,
277,3,2,00:18:16.545,00:18:20.346,00:00:03.801,that's like okay so that's your five right pause filler,
278,3,2,00:18:21.164,00:18:22.681,00:00:01.517,so you have four over pause filler,
279,3,2,00:18:24.088,00:18:30.239,00:00:06.151,then as you go like that because you have to have zero there,
280,3,2,00:18:30.891,00:18:32.741,00:00:01.850,so it would be two hundred forty-five and pause filler five (inaudible),
281,3,2,00:18:32.747,00:18:33.357,00:00:00.610,,yeah
282,3,2,00:18:41.867,00:18:44.102,00:00:02.235,,all right next page
283,3,2,00:18:44.531,00:18:46.008,00:00:01.477,,oh gosh all right
284,3,2,00:18:46.098,00:18:52.334,00:00:06.236,,so this one is going to be plus sixty-one to both sides
285,3,2,00:18:52.543,00:18:52.703,00:00:00.160,yup,
286,3,2,00:18:52.703,00:18:59.018,00:00:06.315,,and then you also want to add the two ys y thing right
287,3,2,00:18:59.168,00:19:00.425,00:00:01.257,,because that's like (inaudible)
288,3,2,00:19:00.425,00:19:01.323,00:00:00.898,yeah so yeah,
289,3,2,00:19:01.323,00:19:04.511,00:00:03.188,because there is two ones I really want one,
290,3,2,00:19:06.511,00:19:08.016,00:00:01.505,,what just happened
291,3,2,00:19:09.016,00:19:09.534,00:00:00.518,wait a minute,
292,3,2,00:19:09.534,00:19:18.255,00:00:08.721,so would you really want to so wait which side would you want to have your y on before you do this,
293,3,2,00:19:15.488,00:19:16.069,00:00:00.581,,em
294,3,2,00:19:20.090,00:19:22.455,00:00:02.365,,pause filler I guess this side
295,3,2,00:19:22.455,00:19:24.091,00:00:01.636,,like this side over here
296,3,2,00:19:25.329,00:19:28.252,00:00:02.923,oh so for that you'd have to subtract the y pause filler,
297,3,2,00:19:28.761,00:19:33.600,00:00:04.839,no so that would be harder than adding the y over here,
298,3,2,00:19:33.600,00:19:38.339,00:00:04.739,because I guess if you add it over here then you would get pause filler,
299,3,2,00:19:38.339,00:19:38.519,00:00:00.180,oh wait (inaudible),
300,3,2,00:19:38.668,00:19:39.327,00:00:00.659,huh huh,
301,3,2,00:19:47.100,00:19:48.197,00:00:01.097,I guess it doesn't make a difference,
302,3,2,00:19:48.197,00:19:53.714,00:00:05.517,but the y would be you'd have the negative y if you do it this way,
303,3,2,00:19:53.714,00:19:56.558,00:00:02.844,or you have a positive y if you did it that way,
304,3,2,00:19:57.286,00:19:59.690,00:00:02.404,so that yeah it doesn't matter that much,
305,3,2,00:19:59.910,00:20:01.017,00:00:01.107,so I guess yeah,
306,3,2,00:20:01.975,00:20:05.000,00:00:03.025,,just work through the first step really quick because I'm confused just
307,3,2,00:20:05.557,00:20:06.226,00:00:00.669,,I'm sorry
308,3,2,00:20:07.014,00:20:09.079,00:00:02.065,yeah pause filler,
309,3,2,00:20:09.209,00:20:16.193,00:00:06.984,yeah not subtracting sixty-one I mean this one is like a smaller one so I mean,
310,3,2,00:20:18.193,00:20:21.451,00:00:03.258,usually we'll do the one that was smaller but it doesn't matter exactly,
311,3,2,00:20:24.404,00:20:25.861,00:00:01.457,,well this one is smaller right
312,3,2,00:20:25.901,00:20:26.709,00:00:00.808,,oh yeah so
313,3,2,00:20:27.509,00:20:32.386,00:00:04.877,I mean when I add the sixty-five just sixty-one yeah,
314,3,2,00:20:34.192,00:20:36.048,00:00:01.856,,all right so twenty-five
315,3,2,00:20:41.046,00:20:41.865,00:00:00.819,eight-six,
316,3,2,00:20:41.954,00:20:42.274,00:00:00.320,,yeah
317,3,2,00:20:56.671,00:20:57.310,00:00:00.639,okay,
318,3,2,00:20:57.679,00:20:59.205,00:00:01.526,,oh wait no that's equals
319,3,2,00:20:59.554,00:21:00.762,00:00:01.208,,oh my gosh
320,3,2,00:21:01.360,00:21:01.969,00:00:00.609,,I'll just
321,3,2,00:21:21.106,00:21:23.480,00:00:02.374,,so then you would sub you would oh so how do you add this then
322,3,2,00:21:23.480,00:21:24.228,00:00:00.748,,because it's like
323,3,2,00:21:24.997,00:21:25.476,00:00:00.479,oh wait,
324,3,2,00:21:25.476,00:21:30.105,00:00:04.629,so you want to get rid of the wait so now you want to subtract the y right,
325,3,2,00:21:30.105,00:21:32.001,00:00:01.896,because you only have y on one side,
326,3,2,00:21:32.549,00:21:34.874,00:00:02.325,and so if you got rid of that y,
327,3,2,00:21:34.874,00:21:37.167,00:00:02.293,then you would have like a zero so,
328,3,2,00:21:38.925,00:21:45.929,00:00:07.004,,so would that be negative six over six y then
329,3,2,00:21:52.657,00:21:52.847,00:00:00.190,wait,
330,3,2,00:21:52.660,00:21:55.078,00:00:02.418,,like what is going to get six over seven minus one
331,3,2,00:21:55.078,00:21:56.844,00:00:01.766,,because y is one basically
332,3,2,00:21:57.383,00:22:10.942,00:00:13.559,well so when you're subtracting that y the y pause filler is really just can be pause filler a negative seven over seven y right,
333,3,2,00:22:10.942,00:22:18.528,00:00:07.586,so then it would just be a negative thirteen over seven y when you subtract them together,
334,3,2,00:22:18.156,00:22:18.543,00:00:00.387,,all right
335,3,2,00:22:26.337,00:22:26.417,00:00:00.080,,so
336,3,2,00:22:30.887,00:22:33.142,00:00:02.255,so then once you have that y,
337,3,2,00:22:47.000,00:22:47.639,00:00:00.639,you have that,
338,3,2,00:22:47.639,00:22:51.525,00:00:03.886,and then you just want to multiply it by seven over thirteen,
339,3,2,00:22:53.525,00:22:55.431,00:00:01.906,mm-hmm that's lovely,
340,3,2,00:22:56.469,00:22:59.140,00:00:02.671,,so what's eighty-six times seven
341,3,2,00:23:00.192,00:23:00.861,00:00:00.669,emm,
342,3,2,00:23:03.433,00:23:07.000,00:00:03.567,I dont know okay (inaudible) okay eight six times seven two two,
343,3,2,00:23:35.797,00:23:36.772,00:00:00.975,maybe six hundred and two,
344,3,2,00:23:38.447,00:23:39.091,00:00:00.644,,all right
345,3,2,00:23:41.398,00:23:42.478,00:00:01.080,, so six hundred two and then 
346,3,2,00:23:45.913,00:23:50.815,00:00:04.902,,that is over over negative thirteen 
347,3,2,00:23:47.417,00:23:47.785,00:00:00.368,divide,
348,3,2,00:23:51.043,00:23:51.435,00:00:00.392,yeah,
349,3,2,00:23:52.410,00:23:54.036,00:00:01.626,,I'm just going to go with that you know
350,3,2,00:23:56.481,00:23:58.537,00:00:02.056,put a little negative sign then,
351,3,2,00:23:58.650,00:23:59.177,00:00:00.527,there we go,
352,3,2,00:24:00.539,00:24:01.876,00:00:01.337,,all right let's move onto the next one
353,3,2,00:24:03.002,00:24:06.196,00:00:03.194,,all right so let's just start off by adding a two
354,3,2,00:24:19.754,00:24:22.374,00:00:02.620,,so this cancels out then
355,3,2,00:24:23.355,00:24:23.773,00:00:00.418,yep,
356,3,2,00:24:29.173,00:24:30.750,00:00:01.577,and then you just have,
357,3,2,00:24:31.871,00:24:32.656,00:00:00.785,,one hundred
358,3,2,00:24:33.276,00:24:33.730,00:00:00.454,yep {laughter},
359,3,2,00:24:35.091,00:24:35.478,00:00:00.387,,so
360,3,2,00:24:36.407,00:24:36.986,00:00:00.579,you have,
361,3,2,00:24:38.073,00:24:41.924,00:00:03.851,,plus ten over third x
362,3,2,00:24:41.924,00:24:45.776,00:00:03.852,,and then negative eleven x is left over on the other side
363,3,2,00:24:46.354,00:24:52.890,00:00:06.536,,so now you want to add eleven x right
364,3,2,00:24:53.089,00:24:59.904,00:00:06.815,,so then would that be if you're adding eleven x would that be
365,3,2,00:25:06.504,00:25:09.262,00:00:02.758,pause filler wait if you're adding wait if you're adding elevenx,
366,3,2,00:25:09.701,00:25:13.732,00:00:04.031,,would that be eleven and then ten over three
367,3,2,00:25:14.830,00:25:23.470,00:00:08.640,okay if you're going to do that then on the other side you have zero equals scribble,
368,3,2,00:25:24.578,00:25:32.450,00:00:07.872,so then you only want you want to have x on one side and the hundred on the other,
369,3,2,00:25:32.769,00:25:36.411,00:00:03.642,so you don't want to do that,
370,3,2,00:25:36.411,00:25:40.821,00:00:04.410,you would either have to pause filler put the hundred on the other side or,
371,3,2,00:25:40.821,00:25:44.203,00:00:03.382,you would have to subtract your ten x (inaudible),
372,3,2,00:25:50.501,00:25:51.407,00:00:00.906,do you get that,
373,3,2,00:25:53.173,00:25:54.190,00:00:01.017,,all right so pause filler
374,3,2,00:26:00.190,00:26:02.042,00:00:01.852,so which one would you rather do,
375,3,2,00:26:03.072,00:26:05.235,00:00:02.163,so you could either subtract a hundred,
376,3,2,00:26:05.694,00:26:08.019,00:00:02.325,or you could subtract ten x,
377,3,2,00:26:10.004,00:26:14.484,00:00:04.480,the ten x will probably have less steps in here because you already put a hundred on one side,
378,3,2,00:26:14.680,00:26:15.288,00:00:00.608,,alright
379,3,2,00:26:16.257,00:26:17.386,00:00:01.129,,so subtract ten x
380,3,2,00:26:28.749,00:26:38.978,00:00:10.229,,that would be negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three
381,3,2,00:26:40.884,00:26:42.670,00:00:01.786,wait wait pause filler,
382,3,2,00:26:47.330,00:26:48.655,00:00:01.325,yeah it looks right,
383,3,2,00:26:49.265,00:26:50.442,00:00:01.177,,three x or three
384,3,2,00:26:52.647,00:26:58.228,00:00:05.581,well you pause filler wait one second sorry,
385,3,2,00:26:58.557,00:26:59.005,00:00:00.448,,it is okay
386,3,2,00:27:03.523,00:27:04.032,00:00:00.509,wait a minute pause filler,
387,3,2,00:27:04.979,00:27:08.900,00:00:03.921,I'm sorry I like zoned out for a couple second wait,
388,3,2,00:27:08.900,00:27:12.422,00:00:03.522,so you added the eleven x,
389,3,2,00:27:12.422,00:27:13.698,00:00:01.276,is that what you ended up doing,
390,3,2,00:27:22.107,00:27:26.840,00:00:04.733,,pause filler I well then you say that you could subtract ten x from both sides
391,3,2,00:27:26.840,00:27:28.227,00:00:01.387,yeah so is that what you did,
392,3,2,00:27:28.386,00:27:28.785,00:00:00.399,,yeah so
393,3,2,00:27:28.785,00:27:28.935,00:00:00.150,okay so,
394,3,2,00:27:28.935,00:27:34.083,00:00:05.148,,so negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three
395,3,2,00:27:34.083,00:27:34.562,00:00:00.479,no no no,
396,3,2,00:27:34.562,00:27:39.072,00:00:04.510,so your question is would it be a negative twenty-one x,
397,3,2,00:27:39.800,00:27:41.945,00:00:02.145,because you still have to divide it by three,
398,3,2,00:27:41.945,00:27:42.823,00:00:00.878,so I'm pretty sure it won't,
399,3,2,00:27:43.103,00:27:45.388,00:00:02.285,but yeah I'm getting confused,
400,3,2,00:27:45.687,00:27:48.131,00:00:02.444,wait no wait no,
401,3,2,00:27:48.131,00:27:56.442,00:00:08.311,you can't do that yeah because pause filler yeah you can't put the divided by three thing underneath that because that wouldn't work,
402,3,2,00:27:58.019,00:28:01.531,00:00:03.512,so ten over three,
403,3,2,00:28:02.628,00:28:03.776,00:00:01.148,,so you would have to
404,3,2,00:28:03.776,00:28:12.506,00:00:08.730,so your negative eleven x because negative eleven is like over one and,
405,3,2,00:28:12.606,00:28:15.140,00:00:02.534,,wouldn't you multiply it by three x probably
406,3,2,00:28:16.587,00:28:22.334,00:00:05.747,well you're not trying to get rid well you're trying to get rid on that side by subtraction not multiplication,
407,3,2,00:28:23.780,00:28:25.067,00:00:01.287,so what you can do,
408,3,2,00:28:26.444,00:28:29.697,00:00:03.253,,It's going good
409,3,2,00:28:33.009,00:28:33.528,00:00:00.519,,all right
410,3,2,00:28:48.973,00:28:49.332,00:00:00.359,,okay
411,3,2,00:28:50.809,00:28:58.342,00:00:07.533,okay,
412,3,2,00:29:35.128,00:29:35.388,00:00:00.260,,okay
413,3,2,00:29:46.484,00:29:47.350,00:00:00.866,,what did you get
414,3,2,00:29:48.324,00:29:49.300,00:00:00.976,Skittles as well,
415,3,2,00:29:49.560,00:29:51.595,00:00:02.035,I haven't had Skittles in like forever,
416,3,2,00:29:51.766,00:29:52.435,00:00:00.669,,me neither
417,3,2,00:30:11.520,00:30:16.398,00:00:04.878,huh that is somewhat weird on the back it says a blue one is blue raspberry,
418,3,2,00:30:16.664,00:30:18.420,00:00:01.756,but it doesn't say like blue raspberry,
419,3,2,00:30:18.420,00:30:19.637,00:00:01.217,it just says raspberry,
420,3,2,00:30:20.787,00:30:24.606,00:00:03.819,,okay so you know what like those marshmallow Peeps are right
421,3,2,00:30:23.760,00:30:24.386,00:00:00.626,mm-hmm,
422,3,2,00:30:24.705,00:30:27.768,00:00:03.063,,so my mom just buy pause filler Peeps
423,3,2,00:30:27.768,00:30:30.652,00:00:02.884,,but they're blue raspberry flavored
424,3,2,00:30:31.021,00:30:33.116,00:00:02.095,,and it was really weird
425,3,2,00:30:34.447,00:30:35.478,00:00:01.031,it sounds weird,
426,3,2,00:30:38.812,00:30:40.559,00:00:01.747,I should've known they're flavored Peeps,
427,3,2,00:30:40.559,00:30:42.485,00:00:01.926,I thought they were just marshmallow flavored,
428,3,2,00:30:42.485,00:30:42.904,00:00:00.419,,me too (laughter)
429,3,2,00:30:44.484,00:30:45.331,00:00:00.847,and sugar on top,
430,3,2,00:30:48.851,00:30:54.198,00:00:05.347,,so until now I mean they have them for Easter Christmas Halloween every holiday basically
431,3,2,00:31:34.810,00:31:36.613,00:00:01.803,,these are probably my new favorite type of Skittles
432,3,2,00:31:37.429,00:31:38.917,00:00:01.488,I don't really like the new green ones,
433,3,2,00:31:41.745,00:31:42.434,00:00:00.689,,melon berry
434,3,2,00:31:42.434,00:31:42.563,00:00:00.129,I know,
435,3,2,00:31:45.852,00:31:48.018,00:00:02.166,okay come on see what flavor just we got to try,
436,3,2,00:31:52.846,00:31:53.625,00:00:00.779,there's a red one,
437,3,2,00:32:24.361,00:32:26.617,00:00:02.256,,so would you want to go to college here
438,3,2,00:32:27.614,00:32:29.288,00:00:01.674,pause filler I mean I think so,
439,3,2,00:32:29.417,00:32:34.012,00:00:04.595,I don't know because there's like I mean it's a nice school,
440,3,2,00:32:37.736,00:32:38.877,00:00:01.141,so yeah I'm not actually sure,
441,3,2,00:32:39.331,00:32:41.147,00:00:01.816,like I'm not actually sure what I want to major in I guess so,
442,3,2,00:32:42.778,00:32:45.073,00:00:02.295,,you don't have any idea what you want to be when you grow up
443,3,2,00:32:47.561,00:32:49.277,00:00:01.716,somewhat but not really,
444,3,2,00:32:50.475,00:32:51.702,00:00:01.227,,what is your somewhat idea
445,3,2,00:32:52.331,00:32:53.220,00:00:00.889,I don't know,
446,3,2,00:32:54.122,00:32:58.412,00:00:04.290,maybe I'm thinking maybe I'd be like a computer scientist or something like that-ish,
447,3,2,00:32:59.196,00:33:00.202,00:00:01.006,you know I like computers,
448,3,2,00:33:00.467,00:33:01.754,00:00:01.287,,that's cool
449,3,2,00:33:02.144,00:33:03.461,00:00:01.317,what about you,
450,3,2,00:33:04.300,00:33:09.671,00:00:05.371,,well as I told you last week I'm really into like theater and stuff
451,3,2,00:33:10.122,00:33:10.967,00:00:00.845,,and I do musical theater
452,3,2,00:33:10.967,00:33:12.945,00:00:01.978,,and I do shows and everything
453,3,2,00:33:14.529,00:33:16.644,00:00:02.115,,and CMU is probably like one of the
454,3,2,00:33:16.644,00:33:17.203,00:00:00.559,yeah,
455,3,2,00:33:17.203,00:33:19.827,00:00:02.624,,it's one of the best like stuff for theater in the country
456,3,2,00:33:20.795,00:33:23.888,00:00:03.093,,so this is like my dream school to go here for that
457,3,2,00:33:25.584,00:33:28.886,00:00:03.302,oh yeah yeah it's sort of weird because,
458,3,2,00:33:28.886,00:33:37.457,00:00:08.571,you don't really because you know pause filler this school it's like has a really good computer science and theater thing,
459,3,2,00:33:37.457,00:33:39.343,00:00:01.886,which is sort of a weird combination,
460,3,2,00:33:39.552,00:33:40.021,00:00:00.469,,yeah
461,3,2,00:33:46.766,00:33:49.370,00:00:02.604,,the purple I don't know if I really like the purple ones
462,3,2,00:33:50.118,00:33:50.585,00:00:00.467,let's see,
463,3,2,00:33:52.563,00:33:53.698,00:00:01.135,the red ones are okay,
464,3,2,00:33:54.000,00:33:54.917,00:00:00.917,I don't really like the green ones,
465,3,2,00:33:54.917,00:33:56.603,00:00:01.686,I haven't tried the purple ones yet,
466,3,2,00:33:58.150,00:33:58.409,00:00:00.259,,heh
467,3,2,00:34:04.725,00:34:08.484,00:00:03.759,like the ones are like best so far are the blue ones I think you know,
468,3,2,00:34:34.380,00:34:35.876,00:00:01.496,I like the purple ones they're the best,
469,3,2,00:34:53.974,00:34:56.189,00:00:02.215,,all of these kind of remind me of a holiday
470,3,2,00:34:56.966,00:34:57.465,00:00:00.499,really,
471,3,2,00:34:58.034,00:34:59.361,00:00:01.327,,I know it's kind of weird to say
472,3,2,00:34:59.361,00:35:01.286,00:00:01.925,,but the blue ones kind of remind me of Easter
473,3,2,00:35:03.350,00:35:05.815,00:00:02.465,,and the red ones remind me of the Valentine's day just like the taste
474,3,2,00:35:05.944,00:35:07.656,00:00:01.712,,and the purple ones remind me Christmas
475,3,2,00:35:10.427,00:35:12.000,00:00:01.573,the purple ones feel sort of summery,
476,3,2,00:35:34.367,00:35:36.643,00:00:02.276,I (inaudible) the purple ones would have to taste like the fourth of July,
477,3,2,00:35:37.566,00:35:37.895,00:00:00.329,huh,
478,3,2,00:35:37.935,00:35:38.224,00:00:00.289,yes,
479,3,2,00:36:08.428,00:36:10.072,00:00:01.644,,all right so
480,3,2,00:36:11.656,00:36:13.190,00:00:01.534,,first you are going to
481,3,2,00:36:13.625,00:36:15.318,00:00:01.693,one second I don't have that thing up,
482,3,2,00:36:15.559,00:36:16.866,00:00:01.307,are you in Chrome,
483,3,2,00:36:16.866,00:36:18.222,00:00:01.356,is that it,
484,3,2,00:36:21.582,00:36:23.110,00:00:01.528,are you in Chrome for the browser,
485,3,2,00:36:24.806,00:36:27.021,00:00:02.215,,pause filler I'm not sure
486,3,2,00:36:28.509,00:36:29.104,00:00:00.595,one sec,
487,3,2,00:36:30.024,00:36:31.082,00:00:01.058,oh yeah you are,
488,3,2,00:36:31.132,00:36:32.767,00:00:01.635,but one second let me open up,
489,3,2,00:36:36.907,00:36:37.754,00:00:00.847,so you're on,
490,3,2,00:36:39.564,00:36:40.468,00:00:00.904,,where did the pen go
491,3,2,00:36:42.128,00:36:42.516,00:00:00.388,,what the heck
492,3,2,00:36:44.402,00:36:48.283,00:00:03.881,is your thing set up as one over x equals twenty-five,
493,3,2,00:36:49.171,00:36:49.411,00:00:00.240,,yes
494,3,2,00:36:50.459,00:36:50.628,00:00:00.169,okay,
495,3,2,00:36:51.628,00:36:52.514,00:00:00.886,,oh my gosh
496,3,2,00:36:52.514,00:36:53.482,00:00:00.968,,where did the pen go
497,3,2,00:36:56.136,00:36:57.482,00:00:01.346,,I swear I'm going insane
498,3,2,00:36:57.816,00:36:58.171,00:00:00.355,,one second
499,3,2,00:37:45.082,00:37:45.658,00:00:00.576,did you find it,
500,3,2,00:37:46.110,00:37:46.576,00:00:00.466,,yeah
501,3,2,00:37:47.153,00:37:47.864,00:00:00.711,what was it,
502,3,2,00:37:49.426,00:37:50.063,00:00:00.637,,he had the pen
503,3,2,00:37:50.063,00:37:51.714,00:00:01.651,,he certainly grabbed it
504,3,2,00:37:53.491,00:37:53.932,00:00:00.441,,all right
505,3,2,00:37:55.061,00:37:55.270,00:00:00.209,okay,
506,3,2,00:37:55.258,00:37:55.601,00:00:00.343,,so
507,3,2,00:38:00.104,00:38:01.349,00:00:01.245,,now do you know how to do this
508,3,2,00:38:01.349,00:38:04.510,00:00:03.161,,we're going to start off by multiplying by x on both sides
509,3,2,00:38:05.411,00:38:05.957,00:00:00.546,okay,
510,3,2,00:38:06.146,00:38:06.539,00:00:00.393,so,
511,3,2,00:38:10.674,00:38:12.601,00:00:01.927,you multiply by x on the scribble,
512,3,2,00:38:14.000,00:38:16.553,00:00:02.553,,well actually never mind
513,3,2,00:38:17.082,00:38:17.930,00:00:00.848,,that was wrong
514,3,2,00:38:18.043,00:38:18.601,00:00:00.558,,wait
515,3,2,00:38:21.130,00:38:22.938,00:00:01.808,, I'm looking at the tutor worksheet
516,3,2,00:38:33.105,00:38:35.600,00:00:02.495,,yeah you do multiply both sides by x okay
517,3,2,00:38:35.816,00:38:36.668,00:00:00.852,okay so,
518,3,2,00:38:38.784,00:38:40.533,00:00:01.749, and so you multiply that by x,
519,3,2,00:38:42.274,00:38:46.605,00:00:04.331,then you get one x over x,
520,3,2,00:38:46.654,00:38:48.021,00:00:01.367,so that could be one,
521,3,2,00:38:48.021,00:38:50.955,00:00:02.934,,oh yeah that would just be one no x on this side
522,3,2,00:38:50.955,00:38:52.820,00:00:01.865,,after you multiply on this side
523,3,2,00:38:52.820,00:38:54.048,00:00:01.228,,after you multiply it by x
524,3,2,00:38:55.846,00:38:56.570,00:00:00.724,,it pause filler it cancels out the x
525,3,2,00:38:56.570,00:38:59.116,00:00:02.546,,so then that would be twenty-five x
526,3,2,00:38:59.791,00:39:00.147,00:00:00.356,yeah,
527,3,2,00:39:01.533,00:39:01.865,00:00:00.332, so,
528,3,2,00:39:02.565,00:39:05.289,00:00:02.724,, then you divide it by twenty-five on both sides
529,3,2,00:39:07.128,00:39:07.487,00:00:00.359,okay,
530,3,2,00:39:15.220,00:39:21.256,00:00:06.036,okay so then you have x equals one over twenty-five,
531,3,2,00:39:38.546,00:39:40.711,00:00:02.165,,all right oh you all right okay
532,3,2,00:39:43.605,00:39:47.626,00:00:04.021,,so you want to start off by adding seventeen
533,3,2,00:39:47.626,00:39:48.663,00:00:01.037,,now what do you do next
534,3,2,00:39:48.663,00:39:51.208,00:00:02.545,,you add a number to the sides
535,3,2,00:39:51.208,00:39:53.672,00:00:02.464,okay pause filler okay yeah it makes sense,
536,3,2,00:39:53.672,00:39:55.817,00:00:02.145,so you just add the seventeen,
537,3,2,00:39:59.649,00:40:02.372,00:00:02.723,and then you would get eighty,
538,3,2,00:40:02.372,00:40:06.663,00:00:04.291,,yeah so negative three over y equals eighty
539,3,2,00:40:11.761,00:40:14.744,00:00:02.983,,now you want to multiply it by y on both sides
540,3,2,00:40:14.874,00:40:24.502,00:00:09.628,okay so one pause filler negative three equals eighty-y,
541,3,2,00:40:25.560,00:40:30.598,00:00:05.038,this you would want to divide it by y,
542,3,2,00:40:34.900,00:40:36.575,00:00:01.675,no you would want to divide it by,
543,3,2,00:40:36.575,00:40:37.951,00:00:01.376,no you would want to divide by,
544,3,2,00:40:37.951,00:40:38.351,00:00:00.400,,eighty
545,3,2,00:40:38.750,00:40:39.288,00:00:00.538,eighty,
546,3,2,00:40:46.815,00:40:52.820,00:00:06.005,so then you would get y equals negative three over eighty,
547,3,2,00:40:53.037,00:40:57.527,00:00:04.490,that must be okay that was this is beautiful okay,
548,3,2,00:41:02.545,00:41:03.606,00:00:01.061,okay next,
549,3,2,00:41:03.615,00:41:04.394,00:00:00.779,,all right
550,3,2,00:41:06.331,00:41:09.656,00:00:03.325,,so two hundred ten equals negative fourteen over y
551,3,2,00:41:09.659,00:41:11.330,00:00:01.671,,what do you think your first step is going to be
552,3,2,00:41:12.762,00:41:15.646,00:00:02.884,pause filler so you multiply it by y yeah,
553,3,2,00:41:17.846,00:41:19.557,00:00:01.711,,so that cancels that out on this side
554,3,2,00:41:19.707,00:41:22.131,00:00:02.424,,and then you can equal two hundred ten
555,3,2,00:41:22.131,00:41:23.887,00:00:01.756,so you got negative yes,
556,3,2,00:41:23.887,00:41:31.767,00:00:07.880,and then you get two hundred and ten y equals negative fourteen,
557,3,2,00:41:32.976,00:41:40.263,00:00:07.287,okay so after you do that you pause filler want to divide everything by twenty-five,
558,3,2,00:41:42.680,00:41:43.545,00:00:00.865,,yeah so you
559,3,2,00:41:50.558,00:41:52.828,00:00:02.270,, so you're left with y on one side
560,3,2,00:41:54.288,00:41:56.526,00:00:02.238,,because the two hundred ten is canceled out
561,3,2,00:41:57.294,00:41:57.846,00:00:00.552,mm-hmm,
562,3,2,00:42:00.276,00:42:01.159,00:00:00.883,you're both uh-huh ,
563,3,2,00:42:04.889,00:42:06.411,00:00:01.522, wait seven ,
564,3,2,00:42:16.908,00:42:18.086,00:00:01.178,that looks good,
565,3,2,00:42:20.558,00:42:21.558,00:00:01.000,okay so,
566,3,2,00:42:23.300,00:42:24.153,00:00:00.853,this one,
567,3,2,00:42:24.515,00:42:26.625,00:00:02.110,,you want to start off by adding twenty-four to both sides
568,3,2,00:42:34.503,00:42:35.215,00:00:00.712,and then,
569,3,2,00:42:37.798,00:42:44.220,00:00:06.422,one hundred thirty-seven equals five over x,
570,3,2,00:42:47.220,00:42:50.231,00:00:03.011,and then like the other ones you would want to multiply it by x,
571,3,2,00:42:50.570,00:42:51.099,00:00:00.529,,correct
572,3,2,00:42:54.288,00:43:01.607,00:00:07.319,and one hundred thirty-seven x equals five ,
573,3,2,00:43:05.294,00:43:06.754,00:00:01.460,divided by hundred thirty-seven,
574,3,2,00:43:07.513,00:43:07.872,00:00:00.359,,perfect
575,3,2,00:43:10.036,00:43:10.496,00:00:00.460,yep,
576,3,2,00:43:11.907,00:43:13.122,00:00:01.215,x equals ,
577,3,2,00:43:16.497,00:43:17.061,00:00:00.564,ah,
578,3,2,00:43:18.264,00:43:21.331,00:00:03.067,one hundred thirty-seven yeah,
579,3,2,00:43:29.036,00:43:29.588,00:00:00.552,,you got it
580,3,2,00:43:30.171,00:43:31.466,00:00:01.295,yeah okay,
581,3,2,00:43:32.373,00:43:33.336,00:00:00.963,next one,
582,3,2,00:43:35.429,00:43:35.987,00:00:00.558,,yup
583,3,2,00:43:36.915,00:43:37.479,00:00:00.564,brah,
584,3,2,00:43:39.270,00:43:39.613,00:00:00.343,yeah,
585,3,2,00:43:39.806,00:43:41.722,00:00:01.916,,all right oh so this is different
586,3,2,00:43:42.722,00:43:43.271,00:00:00.549,yeah,
587,3,2,00:43:43.000,00:43:46.713,00:00:03.713,,so you negative thirty-nine is smaller
588,3,2,00:43:46.713,00:43:50.000,00:00:03.287,,so you probably want to start off by adding thirty-nine to both sides
589,3,2,00:43:53.135,00:43:53.785,00:00:00.650,ah,
590,3,2,00:43:54.012,00:43:54.896,00:00:00.884,well what if,
591,3,2,00:43:57.010,00:43:58.027,00:00:01.017, yeah it makes sense,
592,3,2,00:44:05.131,00:44:10.759,00:00:05.628,,so remember that seventeen over x and twelve over x are like terms
593,3,2,00:44:11.188,00:44:17.743,00:00:06.555,,so you probably want to subtract twelve x from both sides
594,3,2,00:44:18.581,00:44:20.885,00:00:02.304,yeah okay one second,
595,3,2,00:44:20.885,00:44:22.452,00:00:01.567,let me just get this up,
596,3,2,00:44:22.452,00:44:27.720,00:00:05.268,equals twelve x or soon not to be twelve x,
597,3,2,00:44:27.810,00:44:33.676,00:00:05.866,oh it's twenty-one (inaudible) eighteen eighteen,
598,3,2,00:44:36.742,00:44:45.264,00:00:08.522,we can subtract that to get pause filler five over x equals eighteen,
599,3,2,00:44:46.198,00:44:47.086,00:00:00.888,,all right yup
600,3,2,00:44:47.086,00:44:56.495,00:00:09.409,multiply it by x to get five pause filler equals eighteen x,
601,3,2,00:44:56.495,00:45:05.055,00:00:08.560,and we can divide by eighteen to get on with over here pause filler,
602,3,2,00:45:06.711,00:45:10.962,00:00:04.251,five over eighteen equals x,
603,3,2,00:45:15.214,00:45:16.788,00:00:01.574,that's so sloppy,
604,3,2,00:45:16.938,00:45:17.357,00:00:00.419,and x,
605,3,2,00:45:18.680,00:45:19.784,00:00:01.104,and next,
606,3,2,00:45:21.109,00:45:23.208,00:00:02.099,,all right so this one is very similar
607,3,2,00:45:24.700,00:45:25.903,00:00:01.203,,so negative nine and two are smaller
608,3,2,00:45:26.122,00:45:27.472,00:00:01.350,,so what would you do with that
609,3,2,00:45:29.000,00:45:32.588,00:00:03.588,pause filler so you would want to you want to add it,
610,3,2,00:45:38.579,00:45:42.264,00:00:03.685,and you get plus another ninety-two,
611,3,2,00:45:45.264,00:46:00.719,00:00:15.455,okay pause filler then you have three x equals pause filler a hundred and three plus twelve x,
612,3,2,00:46:01.048,00:46:03.700,00:00:02.652,and then you want to subtract with twelve x,
613,3,2,00:46:04.510,00:46:06.326,00:00:01.816,get rid of that until (inaudible),
614,3,2,00:46:06.326,00:46:08.541,00:00:02.215,,well twelve over x remember
615,3,2,00:46:08.960,00:46:10.037,00:00:01.077,oh yeah (laughter),
616,3,2,00:46:10.297,00:46:13.240,00:00:02.943,,but it's okay you still subtract
617,3,2,00:46:13.400,00:46:13.689,00:00:00.289,here,
618,3,2,00:46:13.689,00:46:18.688,00:00:04.999,,but you should subtract pause filler three x right three over x first
619,3,2,00:46:19.466,00:46:20.973,00:00:01.507,you did that one,
620,3,2,00:46:20.973,00:46:27.089,00:00:06.116,it could be a zero equals a hundred three plus fifteen x,
621,3,2,00:46:29.089,00:46:34.093,00:00:05.004,,no because if you're subtracting pause filler three over x on from twelve
622,3,2,00:46:34.502,00:46:40.528,00:00:06.026,,then it would be pause filler nine over x like one hundred three
623,3,2,00:46:40.528,00:46:44.679,00:00:04.151,pause filler yeah one second yeah,
624,3,2,00:46:44.998,00:46:47.712,00:00:02.714,,oh well actually right you're right sorry
625,3,2,00:46:47.712,00:46:48.650,00:00:00.938,okay,
626,3,2,00:46:48.650,00:46:49.827,00:00:01.177,,so you would subtract twelve x
627,3,2,00:46:49.827,00:46:53.139,00:00:03.312,,because three x is on the other equal side of the
628,3,2,00:46:53.139,00:46:59.126,00:00:05.987,okay so minus twelve x,
629,3,2,00:47:03.637,00:47:05.570,00:00:01.933,yeah that's a beautiful x (laughter),
630,3,2,00:47:07.497,00:47:14.730,00:00:07.233,so then you know being negative nine yeah negative yeah twelve over x,
631,3,2,00:47:14.730,00:47:21.315,00:00:06.585,and we got negative nine x equals a hundred and three,
632,3,2,00:47:26.000,00:47:26.926,00:00:00.926,that makes sense,
633,3,2,00:47:28.010,00:47:29.367,00:00:01.357,okay and then,
634,3,2,00:47:29.368,00:47:30.276,00:00:00.908,,you divide by
635,3,2,00:47:35.975,00:47:37.398,00:00:01.423,,well you so you multiply I mean
636,3,2,00:47:40.601,00:47:43.816,00:00:03.215,I guess you could divide right,
637,3,2,00:47:44.889,00:47:45.515,00:00:00.626,maybe,
638,3,2,00:47:52.681,00:47:54.270,00:00:01.589,I think you could divide,
639,3,2,00:48:00.699,00:48:01.362,00:00:00.663,okay,
640,3,2,00:48:06.064,00:48:10.264,00:00:04.200,x wait no nine equals,
641,3,2,00:48:10.264,00:48:12.639,00:00:02.375,,how do you get your screen to go lower
642,3,2,00:48:12.639,00:48:14.365,00:00:01.726,,because I can't see what you're doing
643,3,2,00:48:14.932,00:48:15.607,00:00:00.675,you can't ,
644,3,2,00:48:19.454,00:48:22.367,00:00:02.913,see how far can you see to what I'm doing,
645,3,2,00:48:24.222,00:48:25.470,00:00:01.248,,I can see
646,3,2,00:48:27.319,00:48:29.371,00:00:02.052,here I'm going to write a bunch of numbers,
647,3,2,00:48:29.371,00:48:30.817,00:00:01.446,tell me which ones you can see,
648,3,2,00:48:30.817,00:48:32.214,00:00:01.397,can you see any of those,
649,3,2,00:48:32.593,00:48:34.280,00:00:01.687,,I can see one two three and four
650,3,2,00:48:34.659,00:48:36.954,00:00:02.295,okay so you can't see five and six pause filler,
651,3,2,00:48:36.954,00:48:41.580,00:00:04.626,okay now I'll get rid of those pause filler okay pause filler,
652,3,2,00:48:44.237,00:48:51.680,00:00:07.443,huh is your pause filler scribbler screen like fully like,
653,3,2,00:48:51.680,00:48:55.252,00:00:03.572,is it from like one end to the screen all the way up to the other,
654,3,2,00:48:56.619,00:48:59.000,00:00:02.381,,well it is now because I've just made it bigger but it's
655,3,2,00:49:00.353,00:49:02.402,00:00:02.049,can you see nine equals one hundred threex,
656,3,2,00:49:05.970,00:49:06.602,00:00:00.632,,yes I
657,3,2,00:49:08.349,00:49:08.754,00:00:00.405,,wait
658,3,2,00:49:11.270,00:49:11.939,00:00:00.669,,it's okay
659,3,2,00:49:12.263,00:49:13.201,00:00:00.938,,just keep working
660,3,2,00:49:13.201,00:49:14.798,00:00:01.597,,I can fix it
661,3,2,00:49:16.803,00:49:17.471,00:00:00.668,,just keep working
662,3,2,00:49:17.471,00:49:17.900,00:00:00.429,,it's okay
663,3,2,00:49:18.595,00:49:19.545,00:00:00.950,ops one second,
664,3,2,00:49:24.000,00:49:25.362,00:00:01.362,actually a way to scroll down,
665,3,2,00:49:25.577,00:49:28.267,00:00:02.690,you can just probably use a scroll button pause filler,
666,3,2,00:49:28.267,00:49:28.610,00:00:00.343,no that one,
667,3,2,00:49:28.693,00:49:29.085,00:00:00.392,like okay,
668,3,2,00:49:29.570,00:49:29.877,00:00:00.307,yeah okay,
669,3,2,00:49:31.559,00:49:33.156,00:00:01.597,I'll just try and go with it,
670,3,2,00:49:34.323,00:49:38.314,00:00:03.991,so then I go pause filler one hundred and three x oh (laughter) pause filler,
671,3,2,00:49:43.033,00:49:45.278,00:00:02.245,yes you divide a hundred and three,
672,3,2,00:49:45.278,00:49:50.602,00:00:05.324,so you got nine over a hundred and three equals x,
673,3,2,00:49:53.200,00:49:57.630,00:00:04.430,there we go okay,
674,3,2,00:49:59.147,00:50:01.511,00:00:02.364,and next one,
675,3,2,00:50:02.958,00:50:06.400,00:00:03.442,,all right so twenty-five is smaller
676,3,2,00:50:06.400,00:50:09.000,00:00:02.600,,so you want to start up by subtracting that from both sides right
677,3,2,00:50:10.129,00:50:11.086,00:00:00.957,ah yeah,
678,3,2,00:50:23.012,00:50:23.503,00:00:00.491,come on,
679,3,2,00:50:24.369,00:50:28.707,00:00:04.338,that's sort of like I just want to know what that looks like,
680,3,2,00:50:30.136,00:50:46.589,00:00:16.453,then got one over x no wait and then that will be plus thirty-five equals nine over x,
681,3,2,00:50:49.871,00:50:53.962,00:00:04.091,and then since you have that already,
682,3,2,00:50:54.351,00:50:58.173,00:00:03.822,you want to get rid of the one over x,
683,3,2,00:50:58.482,00:51:00.577,00:00:02.095,and it's just the bottoms all (inaudible) is,
684,3,2,00:51:00.577,00:51:01.864,00:00:01.287,you can just subtract that,
685,3,2,00:51:01.864,00:51:04.299,00:00:02.435,,yes so you subtract one over x on both sides
686,3,2,00:51:04.738,00:51:05.975,00:00:01.237,,and then you would end up with
687,3,2,00:51:06.953,00:51:09.916,00:00:02.963,thirty-five equals eight overx,
688,3,2,00:51:13.245,00:51:19.000,00:00:05.755,,so then you would want to multiply it by x on both sides to cancel out the x on this side
689,3,2,00:51:19.402,00:51:24.632,00:00:05.230,well I was thinking pause filler since pause filler since the wait,
690,3,2,00:51:24.942,00:51:27.207,00:00:02.265,you could try dividing by eight,
691,3,2,00:51:27.207,00:51:28.841,00:00:01.634,do you think that would work,
692,3,2,00:51:30.240,00:51:34.793,00:00:04.553,,well on my tutor sheet it doesn't say anything about dividing by eight so
693,3,2,00:51:38.641,00:51:44.158,00:00:05.517,,I think you would just I think that it would just pause filler give you extra steps that you don't plan
694,3,2,00:51:44.537,00:51:52.150,00:00:07.613,well maybe well I guess if you multiply if you divide it by x when you just have x right x by itself,
695,3,2,00:51:53.646,00:51:56.001,00:00:02.355,,no because it's dividing anyway
696,3,2,00:51:56.001,00:51:58.166,00:00:02.165,,like eight it is divided by x anyway so pause filler
697,3,2,00:51:58.865,00:52:01.249,00:00:02.384,,you would have to multiply it or something
698,3,2,00:52:01.279,00:52:02.716,00:00:01.437,,but it just it's pause filler
699,3,2,00:52:05.659,00:52:06.210,00:00:00.551,okay,
700,3,2,00:52:06.230,00:52:07.873,00:00:01.643,,it would be too complicated I guess
701,3,2,00:52:11.405,00:52:12.773,00:00:01.368,,on all of the things it says to
702,3,2,00:52:14.760,00:52:15.632,00:00:00.872,multiply x,
703,3,2,00:52:16.724,00:52:17.264,00:00:00.540,,yeah
704,3,2,00:52:20.765,00:52:20.994,00:00:00.229,okay,
705,3,2,00:52:21.154,00:52:26.731,00:00:05.577,wait so then you get thirty-five x equals eight,
706,3,2,00:52:26.731,00:52:28.843,00:00:02.112,or so we just divide it by thirty-five,
707,3,2,00:52:30.443,00:52:38.907,00:00:08.464,and you get x equals like could you see that stuff on the bottom I was doing,
708,3,2,00:52:40.779,00:52:41.358,00:00:00.579,,pause filler no I couldn't
709,3,2,00:52:41.358,00:52:42.812,00:00:01.454,,but I can see what you're doing right now
710,3,2,00:52:42.812,00:52:45.510,00:00:02.698,okay x equals eight over thirty-five pause filler,
711,3,2,00:52:50.320,00:52:55.208,00:00:04.888,but on this problem could you just draw a line at the bottom of the page that where you can see,
712,3,2,00:52:55.711,00:52:56.221,00:00:00.510,,yeah
713,3,2,00:52:56.356,00:52:57.368,00:00:01.012,okay that way,
714,3,2,00:53:01.816,00:53:02.656,00:00:00.840,,all right wait
715,3,2,00:53:07.840,00:53:08.399,00:00:00.559,okay,
716,3,2,00:53:12.282,00:53:13.969,00:00:01.687,okay so you can see all the stuff,
717,3,2,00:53:15.710,00:53:21.896,00:00:06.186,,all right so you're going to start off by subtracting twenty-two
718,3,2,00:53:26.634,00:53:29.858,00:00:03.224,and then you get a hundred and three,
719,3,2,00:53:31.295,00:53:31.514,00:00:00.219,,yup
720,3,2,00:53:31.953,00:53:36.762,00:00:04.809,plus ten x and then ninex,
721,3,2,00:53:44.957,00:53:45.595,00:00:00.638,and then,
722,3,2,00:53:47.466,00:53:49.325,00:00:01.859,you're going to get rid of the tenx,
723,3,2,00:53:51.343,00:53:51.742,00:00:00.399,,so
724,3,2,00:53:52.447,00:53:55.140,00:00:02.693,,you probably want to subtract
725,3,2,00:54:01.399,00:54:11.030,00:00:09.631,yeah so then you get a hundred three equals pause filler negative one x,
726,3,2,00:54:29.122,00:54:32.294,00:00:03.172,,all right so then you want to multiply
727,3,2,00:54:32.895,00:54:35.300,00:00:02.405,we just try something out,
728,3,2,00:54:35.300,00:54:38.281,00:00:02.981,because if you multiply that by negative one x,
729,3,2,00:54:41.835,00:54:49.208,00:00:07.373,and then it would be negative one right over negative one x right,
730,3,2,00:54:51.543,00:54:53.594,00:00:02.051,and then you could cancel out the negative one,
731,3,2,00:54:56.442,00:55:00.054,00:00:03.612,,well if you see look at number nine on here
732,3,2,00:55:01.121,00:55:03.625,00:00:02.504,,this is like a really similar problem
733,3,2,00:55:03.625,00:55:05.471,00:00:01.846,,and you can kind of see what they're doing
734,3,2,00:55:05.990,00:55:06.951,00:00:00.961,,it's not really like
735,3,2,00:55:09.951,00:55:13.044,00:00:03.093,oh yes I mean it just seems like you would get rid of the step,
736,3,2,00:55:13.044,00:55:14.583,00:00:01.539,but really it's just do those stuff,
737,3,2,00:55:15.907,00:55:19.310,00:00:03.403,so you want to multiply by the x hundred and three,
738,3,2,00:55:19.310,00:55:23.111,00:00:03.801,and you get x equals one over (inaudible),
739,3,2,00:55:24.219,00:55:25.047,00:00:00.828,wait okay pause filler,
740,3,2,00:55:32.797,00:55:33.324,00:00:00.527,okay,
741,3,2,00:55:36.656,00:55:38.855,00:00:02.199,,well you still have to divide it by negative one
742,3,2,00:55:41.539,00:55:45.919,00:00:04.380,,so you multiply that on both sides and then pause filler
743,3,2,00:55:49.581,00:55:50.968,00:00:01.387,yeah actually you divide it,
744,3,2,00:55:50.968,00:55:54.679,00:00:03.711,then the step would be on the other side to just divide,
745,3,2,00:55:54.799,00:55:55.937,00:00:01.138,you get x by itself,
746,3,2,00:55:55.937,00:55:58.092,00:00:02.155,and you have to divide negative three by negative one,
747,3,2,00:55:59.099,00:56:00.000,00:00:00.901,,okay all right
748,3,2,00:56:02.237,00:56:03.030,00:00:00.793,pause filler but is that the same thing,
749,3,2,00:56:03.030,00:56:03.839,00:00:00.809,I don't think so pause filler,
750,3,2,00:56:05.969,00:56:06.650,00:00:00.681,,I doubt it
751,3,2,00:56:07.718,00:56:08.270,00:00:00.552,okay,
752,3,2,00:56:08.294,00:56:09.067,00:00:00.773,,all right so
753,3,2,00:56:13.527,00:56:14.110,00:00:00.583,,let's
754,3,2,00:56:19.881,00:56:24.258,00:00:04.377,,what's ninety what's one ninety there we go yeah
755,3,2,00:56:26.258,00:56:31.196,00:00:04.938,,and then I would want to yeah
756,3,2,00:56:31.306,00:56:33.411,00:00:02.105,,oh this is a big number pause filler
757,3,2,00:56:33.411,00:56:39.828,00:00:06.417,,so you got negative five over x equals
758,3,2,00:56:46.811,00:56:47.260,00:00:00.449,okay,
759,3,2,00:56:49.644,00:56:50.532,00:00:00.888,it's like really tiny,
760,3,2,00:56:51.321,00:56:53.196,00:00:01.875,I don't know,
761,3,2,00:56:53.316,00:56:57.726,00:00:04.410,I don't know what happened to it,
762,3,2,00:57:05.309,00:57:06.526,00:00:01.217,,all right
763,3,2,00:57:11.116,00:57:11.724,00:00:00.608,okay,
764,3,2,00:57:16.094,00:57:16.184,00:00:00.090,bye,
765,3,2,00:57:16.184,00:57:18.509,00:00:02.325,,all right
766,3,2,00:57:18.878,00:57:19.207,00:00:00.329,okay bye,
767,3,2,00:57:19.247,00:57:19.457,00:00:00.210,,bye
768,3,2,00:57:19.457,00:57:19.836,00:00:00.379,bye,
