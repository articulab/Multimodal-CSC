133,6,2,00:13:53.179,00:13:53.368,00:00:00.189,,yeah
134,6,2,00:13:53.718,00:13:56.681,00:00:02.963,are you guys doing like radicals and stuff cuz that's what we're doing,

149,6,2,00:15:09.450,00:15:14.710,00:00:05.260,,equals one hundred plus ten third x minus three times three equals one hundred thirty-three three hundred
150,6,2,00:15:14.710,00:15:17.750,00:00:03.040,,so hard to write with this thing
151,6,2,00:15:17.146,00:15:18.393,00:00:01.247,I know,

305,6,2,00:34:50.392,00:34:51.519,00:00:01.127,it's really bad,
306,6,2,00:34:51.609,00:34:54.802,00:00:03.193,yesterday I watched it into I watched two movies yesterday,
307,6,2,00:34:55.071,00:34:56.920,00:00:01.849,so this is why I'm very tired,
308,6,2,00:34:58.193,00:34:59.813,00:00:01.620,and got no sleep whatsoever,
309,6,2,00:34:59.990,00:35:02.193,00:00:02.203,but you know it's okay,
310,6,2,00:35:06.492,00:35:09.638,00:00:03.146,I've looked every time when I walked by the lake what is going on in that room,
311,6,2,00:35:09.638,00:35:12.641,00:00:03.003,or the child with bright red hair doing weird things,
312,6,2,00:35:15.737,00:35:17.261,00:00:01.524,the red ones are kind of okay,
313,6,2,00:35:18.448,00:35:21.511,00:00:03.063,,yeah but they all taste like really weird and like medicine
314,6,2,00:35:21.511,00:35:22.598,00:00:01.087,,but like a weird mecidine
315,6,2,00:35:22.802,00:35:24.803,00:00:02.001,it tastes like children's Tylenol,
316,6,2,00:35:25.193,00:35:25.422,00:00:00.229,,yeah
317,6,2,00:35:26.890,00:35:27.906,00:00:01.016,that's what they taste like,
318,6,2,00:35:27.906,00:35:32.220,00:00:04.314,that's why I don't like those because nobody likes children's Tylenol so,
319,6,2,00:35:32.007,00:35:32.705,00:00:00.698,,oh they're coming back
320,6,2,00:35:32.785,00:35:33.384,00:00:00.599,,woo
321,6,2,00:35:34.460,00:35:35.640,00:00:01.180,I guess she's coming back,
322,6,2,00:35:35.640,00:35:36.380,00:00:00.740,I don't see her,
323,6,2,00:35:36.627,00:35:43.913,00:00:07.286,the problem is the glass on this door it's like on the right so I can't see her cuz the hall's on the left (inaudible),
324,6,2,00:35:45.122,00:35:45.732,00:00:00.610,yeah sure,
325,6,2,00:35:53.027,00:35:53.387,00:00:00.360,okay,
326,6,2,00:35:56.572,00:35:58.980,00:00:02.408,this thing is going to take longer though,
327,6,2,00:35:59.819,00:36:00.113,00:00:00.294,yeah,
328,6,2,00:36:00.300,00:36:01.097,00:00:00.797,so I go back to the beginning,
329,6,2,00:36:02.510,00:36:03.052,00:00:00.542,thank you,
330,6,2,00:36:03.180,00:36:04.145,00:00:00.965,(inaudible),
331,6,2,00:36:05.976,00:36:07.024,00:00:01.048,all right,
332,6,2,00:36:08.275,00:36:13.500,00:00:05.225,let's times it by x that's right,
333,6,2,00:36:13.842,00:36:15.927,00:00:02.085,,she has to give me my pen
334,6,2,00:36:17.194,00:36:19.848,00:00:02.654,one equals twenty-five x,
335,6,2,00:36:19.848,00:36:25.303,00:00:05.455,one twenty fifth equals x ,
336,6,2,00:36:27.750,00:36:28.638,00:00:00.888,,that is great
337,6,2,00:36:30.752,00:36:32.085,00:00:01.333,that's called art,
338,6,2,00:36:32.867,00:36:33.339,00:00:00.472,(laughter),
339,6,2,00:36:34.545,00:36:38.767,00:00:04.222,  x and circle and well I don't know why I'm doing it,
340,6,2,00:36:38.880,00:36:40.232,00:00:01.352,oh wait mine's the wrong color hold on,
341,6,2,00:36:40.990,00:36:42.637,00:00:01.647,I was supposed to write on black right,
342,6,2,00:36:43.924,00:36:46.213,00:00:02.289,okay so negative three (inaudible),
343,6,2,00:36:48.306,00:36:50.786,00:00:02.480, okay let's start over cross it out ,
344,6,2,00:36:52.165,00:36:56.774,00:00:04.609,so sixty-three plus seventeen is nine eighty right,
345,6,2,00:36:57.922,00:37:02.950,00:00:05.028,negative three y equals eighty times y times y,
346,6,2,00:37:03.300,00:37:06.881,00:00:03.581,so negative three equals eighty y,
347,6,2,00:37:06.881,00:37:11.085,00:00:04.204,so negative three over eighty equals y,
348,6,2,00:37:12.319,00:37:12.549,00:00:00.230,,yup
349,6,2,00:37:13.647,00:37:13.920,00:00:00.273,okay,
350,6,2,00:37:15.512,00:37:17.807,00:00:02.295,and we subtract the fifty-four,
351,6,2,00:37:20.835,00:37:22.117,00:00:01.282,what would that be hold on,
352,6,2,00:37:22.117,00:37:23.414,00:00:01.297,,sixty-two
353,6,2,00:37:23.522,00:37:24.377,00:00:00.855,thank you,
354,6,2,00:37:25.312,00:37:26.590,00:00:01.278,four k,
355,6,2,00:37:27.980,00:37:29.350,00:00:01.370,okay I didn't mention any word,
356,6,2,00:37:30.102,00:37:31.101,00:00:00.999,sixty-two ,
357,6,2,00:37:32.277,00:37:35.420,00:00:03.143,times k times k,
358,6,2,00:37:35.905,00:37:44.436,00:00:08.531,four equals sixty-two k divide that by sixty two divided by sixty two over thirty-one,
359,6,2,00:37:44.745,00:37:49.564,00:00:04.819,,wait wouldn't it just oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
360,6,2,00:37:49.634,00:37:49.914,00:00:00.280,,sorry
361,6,2,00:37:51.201,00:37:51.769,00:00:00.568,,continue
362,6,2,00:37:51.473,00:37:52.387,00:00:00.914,ops,
363,6,2,00:37:52.893,00:37:55.487,00:00:02.594,oh wait I don't know I'm going to do that,
364,6,2,00:37:55.940,00:37:58.205,00:00:02.265,two hundred and ten y,
365,6,2,00:37:58.873,00:38:00.649,00:00:01.776,I still can't write with the mouse,
366,6,2,00:38:00.679,00:38:02.665,00:00:01.986,equals negative fourteen,
367,6,2,00:38:05.033,00:38:10.976,00:00:05.943,so that would be like seven one zero five,
368,6,2,00:38:12.941,00:38:13.739,00:00:00.798,,pause filler yeah
369,6,2,00:38:16.300,00:38:17.461,00:00:01.161,that's probably right,
370,6,2,00:38:17.461,00:38:18.090,00:00:00.629,who cares,
371,6,2,00:38:19.147,00:38:21.881,00:00:02.734,,pause filler okay what do you do first
372,6,2,00:38:22.031,00:38:24.156,00:00:02.125,well let's see here,
373,6,2,00:38:25.523,00:38:30.970,00:00:05.447,okay so I would add thirty-nine because I don't know it makes sense,
374,6,2,00:38:37.600,00:38:44.500,00:00:06.900,seventeen over x equals twelve over x,
375,6,2,00:38:37.605,00:38:37.805,00:00:00.200,,yeah
376,6,2,00:38:44.773,00:38:46.160,00:00:01.387,and then it be plus,
377,6,2,00:38:47.074,00:38:48.550,00:00:01.476,,eighteen I'm pretty sure
378,6,2,00:38:49.748,00:38:50.845,00:00:01.097,yeah eighteen,
379,6,2,00:38:50.845,00:38:52.072,00:00:01.227,you're right,
380,6,2,00:38:52.072,00:38:56.453,00:00:04.381,and then you multiply by x multiply by x,
381,6,2,00:38:56.847,00:39:04.253,00:00:07.406,and x times x is x squared equals twelve over x squared plus eighteen,
382,6,2,00:39:04.260,00:39:07.457,00:00:03.197,and then you got to multiply by x squared again to cancel out,
383,6,2,00:39:07.707,00:39:10.012,00:00:02.305,okay I did this in my homework the other day,
384,6,2,00:39:10.989,00:39:14.801,00:00:03.812,x squared equals twelve plus eighteen,
385,6,2,00:39:15.280,00:39:18.003,00:00:02.723,yup that's about the start you forget on this one right,
386,6,2,00:39:18.223,00:39:22.154,00:00:03.931,,yeah yeah yeah yeah
387,6,2,00:39:22.154,00:39:24.349,00:00:02.195,,I mean I'm not really sure
388,6,2,00:39:25.127,00:39:26.513,00:00:01.386,I'm bad at math,
389,6,2,00:39:26.744,00:39:27.622,00:00:00.878,,most kids maybe
390,6,2,00:39:29.607,00:39:30.555,00:00:00.948,I'm drawing a bow,
391,6,2,00:39:30.567,00:39:32.767,00:00:02.200,you know what I'm drawing bow,
392,6,2,00:39:33.000,00:39:34.606,00:00:01.606,,mm-hmm
393,6,2,00:39:34.567,00:39:39.813,00:00:05.246,okay plus ninety-two because we got to get rid of that negative right,
394,6,2,00:39:41.191,00:39:43.027,00:00:01.836,so then you get one zero three,
395,6,2,00:39:45.351,00:39:50.859,00:00:05.508,one zero three plus twelve x,
396,6,2,00:39:50.859,00:39:56.396,00:00:05.537,(inaudible) negative nine x equals one of three,
397,6,2,00:39:56.865,00:39:59.709,00:00:02.844,and negative (inaudible),
398,6,2,00:39:59.709,00:40:04.807,00:00:05.098,I don't know it's like eleven and four ninths,
399,6,2,00:40:06.324,00:40:08.030,00:00:01.706,,oh I'm seeing just like a bunch of random ys
400,6,2,00:40:08.030,00:40:08.658,00:00:00.628,,so I can't really (laugther)
401,6,2,00:40:09.113,00:40:10.747,00:00:01.634,yeah I know it's not writing,
402,6,2,00:40:11.033,00:40:13.437,00:00:02.404,,aside from what it says
403,6,2,00:40:14.276,00:40:15.104,00:00:00.828,it's not writing,
404,6,2,00:40:15.104,00:40:17.129,00:00:02.025,I don't know why I'm so annoyed,
405,6,2,00:40:18.286,00:40:23.960,00:00:05.674,awesome track what is it pause filler,
406,6,2,00:40:34.887,00:40:36.016,00:00:01.129,oh I'm going to play everything,
407,6,2,00:40:36.016,00:40:36.695,00:00:00.679,don't write yet,
408,6,2,00:40:36.944,00:40:37.453,00:00:00.509,,okay
409,6,2,00:40:38.291,00:40:41.913,00:00:03.622,so you would subtract twenty-five,
410,6,2,00:40:43.749,00:40:46.203,00:00:02.454,subtract twenty-five,
411,6,2,00:40:46.203,00:40:52.800,00:00:06.597,so you got one over x plus forty-five equals that,
412,6,2,00:40:52.847,00:40:53.947,00:00:01.100,,no it should be thirty-five
413,6,2,00:40:54.763,00:40:56.001,00:00:01.238,oh yup you're right,
414,6,2,00:40:56.001,00:40:56.929,00:00:00.928,you're right,
415,6,2,00:40:56.929,00:40:59.573,00:00:02.644,thank you tutor for math,
416,6,2,00:41:00.650,00:41:07.235,00:00:06.585,so I guess you could just really subtract one over x minus one over thirty-five equals eight over x,
417,6,2,00:41:07.235,00:41:11.326,00:00:04.091,then you get thirty-five x equals eight,
418,6,2,00:41:11.326,00:41:12.553,00:00:01.227,and then you get,
419,6,2,00:41:13.052,00:41:16.175,00:00:03.123,,x equals eight
420,6,2,00:41:16.175,00:41:18.579,00:00:02.404,eight thirty fifth,
421,6,2,00:41:19.886,00:41:20.196,00:00:00.310,,yeah
422,6,2,00:41:21.124,00:41:24.227,00:00:03.103,that's right because I don't even know,
423,6,2,00:41:24.805,00:41:27.669,00:00:02.864,,okay and then what do you do first
424,6,2,00:41:27.669,00:41:31.530,00:00:03.861,you add one ninety-two both sides,
425,6,2,00:41:31.530,00:41:39.442,00:00:07.912,this is the x equals scruples,
426,6,2,00:41:40.320,00:41:40.879,00:00:00.559,,wow
427,6,2,00:41:40.879,00:41:42.106,00:00:01.227,,pause filler that's really nice
428,6,2,00:41:44.467,00:41:47.973,00:00:03.506,I think that should be qualified as a legitimate answer,
429,6,2,00:41:52.607,00:41:55.545,00:00:02.938,all right and this is what happens when I'm tired,
430,6,2,00:41:56.134,00:41:57.980,00:00:01.846,,okay you add the one ninety
431,6,2,00:41:57.980,00:42:05.423,00:00:07.443,,and that equals like three hundred forty if you plan on doing that first yeah
432,6,2,00:42:06.710,00:42:11.307,00:00:04.597,and then negative fix x plus six x is x equals one x,
433,6,2,00:42:11.700,00:42:13.554,00:00:01.854,(inaudible) I don't even know (inaudible),
434,6,2,00:42:14.353,00:42:21.676,00:00:07.323,so then you get oh wait no you have to subtract this you get negative eleven x to this equals three hundred and forty,
435,6,2,00:42:21.676,00:42:25.627,00:00:03.951,and then you get negative eleven equals three hundred and forty x,
436,6,2,00:42:25.687,00:42:28.441,00:00:02.754,and you get eleven three hundred and forty x,
437,6,2,00:42:28.441,00:42:29.548,00:00:01.107,but it's negative,
438,6,2,00:42:29.817,00:42:30.366,00:00:00.549,there you go,
439,6,2,00:42:31.294,00:42:31.853,00:00:00.559,,beauty
440,6,2,00:42:31.853,00:42:33.220,00:00:01.367,stop come on,
441,6,2,00:42:33.220,00:42:35.385,00:00:02.165,can I go get them so we can,
442,6,2,00:42:35.385,00:42:36.502,00:00:01.117,,they just skip ahead
443,6,2,00:42:36.502,00:42:38.067,00:00:01.565,,so I think we can just keep on going
444,6,2,00:42:38.527,00:42:41.307,00:00:02.780,okay let me see how much time we have left,
445,6,2,00:42:42.440,00:42:45.153,00:00:02.713,for nineteen minutes until we get to finish,
446,6,2,00:42:45.378,00:42:47.337,00:00:01.959,well let's draw I'm drawing (sfx),
447,6,2,00:42:59.702,00:43:02.054,00:00:02.352,let's see who can fill up the page first,
448,6,2,00:43:07.459,00:43:09.892,00:00:02.433,I can't see any of your writing,
449,6,2,00:43:16.002,00:43:16.142,00:00:00.140,,okay
450,6,2,00:43:25.591,00:43:25.810,00:00:00.219,,yeah
451,6,2,00:43:26.635,00:43:28.446,00:00:01.811,at five thirty-two,
452,6,2,00:43:28.843,00:43:29.991,00:00:01.148,,at five thirty-two
453,6,2,00:43:30.759,00:43:31.986,00:00:01.227,,okay so wait
454,6,2,00:43:33.121,00:43:35.729,00:00:02.608,we have like nineteen minutes-ish,
455,6,2,00:43:36.237,00:43:39.818,00:00:03.581,,okay like I say give us twenty-five minutes to do pause filler
456,6,2,00:43:42.333,00:43:47.042,00:00:04.709,,so I like five fifty-seven they should come and get us
457,6,2,00:43:47.042,00:43:50.953,00:00:03.911,,so that's how much longer we have
458,6,2,00:43:52.968,00:43:55.343,00:00:02.375,,boom let's go
459,6,2,00:43:57.029,00:43:57.119,00:00:00.090,,math (sfx)
460,6,2,00:43:57.432,00:44:00.554,00:00:03.122,I'm so (inaudible),
461,6,2,00:44:01.486,00:44:03.283,00:00:01.797,they say I'm sewing a lot,
462,6,2,00:44:05.420,00:44:06.697,00:00:01.277,,okay what you do
463,6,2,00:44:06.697,00:44:07.835,00:00:01.138,,you just drive twenty
464,6,2,00:44:07.835,00:44:08.513,00:00:00.678,,woo yeah
465,6,2,00:44:15.513,00:44:17.513,00:00:02.000,no that's a good handwriting,
466,6,2,00:44:17.702,00:44:18.141,00:00:00.439,,yeah (laughter)
467,6,2,00:44:19.378,00:44:23.432,00:00:04.054,I'm just moving on because the answer is negative eight over three x,
468,6,2,00:44:23.432,00:44:25.604,00:00:02.172,and I can tell you that just from looking at it,
469,6,2,00:44:26.632,00:44:27.171,00:00:00.539,,one
470,6,2,00:44:28.175,00:44:29.365,00:00:01.190,oh wait I want to skip one,
471,6,2,00:44:30.662,00:44:34.094,00:00:03.432,x plus thirty-eight how do you,
472,6,2,00:44:34.567,00:44:37.756,00:00:03.189,so first of all you got to multiply it by x plus thirty,
473,6,2,00:44:37.756,00:44:38.770,00:00:01.014,cancel it out,
474,6,2,00:44:39.034,00:44:39.293,00:00:00.259,,yeah
475,6,2,00:44:40.716,00:44:44.810,00:00:04.094,so that would be negative two equals seventy-three,
476,6,2,00:44:45.260,00:44:48.473,00:00:03.213,you could distribute with that some kind of boring,
477,6,2,00:44:53.648,00:44:59.837,00:00:06.189,negative forty equals seventy-three x I'm going to do it on seventy-three,
478,6,2,00:44:59.837,00:45:01.000,00:00:01.163,and here is your answer,
479,6,2,00:45:08.636,00:45:10.800,00:00:02.164,all right let's go to the next problem,
480,6,2,00:45:11.866,00:45:12.297,00:00:00.431,,okay 
481,6,2,00:45:17.902,00:45:18.528,00:00:00.626,,so I guess 
482,6,2,00:45:22.420,00:45:27.644,00:00:05.224,,you multiply it by negative x minus one to cancel out 
483,6,2,00:45:31.000,00:45:38.430,00:00:07.430,,hmm
484,6,2,00:45:34.040,00:45:37.405,00:00:03.365,this is also my first week back at school so I'm kinda dead,
485,6,2,00:45:39.459,00:45:40.946,00:00:01.487,just what we could go back,
486,6,2,00:45:41.751,00:45:44.834,00:00:03.083,,my spring break was like in the middle of March or something
487,6,2,00:45:45.702,00:45:47.418,00:00:01.716,,so it was like four weeks ago
488,6,2,00:45:48.486,00:45:52.148,00:00:03.662,mine was like three weeks long because there was a debate thing (inaudible),
489,6,2,00:45:52.243,00:45:56.148,00:00:03.905,but it wasn't even intentional the computer did that,
490,6,2,00:45:56.737,00:46:01.635,00:00:04.898,kind of like love each other you know,
491,6,2,00:46:02.756,00:46:04.108,00:00:01.352,I love to figure out how to do this,
492,6,2,00:46:04.121,00:46:06.156,00:00:02.035,you shouldn't let homework I'll just like skip this problem,
493,6,2,00:46:06.156,00:46:08.500,00:00:02.344,and be like I'll do it later,
494,6,2,00:46:09.310,00:46:11.392,00:00:02.082,and then never do it (inaudible),
495,6,2,00:46:10.586,00:46:15.455,00:00:04.869,,okay so well then there would be like you didn't do your work
496,6,2,00:46:15.534,00:46:18.797,00:00:03.263,,you're such a fail zero now huh and then
497,6,2,00:46:18.797,00:46:21.689,00:00:02.892,my teacher don't even care anymore she used to,
498,6,2,00:46:21.689,00:46:25.462,00:00:03.773,but not like oh well I guess I'll give you an a anyway,
499,6,2,00:46:25.000,00:46:32.739,00:00:07.739,,(inaudible)
500,6,2,00:46:25.921,00:46:28.770,00:00:02.849,there I'm just kidding,
501,6,2,00:46:29.608,00:46:31.788,00:00:02.180,I'm still too confused,
502,6,2,00:46:31.788,00:46:34.711,00:00:02.923,out of hundred seventy-seven,
503,6,2,00:46:34.950,00:46:49.008,00:00:14.058,so we get ten over x equals two hundred and ninety-five plus one hundred is three hundred and ninety-five equals seventy is four hundred and sixty five plus seven is four hundred and seventy-two,
504,6,2,00:46:51.824,00:46:52.865,00:00:01.041,over x,
505,6,2,00:46:53.119,00:46:57.689,00:00:04.570,so then you just got to like yeah that's the answer,
506,6,2,00:46:59.804,00:47:04.433,00:00:04.629,,oh well oh well let's just let's just forget about that one
507,6,2,00:47:04.643,00:47:08.554,00:00:03.911,we just did this you just cleared the page,
508,6,2,00:47:13.892,00:47:17.486,00:00:03.594,I don't know what I'm drawing I just feel like drawing,
509,6,2,00:47:19.500,00:47:22.256,00:00:02.756,I'm just trying to kill time so we don't have to do all of them,
510,6,2,00:47:24.013,00:47:25.675,00:00:01.662,this sounds like me on my homework,
511,6,2,00:47:25.675,00:47:27.905,00:00:02.230,and then she always goes over in class,
512,6,2,00:47:27.905,00:47:29.459,00:00:01.554,so like if you didn't do it,
513,6,2,00:47:29.459,00:47:30.946,00:00:01.487,you're really not that screwed,
514,6,2,00:47:32.351,00:47:34.914,00:00:02.563,I also like (inaudible) she looks for her like that,
515,6,2,00:47:34.914,00:47:37.568,00:00:02.654,,I feel kind of bad (laughter) (inaudible)
516,6,2,00:47:46.486,00:47:50.919,00:00:04.433,well this is what happens when you put two thirteen year olds on FaceTime,
517,6,2,00:47:50.919,00:47:52.837,00:00:01.918,and to talk about class,
518,6,2,00:47:51.327,00:47:52.394,00:00:01.067,,and make them do math yeah
519,6,2,00:47:53.013,00:47:55.202,00:00:02.189,because they end up talking about other things,
520,6,2,00:47:54.659,00:47:56.365,00:00:01.706,,and we have like little pens
521,6,2,00:47:56.365,00:47:57.932,00:00:01.567,,like I can't just not doodle
522,6,2,00:47:59.689,00:48:00.925,00:00:01.236,I doddle on everything,
523,6,2,00:48:01.054,00:48:03.067,00:00:02.013,oh she's (inaudible),
524,6,2,00:48:04.608,00:48:06.000,00:00:01.392,oh what I'm drawing,
525,6,2,00:48:06.000,00:48:09.000,00:00:03.000,(sfx),
526,6,2,00:48:09.865,00:48:14.215,00:00:04.350,,these are also like complicated
527,6,2,00:48:14.215,00:48:20.041,00:00:05.826,,do you know what time it is
528,6,2,00:48:21.000,00:48:21.256,00:00:00.256,yeah,
529,6,2,00:48:21.309,00:48:23.675,00:00:02.366,amazing we can do as soon as we finish,
530,6,2,00:48:23.973,00:48:24.900,00:00:00.927,I'm kidding,
531,6,2,00:48:24.973,00:48:27.446,00:00:02.473,that's five forty-seven,
532,6,2,00:48:27.485,00:48:29.743,00:00:02.258,I feel like they're going to use this data and be like,
533,6,2,00:48:30.000,00:48:38.310,00:00:08.310,so a lot of the students did them all exactly because they also because we put two thirteen years olds who wouldn't do work in a group,
534,6,2,00:48:38.310,00:48:44.486,00:00:06.176,and it didn't go over well because there's a problem if you invented an app the kids would probably become friends,
535,6,2,00:48:46.671,00:48:46.880,00:00:00.209,,yeah
536,6,2,00:48:47.932,00:48:49.540,00:00:01.608,I mean that's true,
537,6,2,00:48:49.594,00:48:50.911,00:00:01.317,,okay so we have ten minutes
538,6,2,00:48:50.911,00:48:52.528,00:00:01.617,,we have to kill ten minutes
539,6,2,00:48:52.558,00:48:55.182,00:00:02.624,,and then we can be free from this math do
540,6,2,00:48:55.182,00:48:57.716,00:00:02.534,oh no they're going to make us do that survey again right,
541,6,2,00:48:58.454,00:48:58.564,00:00:00.110,,oh
542,6,2,00:48:59.442,00:49:09.810,00:00:10.368,ninety-two minus twenty seven is sixty-four plus nine over two x plus nine equals two x plus nine,
543,6,2,00:49:09.810,00:49:11.500,00:00:01.690,and then the answer is seven,
544,6,2,00:49:11.694,00:49:13.148,00:00:01.454,I'm guessing x is seven,
545,6,2,00:49:13.162,00:49:14.202,00:00:01.040,and I'm probably right yikes,
546,6,2,00:49:16.403,00:49:18.359,00:00:01.956,,I have no idea what you can (inaudible)
547,6,2,00:49:18.359,00:49:21.242,00:00:02.883,,it's going to make assume it's right
548,6,2,00:49:21.242,00:49:23.966,00:00:02.724,everything I do is definitely right,
549,6,2,00:49:26.189,00:49:28.351,00:00:02.162,my shirt is like a (inaudible) on the inside,
550,6,2,00:49:28.351,00:49:30.716,00:00:02.365,and then just like wonderful sleeve,
551,6,2,00:49:33.189,00:49:34.865,00:00:01.676,and then like miserable (inaudible),
552,6,2,00:49:33.674,00:49:38.174,00:00:04.500,,I'm sitting like in a conference room
553,6,2,00:49:38.563,00:49:41.437,00:00:02.874,,oh my god
554,6,2,00:49:38.783,00:49:39.729,00:00:00.946,(inaudible),
555,6,2,00:49:41.437,00:49:42.604,00:00:01.167,,that's so nice
556,6,2,00:49:43.310,00:49:45.594,00:00:02.284,I just want to go sit in it,

569,6,2,00:50:21.013,00:50:26.702,00:00:05.689,(sfx) oh I have to write a history essay two by May six (inaudible),
570,6,2,00:50:25.367,00:50:29.218,00:00:03.851,,isn't May six like a month away
571,6,2,00:50:30.202,00:50:33.000,00:00:02.798,May six is a very important day in history,
572,6,2,00:50:37.589,00:50:43.865,00:00:06.276,I'm writing about how the art how World War II affected the arts,
573,6,2,00:50:43.865,00:50:47.826,00:00:03.961,and then just like I think I'm smart for the idea,
574,6,2,00:50:47.826,00:50:50.865,00:00:03.039,but I'm also really annoyed by the idea you know,
575,6,2,00:50:50.959,00:50:51.278,00:00:00.319,,yeah
576,6,2,00:50:51.946,00:50:58.092,00:00:06.146,because it's like I only did research on one part because I'm writing about Captain America for a mass section of it,
577,6,2,00:50:58.362,00:50:59.489,00:00:01.127,,Captain America
578,6,2,00:51:00.178,00:51:02.594,00:00:02.416,comic started in the fortys,
579,6,2,00:51:02.594,00:51:06.164,00:00:03.570,and gave children help blah blah blah that definitely supports my thesis,
580,6,2,00:51:06.164,00:51:06.593,00:00:00.429,,that's so cool
581,6,2,00:51:06.593,00:51:09.081,00:00:02.488,blah blah blah (inaudible),
582,6,2,00:51:07.651,00:51:09.666,00:00:02.015,,I don't know that's cool
583,6,2,00:51:09.756,00:51:11.986,00:00:02.230,those cancel each other out,
584,6,2,00:51:12.716,00:51:15.500,00:00:02.784,so then you don't have any xs so it's undefined,
585,6,2,00:51:17.243,00:51:19.554,00:00:02.311,algebra yeah,
586,6,2,00:51:21.329,00:51:26.824,00:00:05.495,and then I'm writing about portraits and political cartoons for the other two,
587,6,2,00:51:26.228,00:51:28.493,00:00:02.265,,oh that's sounds interesting
588,6,2,00:51:29.081,00:51:30.946,00:00:01.865,that's probably going to end up a really long answer,
589,6,2,00:51:31.135,00:51:32.648,00:00:01.513,I mean I don't hate writing essay,
590,6,2,00:51:32.648,00:51:34.067,00:00:01.419,I just don't want to do the research part,
591,6,2,00:51:34.889,00:51:36.295,00:00:01.406,like the last meeting,
592,6,2,00:51:36.295,00:51:37.692,00:00:01.397,I'm a writing person,
593,6,2,00:51:37.692,00:51:38.860,00:00:01.168,I'm not a math person,
594,6,2,00:51:40.466,00:51:44.547,00:00:04.081,what kind of science do you take next year,
595,6,2,00:51:45.225,00:51:48.139,00:00:02.914,,pause filler like physics or something

597,6,2,00:51:51.878,00:51:52.756,00:00:00.878,that's terrible,
598,6,2,00:51:52.798,00:51:56.370,00:00:03.572,,I think like the first year of Winchester because now I was looking there for high school
599,6,2,00:51:56.729,00:51:59.563,00:00:02.834,,we have to take physics as well the first year
600,6,2,00:51:59.563,00:52:00.820,00:00:01.257,,or maybe it's biology
601,6,2,00:52:00.820,00:52:01.458,00:00:00.638,,I'm not sure
602,6,2,00:52:01.458,00:52:03.486,00:00:02.028,oh it's physics wait are you going there,
603,6,2,00:52:04.841,00:52:05.858,00:00:01.017,,I was considering
604,6,2,00:52:05.858,00:52:08.871,00:00:03.013,,but I think going Ellis
605,6,2,00:52:07.878,00:52:09.567,00:00:01.689,did you get accepted at Winchester,
606,6,2,00:52:12.862,00:52:12.982,00:00:00.120,,yeah
607,6,2,00:52:13.594,00:52:15.243,00:00:01.649,but Ellis is all girls,
608,6,2,00:52:15.243,00:52:16.297,00:00:01.054,that's sad,
609,6,2,00:52:16.354,00:52:19.148,00:00:02.794,,I know I'm kind of not looking for it
610,6,2,00:52:19.148,00:52:21.852,00:00:02.704,,but it's like a nice place I guess pause filler

629,6,2,00:53:13.265,00:53:17.346,00:00:04.081,,I know I think it's like whenever you're a senior you don't have to wear uniform
630,6,2,00:53:17.720,00:53:20.360,00:00:02.640,at Winchester it's like we have a dress code,
631,6,2,00:53:20.360,00:53:22.250,00:00:01.890,but we don't care if you follow it,
632,6,2,00:53:22.614,00:53:24.659,00:00:02.045,,yeah it's like get to those business casual
633,6,2,00:53:24.659,00:53:25.218,00:00:00.559,,but I don't think any

635,6,2,00:53:29.269,00:53:33.400,00:00:04.131,it's like I want to actually care it's what I guess it's nice don't you think,
636,6,2,00:53:36.622,00:53:36.712,00:00:00.090,,yeah
637,6,2,00:53:37.251,00:53:46.610,00:00:09.359,I mean like I'm so sick of (inaudible) that it's like you have to dress nice like I was wearing this sweatshirt and it's a Michigan on it,
638,6,2,00:53:46.610,00:53:49.240,00:00:02.630,and I got yelled that it was a school colors it's like,
639,6,2,00:53:49.134,00:53:50.301,00:00:01.167,,I see you don't have the uniform

641,6,2,00:53:52.556,00:53:52.975,00:00:00.419,,oh
642,6,2,00:53:53.350,00:54:00.920,00:00:07.570,we have to wear solid-colored skirts that go down to at least the knees or solid-colored pants or solid-colored shorts,
643,6,2,00:54:00.920,00:54:02.840,00:00:01.920,but nobody wear shorts really except the boys,
644,6,2,00:54:03.270,00:54:06.000,00:00:02.730,and then we'd have to wear shoes as long as clothes are towed,
645,6,2,00:54:06.000,00:54:07.262,00:00:01.262,and it doesn't matter what our socks are,
646,6,2,00:54:07.482,00:54:11.762,00:00:04.280,so wear any solid-colored shirt colored shirt,
647,6,2,00:54:11.762,00:54:13.210,00:00:01.448,and our sweatshirts have to say (inaudible),
648,6,2,00:54:13.210,00:54:14.920,00:00:01.710,and it can have a hood on them,
649,6,2,00:54:15.244,00:54:17.310,00:00:02.066,,that is kind of strict
650,6,2,00:54:15.590,00:54:20.010,00:00:04.420,and sweaters they changed the rule every day,
651,6,2,00:54:20.240,00:54:22.960,00:00:02.720,some days are like oh it's okay that your sweater is multicolored,
652,6,2,00:54:22.960,00:54:24.922,00:00:01.962,and somebody say like you have to take that up,
653,6,2,00:54:24.922,00:54:26.568,00:00:01.646,or I'm giving you detention,
654,6,2,00:54:26.938,00:54:27.666,00:00:00.728,,oh wow
655,6,2,00:54:29.020,00:54:32.170,00:00:03.150,like if I were against the school just like a black Star Wars voucher,
656,6,2,00:54:32.170,00:54:33.350,00:00:01.180,I would get yelled at,
657,6,2,00:54:33.872,00:54:34.660,00:00:00.788,,that sucks
658,6,2,00:54:35.540,00:54:36.865,00:00:01.325,it's really warm,
659,6,2,00:54:36.566,00:54:38.312,00:00:01.746,,the school I go to now Folk
660,6,2,00:54:38.402,00:54:40.597,00:00:02.195,,it's like no uniform
661,6,2,00:54:38.779,00:54:39.644,00:00:00.865,yeah they're,
662,6,2,00:54:40.666,00:54:41.774,00:00:01.108,,not many rules
663,6,2,00:54:41.774,00:54:44.358,00:00:02.584,,there's no such thing as detention (laughter) so
664,6,2,00:54:45.256,00:54:46.919,00:00:01.663,I've never actually got detention,
665,6,2,00:54:46.932,00:54:51.094,00:00:04.162,like I'm shocked that Winchester accepted me because I've gotten so many points,
666,6,2,00:54:51.189,00:54:52.560,00:00:01.371,like I haven't gotten detention,
667,6,2,00:54:52.560,00:54:54.392,00:00:01.832,but I got points which kind of lead up to detention,
668,6,2,00:54:54.986,00:55:02.432,00:00:07.446,and I'm also bad and I get really bad grades so I don't understand how they will accept me,
669,6,2,00:55:03.944,00:55:09.301,00:00:05.357,,yeah I might like after two years at Ellis my parents will like me switch schools
670,6,2,00:55:09.301,00:55:10.549,00:00:01.248,,so I might go to Winchester
671,6,2,00:55:11.270,00:55:12.300,00:00:01.030,that would be nice,
672,6,2,00:55:12.300,00:55:14.013,00:00:01.713,so then I'd have another friend,
673,6,2,00:55:14.013,00:55:16.216,00:00:02.203,I only know one person going who I like,
674,6,2,00:55:16.216,00:55:18.486,00:00:02.270,"so, no, two people going who I like",
