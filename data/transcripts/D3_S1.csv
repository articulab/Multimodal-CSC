00:04:02.780,00:04:05.790,00:00:03.010,,"so like what I do is before I started erasing the problem",,
00:04:06.300,00:04:08.460,00:00:02.160,,"so I think I'm just going to have to rewrite that problem",,
00:04:10.224,00:04:13.650,00:00:03.426,,"and that did okay adjacent pencil",,
00:04:14.400,00:04:22.765,00:00:08.365,,"let's see three plus x equals twenty-two",,
00:04:23.387,00:04:23.750,00:00:00.363,,,"all right",
00:04:27.580,00:04:31.340,00:00:03.760,,"so I assume you probably know how to solve this one",,

00:04:38.580,00:04:46.640,00:00:08.060,,"so I guess umm you need to get x on leave only a thing on one side",,
00:04:46.811,00:04:48.570,00:00:01.759,,"so you're going to have to get rid of three",,
00:04:49.006,00:04:51.996,00:00:02.990,,,"yeah so would you have to subtract three from both sides",
00:04:52.637,00:04:55.466,00:00:02.829,,"umm yeah so can you do it on there",,
00:04:55.880,00:04:56.174,00:00:00.294,,,"yeah",

00:05:05.370,00:05:10.580,00:00:05.210,,,"so then you're just left with x equals",
00:05:12.590,00:05:14.178,00:00:01.588,,,,"all right thanks for your patience"
00:05:14.218,00:05:14.398,00:00:00.180,,,"huh",

00:07:36.020,00:07:44.960,00:00:08.940,,"okay so umm as we're doing equal so I wonder if I can circle all right here",,
00:07:48.230,00:07:48.880,00:00:00.650,,"done huh",,
00:07:49.880,00:07:50.810,00:00:00.930,,"yeah you're going to have to get rid of that six",,
00:07:51.640,00:07:54.200,00:00:02.560,,,"yeah so you would have to add six right",
00:07:54.940,00:07:57.920,00:00:02.980,,"yeah so do you want to add six to both of those sides",,
00:08:00.332,00:08:01.190,00:00:00.858,,,"oh gosh (laughter)",
00:08:01.760,00:08:03.940,00:00:02.180,,"I know this writing with this stuff is so weird",,
00:08:04.490,00:08:08.320,00:00:03.830,,,"so you add six and then you get x equals nineteen",
00:08:09.600,00:08:10.160,00:00:00.560,,,"oh gosh",
00:08:15.140,00:08:16.940,00:00:01.800,,"so okay",,

00:08:19.630,00:08:22.550,00:00:02.920,,"but do you know how to get to the next problem",,
00:08:23.912,00:08:27.430,00:00:03.518,,,"yeah we go onto the next page",
00:08:27.750,00:08:36.150,00:00:08.400,,"oh okay pause filler okay for this one it's sort of the same thing so you want to get or does the eight",,
00:08:36.775,00:08:38.950,00:00:02.175,,,"yeah and that's a negative so you would have to add it",
00:08:39.529,00:08:41.170,00:00:01.641,,"yeah just like the last one",,
00:08:49.410,00:08:50.410,00:00:01.000,,,"oh gosh",
00:08:56.730,00:08:58.990,00:00:02.260,,"okay that was it not bad",,
00:08:59.480,00:09:05.140,00:00:05.660,,,"fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two",
00:09:09.580,00:09:11.460,00:00:01.880,,,"all right next page right",
00:09:13.461,00:09:14.260,00:00:00.799,,"yup there we go",,
00:09:16.158,00:09:22.440,00:00:06.282,,"okay pause filler so this one is a lot like the other ones except for this one yeah you don't want to add it",,
00:09:23.050,00:09:24.630,00:00:01.580,,,"yeah so you have to subtract",
00:09:25.690,00:09:31.850,00:00:06.160,,,"so you would subtract eleven because it's a positive right",
00:09:32.081,00:09:32.370,00:00:00.289,,"yeah",,
00:09:32.950,00:09:34.500,00:00:01.550,,,"all right so minus eleven",
00:09:42.428,00:09:45.380,00:00:02.952,,,"then those who cancel out so it would be k equals six",
00:09:45.940,00:09:46.160,00:00:00.220,,"yeah",,
00:09:47.940,00:09:50.320,00:00:02.380,,,"oh gosh this is so messy",
00:09:56.900,00:10:06.372,00:00:09.472,,"okay so this time we yeah only one term on the other side so yeah",,
00:10:07.241,00:10:11.241,00:00:04.000,,"so you want to get rid of the forty-four so the coefficient of x is one",,
00:10:12.150,00:10:12.560,00:00:00.410,,"so",,
00:10:12.150,00:10:12.570,00:00:00.420,,,"yeah",
00:10:15.420,00:10:16.360,00:00:00.940,,"do you know how to do that",,
00:10:16.460,00:10:23.800,00:00:07.340,,,"yeah yeah yeah yeah so you'd have to divide because it's multiplication then you do the opposites so divided by forty",
00:10:23.370,00:10:23.529,00:00:00.159,,"yeah",,
00:10:25.100,00:10:26.770,00:00:01.670,,,"it's so weird because I have to like",
00:10:27.940,00:10:34.340,00:00:06.400,,,"I have to take a moment to think now because I'm so accustomed in my class to using calculators like she lets us",
00:10:34.375,00:10:35.910,00:00:01.535,,"I know yeah",,
00:10:36.570,00:10:37.080,00:00:00.510,,,"so divide it",
00:10:37.720,00:10:39.670,00:00:01.950,,"on personal calculators and I just pull it up",,
00:10:40.050,00:10:40.570,00:00:00.520,,,"yeah",
00:10:42.157,00:10:47.997,00:00:05.840,,,"wait oh gosh is this what even what even is this then",
00:10:52.800,00:10:53.240,00:00:00.440,,,"ten",
00:10:55.230,00:10:56.290,00:00:01.060,,,"x equals",
00:10:58.375,00:11:01.700,00:00:03.325,,,"twenty-two divided two hundred and twenty divided by forty-four",
00:11:03.670,00:11:04.400,00:00:00.730,,"yeah I wonder if I could",,
00:11:05.478,00:11:09.110,00:00:03.632,,"umm so that's like a forty-four on that side",,
00:11:09.419,00:11:11.110,00:00:01.691,,"that was lovely okay I know what I mean",,
00:11:11.910,00:11:13.210,00:00:01.300,,"and two hundred twenty",,
00:11:14.515,00:11:17.180,00:00:02.665,,"see you can go I see like umm",,
00:11:18.472,00:11:19.480,00:00:01.008,,,"yeah yeah yeah yeah",
00:11:19.929,00:11:25.850,00:00:05.921,,"I just yeah okay how many times it's like about five five ten",,
00:11:26.610,00:11:28.150,00:00:01.540,,,"oh yeah that would make sense so",
00:11:28.220,00:11:29.600,00:00:01.380,,"and maybe it's five",,
00:11:29.775,00:11:30.410,00:00:00.635,,,"yeah it",
00:11:36.150,00:11:38.097,00:00:01.947,,"that was not how it's supposed to",,
00:11:38.167,00:11:41.800,00:00:03.633,,,"it seems so embarrassing because it's just like we're so used to using calculators but it just",
00:11:42.548,00:11:42.990,00:00:00.442,,,"yeah",
00:11:43.660,00:11:46.720,00:00:03.060,,"okay let's see that's zero",,
00:11:47.980,00:11:50.733,00:00:02.753,,"it's a two yeah a two",,
00:11:51.353,00:11:53.790,00:00:02.437,,"four times that that's also yeah it's five",,
00:11:55.230,00:11:55.930,00:00:00.700,,,"all right great",
00:11:58.600,00:12:02.860,00:00:04.260,,,"so are you an advanced then because you're an algebra in the seventh grade",
00:12:04.060,00:12:10.890,00:00:06.830,,"umm yes so what I'm doing at the moment I'm taking a full year of algebra one but at the same time I'm also taking geometry",,
00:12:11.130,00:12:11.813,00:00:00.683,,,"oh god",
00:12:12.330,00:12:12.860,00:00:00.530,,"yeah so",,
00:12:12.870,00:12:17.870,00:00:05.000,,,"like I I'm not in like there's like three levels of math",
00:12:17.985,00:12:21.080,00:00:03.095,,,"there's like the low math who don't like get as quickly",
00:12:21.109,00:12:22.590,00:00:01.481,,,"there isjust like the regular math",
00:12:23.016,00:12:24.870,00:00:01.854,,,"and then there's the advanced math",
00:12:25.260,00:12:26.723,00:00:01.463,,,"I'm in just like the regular math",
00:12:27.277,00:12:29.820,00:00:02.543,,,"and I'm like right where I should be in my grade",
00:12:30.197,00:12:34.150,00:00:03.953,,,"and English is more my subject like I'm in advanced English all the time but",
00:12:34.858,00:12:36.868,00:00:02.010,,,"math it's all right I just",
00:12:38.608,00:12:39.280,00:00:00.672,,"yeah so",,
00:12:39.550,00:12:41.690,00:00:02.140,,,"all right so now you add",
00:12:44.385,00:12:45.465,00:00:01.080,,,"you add nine right",
00:12:45.820,00:12:46.044,00:00:00.224,,"yeah",,
00:12:46.320,00:12:46.890,00:00:00.570,,,"so",
00:12:50.621,00:12:52.020,00:00:01.399,,,"so you add nine to this",
00:12:53.155,00:12:58.830,00:00:05.675,,,"and then you're left with thirteen p equals fifty",
00:13:02.140,00:13:02.743,00:00:00.603,,,"so",
00:13:05.080,00:13:07.375,00:00:02.295,,"so then you want to give it to the thirteen",,
00:13:08.105,00:13:09.790,00:00:01.685,,,"so you divide it by thirteen",
00:13:13.020,00:13:15.360,00:00:02.340,,,"wait does the fraction umm",
00:13:17.535,00:13:21.060,00:00:03.525,,,"does the fifty divided by thirteen equal out to a fraction",
00:13:21.870,00:13:25.067,00:00:03.197,,"no I don't think it's simplified I think it's just fifty over thirteen",,
00:13:25.320,00:13:26.000,00:00:00.680,,,"all right great",
00:13:29.341,00:13:32.250,00:00:02.909,,,"I thought that it could've been a simplified fraction I was not sure",
00:13:32.520,00:13:37.260,00:00:04.740,,"I mean like thirteen is like prime numbers so it would not be that likely",,
00:13:37.626,00:13:38.000,00:00:00.374,,,"yeah",
00:13:38.850,00:13:43.379,00:00:04.529,,,"so with this one it's a little bit different but you just subtract ten",
00:13:44.800,00:13:45.700,00:00:00.900,,,"from both sides",
00:13:47.030,00:13:47.160,00:00:00.130,,"yup",,
00:13:47.890,00:13:48.460,00:00:00.570,,,"so",
00:13:49.392,00:13:50.312,00:00:00.920,,,"twenty four",
00:13:52.810,00:13:53.731,00:00:00.921,,,"and umm",
00:13:55.136,00:13:56.996,00:00:01.860,,,"so you are left with six x",
00:13:57.460,00:13:58.120,00:00:00.660,,,"equals",
00:13:58.790,00:14:00.805,00:00:02.015,,,"twenty-four so then you divide by",
00:14:01.330,00:14:05.152,00:00:03.822,,,"sorry I'm getting over a cold so that's why I sound",
00:14:05.800,00:14:06.260,00:00:00.460,,"yeah a six",,
00:14:08.045,00:14:12.540,00:00:04.495,,,"divided by six and then x equals four because twenty-four divided by six equals four",
00:14:14.440,00:14:15.631,00:00:01.191,,"oh your equals signs are getting better",,
00:14:16.571,00:14:17.440,00:00:00.869,,,"yeah",
00:14:18.876,00:14:20.490,00:00:01.614,,"okay next one",,
00:14:21.570,00:14:22.570,00:00:01.000,,,"all right so",
00:14:25.500,00:14:26.430,00:00:00.930,,,"with this one",
00:14:27.350,00:14:29.768,00:00:02.418,,,"since that's a negative you add it right so",
00:14:30.384,00:14:30.754,00:00:00.370,,"yeah",,
00:14:40.100,00:14:40.460,00:00:00.360,,,"oh okay",
00:14:43.420,00:14:44.340,00:00:00.920,,,"oh my gosh",
00:14:46.960,00:14:47.340,00:00:00.380,,,"so",
00:14:48.550,00:14:49.360,00:00:00.810,,,"that would equal",
00:14:52.860,00:14:54.120,00:00:01.260,,,"sixty-two",
00:14:54.550,00:14:55.260,00:00:00.710,,,"equals",
00:14:55.740,00:14:56.580,00:00:00.840,,,"fifteen",
00:14:57.300,00:14:58.845,00:00:01.545,,,"k oh my god",
00:14:59.410,00:14:59.900,00:00:00.490,,,"umm",
00:15:00.590,00:15:01.120,00:00:00.530,,,"and then",
00:15:01.950,00:15:03.600,00:00:01.650,,,"divide that by fifteen",
00:15:06.700,00:15:08.110,00:00:01.410,,,"so that would just be another",
00:15:08.743,00:15:11.946,00:00:03.203,,"let's see where were we sixty-two divisible by three nope",,
00:15:14.249,00:15:16.950,00:00:02.701,,"I'd say that no you can't simplify it",,
00:15:17.314,00:15:18.320,00:00:01.006,,"it maybe maybe not",,
00:15:24.350,00:15:25.910,00:00:01.560,,"yeah because yeah",,
00:15:26.008,00:15:26.458,00:00:00.450,,,"all right",
00:15:28.250,00:15:28.780,00:00:00.530,,,"so",
00:15:30.860,00:15:31.861,00:00:01.001,,,"for this one",
00:15:34.920,00:15:35.270,00:00:00.350,,,"subtract",
00:15:35.350,00:15:35.710,00:00:00.360,,"yeah",,
00:15:36.635,00:15:37.055,00:00:00.420,,"twelve",,
00:15:47.142,00:15:50.560,00:00:03.418,,,"sorry it's like it takes a minute for it to show up",
00:15:51.560,00:15:53.200,00:00:01.640,,"yeah real slow",,
00:15:54.155,00:15:54.595,00:00:00.440,,"okay",,
00:16:07.080,00:16:08.560,00:00:01.480,,"so yeah twenty one",,
00:16:08.860,00:16:09.130,00:00:00.270,,"that's right",,
00:16:10.380,00:16:12.859,00:00:02.479,,,"so then that cancels out obviously",
00:16:13.119,00:16:13.519,00:00:00.400,,"yeah",,
00:16:13.944,00:16:14.734,00:00:00.790,,,"so plus",
00:16:16.390,00:16:18.224,00:00:01.834,,,"oh no that equals twenty one",
00:16:19.454,00:16:20.487,00:00:01.033,,,"equals seven x",
00:16:21.217,00:16:21.707,00:00:00.490,,,"and then",
00:16:22.080,00:16:23.940,00:00:01.860,,,"twenty-one is divisible by seven so",
00:16:24.745,00:16:25.115,00:00:00.370,,"yeah",,
00:16:25.700,00:16:28.952,00:00:03.252,,,"so that's umm divisible by three so then umm",
00:16:29.670,00:16:31.189,00:00:01.519,,,"x equals three",
00:16:32.569,00:16:33.389,00:00:00.820,,"yup okay",,
00:16:36.950,00:16:39.820,00:00:02.870,,,"all right great oh so this is a different one",
00:16:40.540,00:16:45.540,00:00:05.000,,,"so first you're going to get to pause filler you're going to do the variables first",
00:16:46.310,00:16:48.860,00:00:02.550,,,"and then you do the one that's like less right",
00:16:49.068,00:16:52.670,00:00:03.602,,"yeah you do the less because otherwise you'll have the negative p and that's not that fun",,
00:16:52.900,00:16:53.220,00:00:00.320,,,"yeah",
00:16:53.818,00:16:56.670,00:00:02.852,,,"so minus p and then minus p",
00:16:57.384,00:17:00.040,00:00:02.656,,,"so you end up with fifteen equals",
00:17:00.460,00:17:00.910,00:00:00.450,,,"oh gosh",
00:17:01.790,00:17:02.160,00:00:00.370,,,"got it",
00:17:05.060,00:17:08.180,00:00:03.120,,,"umm fifteen sorry umm fifteen equals two p",
00:17:09.170,00:17:10.040,00:00:00.870,,,"plus twelve",
00:17:12.177,00:17:12.296,00:00:00.119,,"yeah",,
00:17:12.475,00:17:13.400,00:00:00.925,,,"so then umm",
00:17:13.732,00:17:14.790,00:00:01.058,,"it's just like the other problems",,
00:17:14.925,00:17:16.510,00:00:01.585,,,"yeah now you subtract twelve",
00:17:18.560,00:17:19.060,00:00:00.500,,,"so",
00:17:19.640,00:17:20.710,00:00:01.070,,,"three equals",
00:17:21.250,00:17:21.700,00:00:00.450,,,"oh god",
00:17:23.410,00:17:23.820,00:00:00.410,,,"two",
00:17:24.500,00:17:24.870,00:00:00.370,,,"p",
00:17:26.330,00:17:26.940,00:00:00.610,,,"no",
00:17:27.940,00:17:31.980,00:00:04.040,,,"no you divide it by two so you end up with three halves",
00:17:34.160,00:17:36.670,00:00:02.510,,"yeah so because you can't simplify that anymore",,
00:17:36.710,00:17:37.090,00:00:00.380,,,"yeah",
00:17:45.150,00:17:45.730,00:00:00.580,,,"all right",
00:17:46.259,00:17:46.720,00:00:00.461,,"okay so for this one",,
00:17:46.720,00:17:48.190,00:00:01.470,,"so for this one",,
00:17:48.810,00:17:52.140,00:00:03.330,,"yeah you want to start off by having only one k",,
00:17:55.210,00:17:55.700,00:00:00.490,,,"so",
00:17:56.640,00:17:59.190,00:00:02.550,,,"you have to subtract that anyway",
00:18:00.010,00:18:00.770,00:00:00.760,,,"subtract",
00:18:02.832,00:18:07.142,00:00:04.310,,,"that from this so you would end up with negative ten because you leave the negative there",
00:18:07.409,00:18:08.087,00:00:00.678,,"yeah",,
00:18:07.420,00:18:08.090,00:00:00.670,,,"equals",
00:18:09.180,00:18:10.670,00:00:01.490,,,"seven k",
00:18:13.450,00:18:14.960,00:00:01.510,,,"minus sixty-eight",
00:18:16.840,00:18:17.260,00:00:00.420,,,"then",
00:18:17.837,00:18:21.400,00:00:03.563,,,"then plus ten on both sides",
00:18:21.400,00:18:21.800,00:00:00.400,,,"plus",
00:18:22.920,00:18:24.460,00:00:01.540,,,"ten on both sides",
00:18:25.230,00:18:31.243,00:00:06.013,,"umm no actually you wouldn't want to do the plus ten because then you'll have seven k equals yeah so",,
00:18:31.630,00:18:32.250,00:00:00.620,,,"you add sixty-eight",
00:18:32.630,00:18:32.750,00:00:00.120,,"yup",,
00:18:33.790,00:18:35.800,00:00:02.010,,,"I'm just going to write over it you know what",
00:18:37.910,00:18:39.180,00:00:01.270,,,"so plus sixty-eight",
00:18:39.860,00:18:40.920,00:00:01.060,,,"so that cancels out",
00:18:41.550,00:18:41.940,00:00:00.390,,,"then",
00:18:44.710,00:18:45.600,00:00:00.890,,,"seventy-eight",
00:18:48.630,00:18:49.330,00:00:00.700,,,"equals",
00:18:49.655,00:18:51.650,00:00:01.995,,,"equals seven k",
00:18:51.650,00:18:52.320,00:00:00.670,,,"seven",
00:18:52.920,00:18:55.103,00:00:02.183,,,"k wait is seventy-eight divided by seven",
00:18:55.623,00:18:56.893,00:00:01.270,,,"divisible by seven I mean",
00:18:57.023,00:19:05.700,00:00:08.677,,"wait no I think you messed up because that's a negative ten so it wouldn't be ten plus sixty it would be ten minus it would be sixty-eight minus ten",,
00:19:06.000,00:19:06.865,00:00:00.865,,,"oh",
00:19:06.910,00:19:07.300,00:00:00.390,,"yeah",,
00:19:07.890,00:19:08.340,00:00:00.450,,"so",,
00:19:08.440,00:19:09.440,00:00:01.000,,,"it would be fifty-eight",
00:19:11.370,00:19:17.700,00:00:06.330,,,"so fifty-eight equals seven k so is fifty-eight divisible by a seven I can't talk I'm sorry umm",
00:19:18.080,00:19:18.760,00:00:00.680,,"umm",,
00:19:19.350,00:19:22.380,00:00:03.030,,"I don't think though because I don't remember that fifty six is",,
00:19:23.060,00:19:24.030,00:00:00.970,,"fifty-eight isn't",,
00:19:24.410,00:19:25.020,00:00:00.610,,,"okay great",
00:19:26.190,00:19:26.770,00:00:00.580,,"so",,

00:20:54.940,00:20:57.531,00:00:02.591,,,"let's just start with the variables so you subtract",
00:20:58.660,00:21:00.360,00:00:01.700,,,"you subtract r",
00:21:01.000,00:21:05.490,00:00:04.490,,,"so then you would just end up with r  because you don't say one r because it's all yeah",
00:21:05.820,00:21:06.050,00:00:00.230,,"yeah",,
00:21:06.300,00:21:08.350,00:00:02.050,,,"so you keep the negative thirty-three",
00:21:09.570,00:21:10.396,00:00:00.826,,,"equals",

00:22:31.178,00:22:32.018,00:00:00.840,,,"equals",

00:22:45.249,00:22:46.990,00:00:01.741,,"oh that's fun underlining stuff",,
00:22:49.524,00:22:50.094,00:00:00.570,,,"so",
00:22:50.820,00:22:52.730,00:00:01.910,,,"then you subtract eight from this",
00:22:53.190,00:22:55.190,00:00:02.000,,,"so since it's a negative you would base",
00:22:56.422,00:22:56.942,00:00:00.520,,,"yeah you",
00:22:58.097,00:22:58.947,00:00:00.850,,,"I'm just thinking of",
00:23:00.000,00:23:01.900,00:00:01.900,,"yes so it would still be a negative",,

00:23:03.410,00:23:07.350,00:00:03.940,,,"oh so yeah it would still be a negative so you're basically just adding it but it's a negative",
00:23:08.025,00:23:08.205,00:00:00.180,,"yeah",,
00:23:08.240,00:23:08.710,00:00:00.470,,,"kind of",

00:23:14.740,00:23:16.760,00:00:02.020,,,"equals three u",
00:23:17.225,00:23:17.685,00:00:00.460,,,"and then",
00:23:18.150,00:23:20.300,00:00:02.150,,,"and then fifty isn't divisible by three",
00:23:20.670,00:23:21.140,00:00:00.470,,"no",,
00:23:21.350,00:23:23.912,00:00:02.562,,,"so just divide it by three",
00:23:24.520,00:23:26.370,00:00:01.850,,,"and then u equals",
00:23:27.640,00:23:28.770,00:00:01.130,,,"oh fifty",
00:23:29.127,00:23:29.927,00:00:00.800,,,"over three",
00:23:35.440,00:23:35.930,00:00:00.490,,,"all right",
00:23:37.430,00:23:38.170,00:00:00.740,,,"so",

00:23:50.548,00:23:50.968,00:00:00.420,,,"umm",

00:24:00.270,00:24:01.050,00:00:00.780,,,"equals",

00:24:17.279,00:24:17.799,00:00:00.520,,,"so",
00:24:18.230,00:24:22.490,00:00:04.260,,,"so you that you end up with ninety-nine on this side also so ninety-nine equals",

00:24:23.120,00:24:27.540,00:00:04.420,,,"ninety-nine and then obviously that divides into one so",
00:24:28.475,00:24:29.890,00:00:01.415,,,"n equals one",
00:24:30.297,00:24:31.780,00:00:01.483,,,"that was an easy problem",

00:24:40.610,00:24:41.750,00:00:01.140,,,"all right great so",
00:24:42.230,00:24:44.970,00:00:02.740,,,"so you subtract g this time because it's",
00:24:45.495,00:24:45.815,00:00:00.320,,"yeah",,
00:24:47.140,00:24:48.350,00:00:01.210,,"so that will lessen",,

00:40:15.359,00:40:15.773,00:00:00.414,,,"because",
00:40:16.066,00:40:17.253,00:00:01.187,,,"so I just wrote over there",

00:40:18.386,00:40:19.960,00:00:01.574,,,"you should start off by adding b because",

00:40:42.560,00:40:49.378,00:00:06.818,,"so now we need to make sure the b is on only one side and to do that you have to subtract the thirteen",,
00:40:49.746,00:40:50.026,00:00:00.280,,,"right",
00:40:50.880,00:40:51.773,00:00:00.893,,"not the seventeen",,
00:40:53.146,00:40:54.106,00:00:00.960,,"and you get",,
00:40:54.733,00:40:57.368,00:00:02.635,,"four equals two b",,
00:40:57.910,00:40:59.750,00:00:01.840,,"and then you wnat to divide the two",,

00:41:04.573,00:41:06.213,00:00:01.640,,"and b equals two",,

00:45:26.950,00:45:31.865,00:00:04.915,,"so I guess you want to so that would be nine p so you want to add the p yeah",,
00:45:32.653,00:45:36.307,00:00:03.654,,"so if you do it to both sides we got the negative fifty-two here",,

00:45:55.613,00:46:00.856,00:00:05.243,,"which happens to be fourteen that would be",,
00:46:01.667,00:46:01.907,00:00:00.240,,"forty",,
