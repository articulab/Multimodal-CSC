00:22:02.287,00:22:04.901,00:00:02.614,,,,"so then what did you get m equals what",
00:22:05.400,00:22:07.416,00:00:02.016,,,"negative two",,
00:22:07.416,00:22:08.663,00:00:01.247,,,,"that's what I got",
00:22:08.753,00:22:10.359,00:00:01.606,,,,"so it's probably right",

00:22:22.132,00:22:25.644,00:00:03.512,,,"so you have negative seven y equals",,
00:22:25.644,00:22:26.692,00:00:01.048,,,"add the eleven",,

00:22:35.530,00:22:38.994,00:00:03.464,,,,"oh what was really really not that hard okay",
00:22:39.533,00:22:42.900,00:00:03.367,,,,"so I would personally subtract the nineteen first",

00:25:02.119,00:25:06.908,00:00:04.789,,,"so I started by subtracting the twenty-eight d from the fifty-three",,
00:25:06.908,00:25:21.205,00:00:14.297,,,"so fifty-three minus twenty-eight equals twenty-five right",,
00:25:21.205,00:25:25.835,00:00:04.630,,,"and then you have twenty-five d",,

00:25:56.250,00:26:04.750,00:00:08.500,,,"and then d equals negative fifty-one twenty-five",,
00:26:06.053,00:26:11.112,00:00:05.059,,,"or that equals negative two one",,
00:26:12.469,00:26:13.417,00:00:00.948,,,"that�s what I got",,

00:36:13.812,00:36:18.062,00:00:04.250,,,,"and then you have to divide out by a negative one",
00:36:18.062,00:36:19.349,00:00:01.287,,,,"because there's a negative",
00:36:21.715,00:36:22.692,00:00:00.977,,,,"and then you get y",
00:36:22.871,00:36:30.474,00:00:07.603,,,,"there's a negative five okay next one",
00:36:25.300,00:36:27.125,00:00:01.825,,,"wooo yeah",,
00:36:30.474,00:36:36.810,00:00:06.336,,,,"pause filler I'm going to change the color so we're like not the same color",

00:36:36.910,00:36:38.436,00:00:01.526,,,,"but I don�t like that color",

00:36:44.033,00:36:46.598,00:00:02.565,,,,"okay I know I wasn�t supposed to change the color",
00:36:46.598,00:36:49.002,00:00:02.404,,,,"but you know what I'm a rebel in this study",
00:36:49.002,00:36:49.690,00:00:00.688,,,"you're such a rebel",,
00:36:50.199,00:36:54.090,00:00:03.891,,,,"such a rebel let's so then you have to add fourteen",
00:36:54.090,00:37:00.905,00:00:06.815,,,,"so you get negative k equals fifty plus k wait oh my",
00:37:00.985,00:37:02.302,00:00:01.317,,,,"and then you subtract k",
00:37:02.302,00:37:03.719,00:00:01.417,,,,"and then you subtract k again",
00:37:04.038,00:37:06.901,00:00:02.863,,,,"so you get negative two k equals fifty",
00:37:06.901,00:37:09.037,00:00:02.136,,,,"and then you just divide out by a negative two",
00:37:09.037,00:37:09.276,00:00:00.239,,,"two yeah",,
00:37:09.276,00:37:14.823,00:00:05.547,,,,"and then k is negative twenty-five whoa like math",
00:37:15.180,00:37:15.382,00:00:00.202,,,"whoo",,
00:37:16.198,00:37:18.425,00:00:02.227,,,,"I have twenty two problems to do outside",
00:37:18.425,00:37:20.221,00:00:01.796,,,,"and I'm going to add b",
00:37:21.119,00:37:21.339,00:00:00.220,,,"okay",,
00:37:22.346,00:37:24.362,00:00:02.016,,,,"so you get seventeen",
00:37:26.607,00:37:29.520,00:00:02.913,,,,"seventeen equals thirteen plus two b",
00:37:29.520,00:37:34.638,00:00:05.118,,,,"I'm showing on equal sign here equals",
00:37:34.688,00:37:37.671,00:00:02.983,,,,"what the what the why why why do you do this to me",
00:37:37.671,00:37:40.724,00:00:03.053,,,,"and then four equals two b",
00:37:40.724,00:37:41.742,00:00:01.018,,,,"divide by out two",
00:37:41.962,00:37:43.269,00:00:01.307,,,,"and divide out by two",

00:49:55.018,00:50:05.900,00:00:10.882,,,,"forty-two forty-one yup forty-one y plus thirty-seven minus thirty-seven y you add the thirty-seven just to subtract it",
00:50:07.627,00:50:08.661,00:00:01.034,,,"okay pause filler",,
00:50:09.563,00:50:15.918,00:00:06.355,,,,"so that would be twelve equals forty-one y",
00:50:17.645,00:50:21.454,00:00:03.809,,,,"and then you just get twelve forty-first equals one",
00:50:23.027,00:50:23.305,00:00:00.278,,,,"oop",
00:50:26.200,00:50:27.891,00:00:01.691,,,"oh this has so many numbers",,
00:50:29.372,00:50:32.636,00:00:03.264,,,,"oh math in general",
00:50:34.200,00:50:35.827,00:00:01.627,,,,"why can I oh there we go",
00:50:39.491,00:50:43.354,00:00:03.863,,,,"okay I guess I'll start with subtracting sixty-one",
00:50:45.845,00:50:46.354,00:00:00.509,,,"okay",,
00:50:47.645,00:50:56.391,00:00:08.746,,,,"so then you would get two hundred and six minus thirty-three z",
00:50:57.927,00:51:03.609,00:00:05.682,,,,"ah this reminds me of like writing calligraphy because you have to (inaudible)",
00:51:03.972,00:51:05.336,00:00:01.364,,,,"so that would be",
00:51:08.809,00:51:14.645,00:00:05.836,,,,"sixty-seven two hundred and sixty-seven equals one",
00:51:15.427,00:51:18.805,00:00:03.378,,,,"oh my god one hundred and thirty-four z divide out",
00:51:19.481,00:51:20.871,00:00:01.390,,,,"divide out long story shorter",
00:51:20.871,00:51:24.672,00:00:03.801,,,,"it ends up being like two or something right I don�t",
00:51:24.683,00:51:27.164,00:00:02.481,,,"pause filler wait let's",,
00:51:27.176,00:51:31.596,00:00:04.420,,,,"yeah or no it would be like one and one hundred something",
00:51:33.518,00:51:36.909,00:00:03.391,,,,"okay now that's a lot of numbers",
00:51:39.345,00:51:42.821,00:00:03.476,,,,"pause filler I don't know what I'm doing",
00:51:43.236,00:51:47.991,00:00:04.755,,,"well you could start by subtracting the fifty",,
00:51:49.218,00:51:52.509,00:00:03.291,,,"or adding these",,
00:51:53.609,00:51:54.327,00:00:00.718,,,,"or I'll subtract",
00:51:54.491,00:51:56.191,00:00:01.700,,,,"yeah that�s a good idea thank you",
00:51:56.300,00:52:04.809,00:00:08.509,,,,"negative sixty p minus one hundred and forty equals negative fifteen p plus fifty",
00:52:05.218,00:52:10.527,00:00:05.309,,,,"so then you can add forty to both side one forty thank you one forty to both sides",
00:52:10.536,00:52:16.554,00:00:06.018,,,,"so then you get negative sixty p equals negative fifteen p plus",
00:52:18.000,00:52:22.872,00:00:04.872,,,,"ninety ninety no one hundred and ninety ps",
00:52:25.181,00:52:28.746,00:00:03.565,,,,"and then add fifteen p so then you get seventy negative ",
00:52:30.354,00:52:31.063,00:00:00.709,,,,"no wait",
00:52:32.127,00:52:33.873,00:00:01.746,,,,"wait just fix up you get",
00:52:34.818,00:52:38.963,00:00:04.145,,,,"negative forty-five p equals one hundred and ninety",
00:52:38.963,00:52:42.900,00:00:03.937,,,,"and then divide out by forty-five and by forty-five",
00:52:45.400,00:52:48.409,00:00:03.009,,,,"forty I want to say forty-five times like ",
00:52:50.999,00:52:52.759,00:00:01.760,,,"pause filler",,
00:52:52.745,00:52:56.791,00:00:04.046,,,,"four no not four",
00:52:56.791,00:52:57.381,00:00:00.590,,,,"maybe",
00:52:58.700,00:53:02.281,00:00:03.581,,,"wait so you have negative forty-five r equals a hundred ninety and then",,
00:53:02.463,00:53:11.636,00:00:09.173,,,,"so actually you get four and two ninths negative four and two ninths equals r",
00:53:27.536,00:53:30.551,00:00:03.015,,,,"(sfx)",
00:53:30.527,00:53:33.109,00:00:02.582,,,"okay I guess we should go to the next",,
00:53:34.281,00:53:35.772,00:00:01.491,,,,"hey we only have one more",
00:53:37.691,00:53:40.300,00:00:02.609,,,,"did you find that I feel like you had twenty-three problems",

00:53:51.545,00:53:54.127,00:00:02.582,,,,"either I'm really fast at math or I'm doing it wrong",
00:53:55.336,00:53:56.509,00:00:01.173,,,"no you're going pretty fast",,
00:53:57.436,00:53:59.100,00:00:01.664,,,,"I guess it's because I did this already",
00:54:08.554,00:54:10.818,00:00:02.264,,,,"oh it's so hard to read your own handwriting on this thing",

00:54:26.927,00:54:32.272,00:00:05.345,,,,"no one hundred and fifty-five equals or no",
00:54:32.381,00:54:34.827,00:00:02.446,,,,"well I added the five so it would be one hundred and sixty",
00:54:38.109,00:54:42.763,00:00:04.654,,,,"equals fifty y and then divide out by fifty divide out by fifty",
00:54:42.763,00:54:44.681,00:00:01.918,,,,"and then you get three and",
00:54:45.800,00:54:46.554,00:00:00.754,,,,"one well",
