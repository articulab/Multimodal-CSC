00:09:52.550,00:09:56.750,00:00:04.200,,"just remember to make sure that you aren't solving the problems yourself ",,,,
00:09:56.760,00:10:00.250,00:00:03.490,,"just use the stylus to circle or underline if you need to solve the problems ",,,,
00:10:00.940,00:10:05.925,00:00:04.985,,"no pressure if you can't get through them all and so if you can go ahead and get started",,,,
00:10:05.925,00:10:07.641,00:00:01.716,,,"so there's one on every page",,,
00:10:07.641,00:10:08.210,00:00:00.569,,"yes",,,,
00:10:08.300,00:10:11.732,00:00:03.432,,,"so I just go to there to go to the next problem",,,
00:10:11.772,00:10:12.032,00:00:00.260,,"yeah",,,,
00:10:12.032,00:10:14.227,00:00:02.195,,,"and they work they do the problem",,,
00:10:14.316,00:10:16.662,00:00:02.346,,"yeah and you can like talk to each other about the problems",,,,
00:10:16.900,00:10:20.171,00:00:03.271,,"and you can put your headphones back on and then when I come back (inaudible) you can just take them off and can you (inaudible)",,,,

00:11:44.542,00:11:45.768,00:00:01.226,,,"you can start",,,
00:11:45.888,00:12:00.904,00:00:15.016,,,,,"okay so pause filler all right this thing's weird to control pause filler",
00:12:25.029,00:12:29.679,00:00:04.650,,,,,"so is this how pause filler to start the equation",
00:12:37.518,00:12:39.696,00:00:02.178,,,"yeah so then the sixes cancel out",,,
00:12:39.925,00:12:40.065,00:00:00.140,,,,,"yeah",
00:12:40.115,00:12:42.230,00:00:02.115,,,"and then you add thirteen to six",,,
00:12:42.809,00:12:47.259,00:00:04.450,,,,,"yeah okay so you get x equals pause filler nineteen",
00:12:47.000,00:12:48.000,00:00:01.000,,,"pause filler",,,
00:12:53.737,00:12:57.236,00:00:03.499,,,,,"all right so fifteen equals negative eight plus p",
00:13:00.026,00:13:01.047,00:00:01.021,,,,,"so you have fifteen",
00:13:02.315,00:13:03.422,00:00:01.107,,,,,"and then you add eight",
00:13:03.422,00:13:06.984,00:00:03.562,,,,,"because you undo the eights correct okay",
00:13:07.054,00:13:07.283,00:00:00.229,,,"yeah",,,
00:13:20.861,00:13:22.399,00:00:01.538,,,,,"and so the eights cancel out",
00:13:22.688,00:13:24.105,00:00:01.417,,,,,"and then you get fifteen plus eight",
00:13:24.324,00:13:29.832,00:00:05.508,,,,,"pause filler you get twenty-three",
00:13:31.159,00:13:31.378,00:00:00.219,,,"yeah",,,
00:13:31.688,00:13:44.229,00:00:12.541,,,,,"equals p okay all right so this problem works the same as everything else",
00:13:44.898,00:13:45.227,00:00:00.329,,,"pause filler yeah",,,
00:13:45.227,00:13:50.834,00:00:05.607,,,,,"okay so you use thirteen minus eleven",
00:14:00.901,00:14:05.571,00:00:04.670,,,,,"seventeen minus eleven is six equals k",
00:14:16.027,00:14:20.108,00:00:04.081,,,,,"so for this problem you would divide out the forty-four",
00:14:20.477,00:14:20.796,00:00:00.319,,,"yeah",,,
00:14:20.980,00:14:21.360,00:00:00.380,,,,,"okay",
00:14:32.580,00:14:35.440,00:00:02.860,,,,"two twenty divided by fourty four is",,
00:14:53.786,00:14:56.000,00:00:02.214,,,,,"forty-five so",
00:15:00.900,00:15:05.584,00:00:04.684,,,,,"I have five because twenty two hundred twenty divided by forty-four is five",
00:15:06.203,00:15:06.542,00:00:00.339,,,"yeah",,,
00:15:11.870,00:15:13.579,00:00:01.709,,,,,"negative nine plus thirteen p ",
00:15:46.350,00:15:47.070,00:00:00.720,,,,,"fifty",
00:15:47.938,00:15:48.547,00:00:00.609,,,"fifty",,,
00:15:48.826,00:15:55.266,00:00:06.440,,,,,"yeah so p equals fifty thirteenths ",
00:16:23.849,00:16:38.543,00:00:14.694,,,,,"twenty twenty-four over six over six equals pause filler four okay",
00:17:10.200,00:17:13.603,00:00:03.403,,,,,"forty plus twenty-two is sixty-two",
00:17:12.000,00:17:13.000,00:00:01.000,,,"pause filler",,,
00:17:24.000,00:17:31.000,00:00:07.000,,,,,"yeah sixty-two fifteenths equals k ",
00:18:13.690,00:18:14.140,00:00:00.450,,,,,"yeah",
00:18:14.417,00:18:15.173,00:00:00.756,,,"yeah that's right",,,
00:18:15.403,00:18:18.985,00:00:03.582,,,,,"okay so they pretty much follow the same rules of just going",
00:18:19.783,00:18:20.122,00:00:00.339,,,"yeah",,,
00:18:20.242,00:18:20.608,00:00:00.366,,,,,"yeah all right so",
00:18:25.310,00:18:26.190,00:00:00.880,,,,,"alright so",
00:18:27.456,00:18:34.120,00:00:06.664,,,"okay so what you do is you subtract this p",,,
00:18:34.819,00:18:35.228,00:00:00.409,,,,,"pause filler okay",
00:18:35.487,00:18:36.854,00:00:01.367,,,"pause filler from this p",,,
00:18:37.084,00:18:39.957,00:00:02.873,,,,,"okay so you want all the variables on one side",
00:18:39.957,00:18:41.400,00:00:01.443,,,,,"and then you get the equation",
00:18:59.173,00:18:59.364,00:00:00.191,,,,,"nope",
00:19:06.530,00:19:11.720,00:00:05.190,,,,,"so you get fifteen equals four p",
00:19:12.932,00:19:16.194,00:00:03.262,,,"one two p because you're subtracting",,,
00:19:15.820,00:19:16.750,00:00:00.930,,,,,"oh okay thank you",
00:19:24.542,00:19:26.391,00:00:01.849,,,,,"three because you subtract twelve",
00:19:27.230,00:19:35.271,00:00:08.041,,,,,"and then you get three equals two p or one-point-five equals p",
00:19:36.798,00:19:37.267,00:00:00.469,,,"yup",,,
00:19:42.066,00:19:43.822,00:00:01.756,,,,,"you get pause filler k",
00:19:43.822,00:19:48.222,00:00:04.400,,,,,"you'd subtract the k to get seven k",
00:19:49.050,00:19:49.240,00:00:00.190,,,"no",,,
00:19:50.068,00:19:50.247,00:00:00.179,,,,,"right",
00:19:50.247,00:19:53.430,00:00:03.183,,,"this the eight k would become the seven k",,,
00:19:53.550,00:19:56.363,00:00:02.813,,,,,"yeah and that equals ten",
00:19:57.132,00:19:57.471,00:00:00.339,,,"yeah",,,
00:19:57.621,00:20:00.594,00:00:02.973,,,,,"negative ten negative ten because there's a subtraction sign there",
00:20:00.993,00:20:03.936,00:00:02.943,,,,,"then you add the sixty-eight to get",
00:20:04.695,00:20:09.005,00:00:04.310,,,,,"pause filler seven k equals seventy-eight",
00:20:10.412,00:20:17.635,00:00:07.223,,,,,"and then you get k equals pause filler seventy-eight sevenths",
00:20:20.571,00:20:22.664,00:00:02.093,,,,,"that may or may not be reducible",
00:20:22.664,00:20:24.579,00:00:01.915,,,,,"but that is the answer",
00:20:24.968,00:20:25.348,00:00:00.380,,,"yeah",,,
00:20:29.588,00:20:30.240,00:00:00.652,,,,,"okay",

00:21:44.568,00:21:47.032,00:00:02.464,,,,,"all right so you have pause filler",
00:21:47.381,00:21:50.384,00:00:03.003,,,,,"you subtract the r",
00:21:50.384,00:21:52.619,00:00:02.235,,,,,"pause filler so you're left with one r",
00:21:52.619,00:22:00.242,00:00:07.623,,,,,"so you get negative thirty-three equals pause filler r minus fifteen",
00:22:00.841,00:22:03.275,00:00:02.434,,,,,"you add fifteen to both sides",
00:22:05.041,00:22:12.000,00:00:06.959,,,,,"so you get pause filler negative thirty-three plus fifteen is negative twenty pause filler eighteen",
00:22:16.075,00:22:17.236,00:00:01.161,,,,,"you have eighteen",
00:22:20.636,00:22:20.994,00:00:00.358,,,"yes",,,
00:22:21.050,00:22:23.480,00:00:02.430,,,,,"okay so yeah negative fifteen equals r",

00:22:30.849,00:22:33.796,00:00:02.947,,,"okay so it's the same thing",,,
00:22:34.235,00:22:37.557,00:00:03.322,,,,,"yeah okay so you subtract u",
00:22:37.886,00:22:47.435,00:00:09.549,,,,,"and you get negative forty-two equals eight plus three u",
00:22:48.935,00:22:53.680,00:00:04.745,,,,,"and then you get equals then you get",

00:23:08.437,00:23:17.200,00:00:08.763,,,,,"and you get negative fifty thirds equals u ",
00:23:20.930,00:23:22.880,00:00:01.950,,,,,"okay just larger numbers",
00:23:25.418,00:23:26.466,00:00:01.048,,,,,"so you subtract the n",
00:23:26.715,00:23:28.172,00:00:01.457,,,,,"you get ninety-nine n",
00:23:28.172,00:23:39.397,00:00:11.225,,,,,"so you get one hundred six equals pause filler ninety-nine n plus seven n seven",
00:23:40.883,00:23:42.978,00:00:02.095,,,,,"and you subtract seven",
00:23:42.978,00:23:47.139,00:00:04.161,,,,,"and you get ninety-nine n equals ninety nine",
00:23:50.102,00:23:54.089,00:00:03.987,,,,,"so you get n equals one one ",

00:25:53.971,00:25:54.929,00:00:00.958,,,,,"it would be a nicer number",
00:25:54.929,00:25:56.236,00:00:01.307,,,,,"so you subtract the twenty-eight",

00:27:03.692,00:27:09.828,00:00:06.136,,,,,"pause filler it's probably easier to do if you subtract the nine",

00:27:14.188,00:27:22.486,00:00:08.298,,,,,"you get one hundred two equals fifty-three pause filler plus ten x",
00:27:27.970,00:27:39.471,00:00:11.501,,,,,"so pause filler one hundred two minus fifty-three is fifty-two minus three is forty-nine equals ten x",
00:27:40.050,00:27:44.680,00:00:04.630,,,,,"so you get pause filler forty four-point-nine equals x ",

00:27:51.510,00:27:55.754,00:00:04.244,,,,,"thirteen y plus twenty-seven pause filler it's easier to just subtract that y",
00:27:57.252,00:28:07.577,00:00:10.325,,,,,"so you get twelve y plus twenty-seven equals negative seventy-three",
00:28:09.652,00:28:11.608,00:00:01.956,,,,,"so you subtract the twenty-seven",
