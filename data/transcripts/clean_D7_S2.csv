24,7,2,00:01:45.700,00:01:49.500,00:00:03.800,one thing I know is this is going to be very complicating,
25,7,2,00:01:50.800,00:01:56.300,00:00:05.500,,yeah because you have the packet right
26,7,2,00:01:57.900,00:01:58.270,00:00:00.370,,yeah
27,7,2,00:02:04.000,00:02:06.510,00:00:02.510,,those are like the best like flute
28,7,2,00:02:12.000,00:02:16.300,00:00:04.300,I wonder what it would be like with Donald Trump running the country,
29,7,2,00:02:19.000,00:02:20.900,00:00:01.900,,I would move
30,7,2,00:02:20.900,00:02:25.800,00:00:04.900,yeah but I mean like other people have to stay to like make things right,
31,7,2,00:02:26.400,00:02:32.200,00:00:05.800,like I actually asked my parents my mom like are we going to move if Donald Trump becomes president,
32,7,2,00:02:32.200,00:02:34.600,00:00:02.400,and she's like no yeah where are we going to stay,
33,7,2,00:02:34.600,00:02:36.700,00:00:02.100,because this is our country,
34,7,2,00:02:36.700,00:02:39.400,00:00:02.700,and like yeah so,
35,7,2,00:02:39.500,00:02:43.600,00:00:04.100,,yeah my friend she said she asked her mom
36,7,2,00:02:43.600,00:02:45.900,00:00:02.300,,she's like would we move if Donald Trump becomes president
37,7,2,00:02:45.900,00:02:48.900,00:00:03.000,,and her mom like since she has family that lived overseas
38,7,2,00:02:48.900,00:02:51.700,00:00:02.800,,her mom is like we would be moving all the way back to France
39,7,2,00:02:51.700,00:02:54.500,00:00:02.800,,like she was not joking
40,7,2,00:02:54.500,00:02:57.600,00:00:03.100,,but isn't he the only like pause filler candidate guy
41,7,2,00:02:57.800,00:03:01.000,00:00:03.200,,because didn't Ted Cruz dropped out or something
42,7,2,00:03:01.200,00:03:03.700,00:00:02.500,,and now it's just Donald Trump for the republican side
43,7,2,00:03:03.700,00:03:05.500,00:00:01.800,,like she's going to like
44,7,2,00:03:06.200,00:03:07.800,00:00:01.600,,yeah I don't know
45,7,2,00:03:07.800,00:03:09.800,00:00:02.000,,I'm not that much into politics
46,7,2,00:03:09.800,00:03:11.300,00:00:01.500,,but I did hear that Ted Cruz
47,7,2,00:03:11.400,00:03:15.600,00:00:04.200,yeah I think Ted Cruz actually did dropped out,
48,7,2,00:03:15.800,00:03:22.700,00:00:06.900,but I mean like Hilary might become president and like that other old guy,
49,7,2,00:03:22.700,00:03:23.400,00:00:00.700,,Bernie
50,7,2,00:03:23.700,00:03:24.900,00:00:01.200,yeah that person (laughter),
51,7,2,00:03:28.000,00:03:29.400,00:00:01.400,,it's confusing
52,7,2,00:03:31.300,00:03:33.300,00:00:02.000,,as long as Donald Trump isn't president
53,7,2,00:03:34.200,00:03:34.900,00:00:00.700,yeah,
54,7,2,00:03:35.900,00:03:36.400,00:00:00.500,,I'm okay
55,7,2,00:03:36.500,00:03:38.240,00:00:01.740,,well and yeah
56,7,2,00:03:51.500,00:03:56.900,00:00:05.400,,there's like all these little like buttons here on the side of the tablet thing
57,7,2,00:03:57.000,00:03:58.700,00:00:01.700,yeah I was actually looking at that,
58,7,2,00:04:00.100,00:04:01.700,00:00:01.600,,it's like complicated
59,7,2,00:04:01.700,00:04:04.300,00:00:02.600,,I don't want to touch any of them because I'd probably mess them up so
60,7,2,00:04:09.300,00:04:11.300,00:00:02.000,what team do you play for,
61,7,2,00:04:12.000,00:04:13.340,00:00:01.340,,pause filler I just play for my school
62,7,2,00:04:13.340,00:04:17.800,00:00:04.460,,I play for CAPA yeah
63,7,2,00:04:19.300,00:04:19.600,00:00:00.300,cool,
64,7,2,00:04:21.200,00:04:22.302,00:00:01.102,,where do you go again
65,7,2,00:04:24.600,00:04:24.800,00:00:00.200,,oh PUCS
66,7,2,00:04:27.055,00:04:28.600,00:00:01.545,,is that a middle school
67,7,2,00:04:28.800,00:04:29.400,00:00:00.600,,wait is that like
68,7,2,00:04:29.900,00:04:31.100,00:00:01.200,well it's k through eight,
69,7,2,00:04:34.800,00:04:35.300,00:00:00.500,,pause filler yeah
70,7,2,00:04:38.900,00:04:40.130,00:00:01.230,,you're in seventh grade
71,7,2,00:04:41.800,00:04:42.360,00:00:00.560,,same
72,7,2,00:04:46.000,00:04:50.600,00:00:04.600,,oh this mechanical pencil is I like mechanical pencils
73,7,2,00:04:50.600,00:04:54.100,00:00:03.500,,but the lead always breaks like when you use it
74,7,2,00:04:54.100,00:04:56.300,00:00:02.200,,because the lead always break
75,7,2,00:04:56.600,00:04:57.700,00:00:01.100,it's really annoying,
76,7,2,00:04:58.400,00:05:01.100,00:00:02.700,,yeah because the leads always really thin and just like snaps
77,7,2,00:05:01.300,00:05:02.910,00:00:01.610,,and it's like very
78,7,2,00:05:29.000,00:05:31.200,00:00:02.200,did you know that they're videotaping this,
79,7,2,00:05:32.100,00:05:35.480,00:00:03.380,,yeah did you (laughter)
80,7,2,00:05:33.700,00:05:34.130,00:00:00.430,pause filler PUCS,
81,7,2,00:05:37.040,00:05:39.100,00:00:02.060,,oh okay
82,7,2,00:06:09.500,00:06:11.200,00:00:01.700,wait can I just use this mouse,
83,7,2,00:06:14.900,00:06:17.000,00:00:02.100,it's kind of very hard to like do,
84,7,2,00:06:20.000,00:06:20.400,00:00:00.400,okay,
85,7,2,00:06:27.200,00:06:31.000,00:00:03.800,,okay I feel like I'm pause filler so I know what like to do
86,7,2,00:06:31.000,00:06:32.700,00:00:01.700,,but I don't know how to like do it
87,7,2,00:06:33.200,00:06:37.555,00:00:04.355,,because I know you have to do forty divided by three over seven but like
88,7,2,00:06:38.700,00:06:42.600,00:00:03.900,let's see the cheat sheet and,
89,7,2,00:06:42.600,00:06:46.200,00:00:03.600,,so you find the thing with like the matching thingy equation pause filler
90,7,2,00:06:46.930,00:06:48.910,00:00:01.980,the matching thingy equation,
91,7,2,00:06:48.910,00:06:49.400,00:00:00.490,I found that,
92,7,2,00:06:49.400,00:06:50.800,00:00:01.400,it's the first one (inaudible),
93,7,2,00:06:52.900,00:06:58.000,00:00:05.100,okay so first you have to multiply both sides by three over seven,
94,7,2,00:06:58.000,00:07:02.000,00:00:04.000,,okay negative or positive
95,7,2,00:07:03.600,00:07:04.000,00:00:00.400,positive,
96,7,2,00:07:08.880,00:07:10.050,00:00:01.170,,oh that's really bad
97,7,2,00:07:12.330,00:07:13.300,00:00:00.970,I have a mouse,
98,7,2,00:07:14.800,00:07:18.300,00:00:03.500,,oh really okay
99,7,2,00:07:18.400,00:07:19.600,00:00:01.200,your face it's like,
100,7,2,00:07:20.700,00:07:22.500,00:00:01.800,,I'm like trying so hard
101,7,2,00:07:24.000,00:07:28.200,00:00:04.200,,when you multiply we does that cancel out
102,7,2,00:07:28.200,00:07:30.860,00:00:02.660,,does the three over seven cancel out when you multiply it
103,7,2,00:07:33.670,00:07:35.600,00:00:01.930,,I have no idea (laughter)
104,7,2,00:07:37.800,00:07:38.800,00:00:01.000,,this is so good
105,7,2,00:07:40.560,00:07:42.920,00:00:02.360,I'm using a mouse (laughter),
106,7,2,00:07:46.130,00:07:47.420,00:00:01.290,it's nine over forty-nine,
107,7,2,00:07:49.200,00:07:51.330,00:00:02.130,,what oh three over seven
108,7,2,00:07:52.000,00:07:54.100,00:00:02.100,yeah and then we have to do three over,
109,7,2,00:07:54.100,00:07:57.000,00:00:02.900,,we (inaudible) three wait three over seven times three over
110,7,2,00:07:57.000,00:07:58.200,00:00:01.200,,oh yeah okay okay
111,7,2,00:07:58.400,00:07:59.000,00:00:00.600,both sides,
112,7,2,00:08:00.300,00:08:12.300,00:00:12.000,okay and now we have to do forty over one times three over seven equals seven,
113,7,2,00:08:13.400,00:08:16.900,00:00:03.500,what's all that one hundred twenty,
114,7,2,00:08:19.200,00:08:22.900,00:00:03.700,one hundred twenty over seven,
115,7,2,00:08:24.800,00:08:28.600,00:00:03.800,seven divided by one hundred twenty is,
116,7,2,00:08:28.600,00:08:30.000,00:00:01.400,,a fraction
117,7,2,00:08:30.000,00:08:32.800,00:00:02.800,this is so confusing,
118,7,2,00:08:32.800,00:08:34.700,00:00:01.900,,wait seven divided by one hundred twenty
119,7,2,00:08:34.900,00:08:35.200,00:00:00.300,yeah,
120,7,2,00:08:35.800,00:08:38.000,00:00:02.200,,just write it as a fraction just write it like
121,7,2,00:08:38.300,00:08:39.200,00:00:00.900,that is a fraction,
122,7,2,00:08:39.300,00:08:41.900,00:00:02.600,but I have to write it as a mixed fraction,
123,7,2,00:08:42.400,00:08:45.300,00:00:02.900,,you mean like a you have to divide it
124,7,2,00:08:46.800,00:08:48.846,00:00:02.046,well it's pretty much a division problem,
125,7,2,00:08:50.200,00:08:50.710,00:00:00.510,,okay
126,7,2,00:08:51.500,00:08:53.600,00:00:02.100,so if I wrote it like this,
127,7,2,00:08:58.470,00:08:59.000,00:00:00.530,,I can't see
128,7,2,00:08:59.500,00:09:02.495,00:00:02.995,,wait do I have to move down wait
129,7,2,00:09:03.800,00:09:04.500,00:00:00.700,,oh my gosh
130,7,2,00:09:05.000,00:09:05.700,00:00:00.700,,so pause filler
131,7,2,00:09:05.700,00:09:06.700,00:00:01.000,,can I scroll down
132,7,2,00:09:06.700,00:09:11.396,00:00:04.696,,oh here we go okay (laughter)
133,7,2,00:09:11.396,00:09:13.200,00:00:01.804,,I'm trying to scroll down
134,7,2,00:09:13.700,00:09:15.800,00:00:02.100,,did you scroll down to
135,7,2,00:09:15.800,00:09:17.500,00:00:01.700,,oh oh oh there we go
136,7,2,00:09:17.500,00:09:19.400,00:00:01.900,,I see it okay
137,7,2,00:09:19.800,00:09:28.400,00:00:08.600,yay okay so pretty much what you have to well it's pretty,
138,7,2,00:09:28.400,00:09:31.200,00:00:02.800,it is a division problem do you see how it's like,
139,7,2,00:09:32.500,00:09:35.100,00:00:02.600,this is like a division problem,
140,7,2,00:09:35.600,00:09:37.700,00:00:02.100,so if I read it another way,
141,7,2,00:09:37.700,00:09:39.300,00:00:01.600,I can write it one,
142,7,2,00:09:39.500,00:09:42.800,00:00:03.300,,how did you get to one hundred twenty divided by four
143,7,2,00:09:42.800,00:09:48.600,00:00:05.800,I pause filler multiplied forty over one which is pretty much forty pause filler,
144,7,2,00:09:50.000,00:09:51.400,00:00:01.400,,but why did you do that
145,7,2,00:09:51.800,00:09:54.400,00:00:02.600,because it equals the whole number forty,
146,7,2,00:09:55.600,00:09:59.200,00:00:03.600,if it was one over forty that would be a fraction a different kind of number,
147,7,2,00:10:02.175,00:10:04.900,00:00:02.725,but since it's not it's a whole number,
148,7,2,00:10:06.000,00:10:09.378,00:00:03.378,so that's how I learned it so yeah,
149,7,2,00:10:09.000,00:10:12.200,00:00:03.200,,okay do you want to like erase this to make more room
150,7,2,00:10:13.000,00:10:13.895,00:00:00.895,yeah I can do that,
151,7,2,00:10:14.475,00:10:17.700,00:00:03.225,,okay I'm really bad at the eraser (laughter)
152,7,2,00:10:18.400,00:10:21.900,00:00:03.500,,wait I'm trying to find the eraser thing
153,7,2,00:10:21.900,00:10:23.100,00:00:01.200,,stop no
154,7,2,00:10:24.700,00:10:25.800,00:00:01.100,,okay I'm black right
155,7,2,00:10:25.800,00:10:27.600,00:00:01.800,,mine is black again
156,7,2,00:10:27.800,00:10:29.400,00:00:01.600,you're more dark green,
157,7,2,00:10:30.000,00:10:32.400,00:00:02.400,,yeah I think it's a dark green but I don't know
158,7,2,00:10:32.500,00:10:33.678,00:00:01.178,she said black,
159,7,2,00:10:34.800,00:10:37.300,00:00:02.500,,yeah oh wait should I put it like on black
160,7,2,00:10:39.300,00:10:41.800,00:00:02.500,,wait yeah I think it's like a dark green
161,7,2,00:10:42.600,00:10:43.100,00:00:00.500,okay,
162,7,2,00:10:43.200,00:10:44.737,00:00:01.537,,or now it's only black
163,7,2,00:10:45.880,00:10:50.268,00:00:04.388,,there we go okay okay
164,7,2,00:10:49.600,00:10:52.900,00:00:03.300,mine would be mint green okay,
165,7,2,00:10:52.900,00:10:57.100,00:00:04.200,so we were at one twenty,
166,7,2,00:10:57.300,00:10:59.500,00:00:02.200,,yeah here look at the equation in the cheat sheet again
167,7,2,00:11:00.000,00:11:00.900,00:00:00.900,,I mean we were like okay
168,7,2,00:11:00.900,00:11:08.080,00:00:07.180,,let's go through the steps so (laughter) just to show it to me okay
169,7,2,00:11:08.080,00:11:10.300,00:00:02.220,,so what did they do first
170,7,2,00:11:14.000,00:11:15.300,00:00:01.300,boy I'm stupid,
171,7,2,00:11:15.300,00:11:16.100,00:00:00.800,that's the answer,
172,7,2,00:11:17.200,00:11:18.256,00:00:01.056,,what one twenty
173,7,2,00:11:18.700,00:11:26.700,00:00:08.000,one twenty (laughter) (inaudible) sorry,
174,7,2,00:11:26.700,00:11:30.600,00:00:03.900,pause filler what was the fraction again seven,
175,7,2,00:11:31.700,00:11:32.834,00:00:01.134,that is the answer,
176,7,2,00:11:38.500,00:11:39.300,00:00:00.800,,aw
177,7,2,00:11:41.000,00:11:42.500,00:00:01.500,I don't know (laughter),
178,7,2,00:11:41.000,00:11:42.000,00:00:01.000,,hey wait did you do
179,7,2,00:11:42.500,00:11:44.500,00:00:02.000,,did you do forty time three
180,7,2,00:11:45.800,00:11:47.500,00:00:01.700,uh-uh this whole thing,
181,7,2,00:11:47.800,00:11:49.000,00:00:01.200,I did it time this,
182,7,2,00:11:49.900,00:11:50.749,00:00:00.849,,the what
183,7,2,00:11:50.500,00:11:52.995,00:00:02.495,well that's a good box (sfx),
184,7,2,00:11:52.995,00:11:55.600,00:00:02.605,okay sorry (laughter),
185,7,2,00:11:55.600,00:12:02.200,00:00:06.600,so I just do three over seven times that over four over one,
186,7,2,00:12:03.200,00:12:05.200,00:00:02.000,,but why did you wait
187,7,2,00:12:05.200,00:12:06.600,00:00:01.400,,can you just keep it forty
188,7,2,00:12:07.400,00:12:07.900,00:00:00.500,no,
189,7,2,00:12:08.000,00:12:13.118,00:00:05.118,but well a fraction is easier when you do,
190,7,2,00:12:12.400,00:12:15.800,00:00:03.400,,oh you just do it over one to make it easier yeah okay
191,7,2,00:12:16.600,00:12:18.400,00:00:01.800,so yeah okay next problem,
192,7,2,00:12:19.700,00:12:23.900,00:00:04.200,,okay fourteen equals three okay (inaudible)
193,7,2,00:12:23.900,00:12:24.200,00:00:00.300,okay got it,
194,7,2,00:12:24.200,00:12:25.100,00:00:00.900,I got it,
195,7,2,00:12:25.100,00:12:29.800,00:00:04.700,,you have to do three eight pause filler on each side times three eight on each side
196,7,2,00:12:30.100,00:12:31.400,00:00:01.300,yes you got it,
197,7,2,00:12:32.590,00:12:34.000,00:00:01.410,,oh okay
198,7,2,00:12:34.590,00:12:34.970,00:00:00.380,okay,
199,7,2,00:12:35.600,00:12:37.600,00:00:02.000,,can we just do some mental math okay
200,7,2,00:12:37.600,00:12:40.200,00:00:02.600,,that would be nine over sixty-four
201,7,2,00:12:42.000,00:12:42.500,00:00:00.500,,I think
202,7,2,00:12:42.500,00:12:50.400,00:00:07.900,,yeah nine over sixty oh my gosh nine over sixty-four k
203,7,2,00:12:50.400,00:12:51.800,00:00:01.400,why don't you just use this,
204,7,2,00:12:52.700,00:12:53.500,00:00:00.800,,what
205,7,2,00:12:53.500,00:12:55.370,00:00:01.870,this it's neither,
206,7,2,00:12:56.700,00:12:59.300,00:00:02.600,,what like a pencil
207,7,2,00:12:59.300,00:13:00.280,00:00:00.980,,is that the type of pencil
208,7,2,00:13:01.700,00:13:05.500,00:00:03.800,you just how about you just my like writing and then,
209,7,2,00:13:05.500,00:13:08.600,00:00:03.100,so it's neither and you can actually understand it,
210,7,2,00:13:09.400,00:13:10.200,00:00:00.800,,what do you mean
211,7,2,00:13:11.700,00:13:13.760,00:00:02.060,pause filler hold up,
212,7,2,00:13:14.600,00:13:17.700,00:00:03.100,,here maybe if I just like write bigger
213,7,2,00:13:18.200,00:13:19.600,00:00:01.400,that just takes up more room,
214,7,2,00:13:20.100,00:13:21.800,00:00:01.700,I can write for you,
215,7,2,00:13:23.500,00:13:24.100,00:00:00.600,,it's fine
216,7,2,00:13:24.100,00:13:26.100,00:00:02.000,,see that works that works
217,7,2,00:13:27.000,00:13:31.900,00:00:04.900,,so nine over sixty-four k equals
218,7,2,00:13:31.900,00:13:36.900,00:00:05.000,,and then we have to do fourteen times three over eight right
219,7,2,00:13:38.700,00:13:40.700,00:00:02.000,multiply by both sides,
220,7,2,00:13:40.700,00:13:46.160,00:00:05.460,so you want to multiply three over eight by fourteen and times that by itself,
221,7,2,00:13:46.500,00:13:47.600,00:00:01.100,,okay let's do it
222,7,2,00:13:47.600,00:13:49.200,00:00:01.600,,okay so you already have it written down
223,7,2,00:13:49.200,00:13:51.200,00:00:02.000,,fourteen so fourteen time three
224,7,2,00:13:51.900,00:13:53.217,00:00:01.317,,I'm just going to use a calculator
225,7,2,00:13:53.217,00:13:59.000,00:00:05.783,,okay so fourteen times three would be
226,7,2,00:14:00.700,00:14:02.100,00:00:01.400,,I'll just do it up here
227,7,2,00:14:02.800,00:14:04.016,00:00:01.216,forty-two,
228,7,2,00:14:05.400,00:14:06.337,00:00:00.937,,oh you did it
229,7,2,00:14:08.100,00:14:10.400,00:00:02.300,,okay oh yeah yeah okay
230,7,2,00:14:10.400,00:14:16.000,00:00:05.600,,so forty-two over eight so forty-two over eight equals that
231,7,2,00:14:18.800,00:14:21.900,00:00:03.100,oh I'm so stupid,
232,7,2,00:14:22.200,00:14:22.800,00:00:00.600,,what
233,7,2,00:14:22.900,00:14:24.700,00:00:01.800,nothing I can't tell you,
234,7,2,00:14:24.700,00:14:27.600,00:00:02.900,,you can't tell me
235,7,2,00:14:29.300,00:14:30.900,00:00:01.600,,forty-two over eight
236,7,2,00:14:31.100,00:14:32.700,00:00:01.600,,that's a great forty-two
237,7,2,00:14:37.300,00:14:40.230,00:00:02.930,,actually that's a terrible forty-two pause filler okay
238,7,2,00:14:44.230,00:14:45.400,00:00:01.170,,are you in the purple room
239,7,2,00:14:46.700,00:14:47.800,00:00:01.100,what purple room,
240,7,2,00:14:47.800,00:14:49.600,00:00:01.800,,is your what color is your room

243,7,2,00:14:55.600,00:14:58.200,00:00:02.600,,see I was just in a purple room and then they moved me
244,7,2,00:14:58.500,00:15:00.000,00:00:01.500,it's actually blue,
245,7,2,00:14:58.500,00:14:59.700,00:00:01.200,,I think it's purple
246,7,2,00:15:01.000,00:15:07.000,00:00:06.000,,oh oh maybe I was in the I don't know okay so forty-two
247,7,2,00:15:06.000,00:15:11.600,00:00:05.600,no you were in this room right with the poster with Peter,

254,7,2,00:15:20.400,00:15:29.600,00:00:09.200,,well so now you have to get forty-two over eight equal nine over sixty-four times k
255,7,2,00:15:29.600,00:15:31.700,00:00:02.100,,and what do we do next
256,7,2,00:15:31.700,00:15:33.500,00:00:01.800,,what does it say on the like
257,7,2,00:15:33.700,00:15:35.700,00:00:02.000,,what's the next part of the equation thing
258,7,2,00:15:38.400,00:15:39.500,00:00:01.100,that's the answer,
259,7,2,00:15:40.800,00:15:42.900,00:00:02.100,,really well what do you do with the nine
260,7,2,00:15:42.900,00:15:44.300,00:00:01.400,,like do you have to get k
261,7,2,00:15:44.300,00:15:47.400,00:00:03.100,,is k alone like this k on its own
262,7,2,00:15:47.400,00:15:49.300,00:00:01.900,,or is there anything next to k
263,7,2,00:15:50.800,00:15:52.700,00:00:01.900,it's right here sweetheart (laughter),
264,7,2,00:15:57.000,00:15:58.500,00:00:01.500,,what do you mean

267,7,2,00:16:05.000,00:16:10.790,00:00:05.790,,no because there's nine over sixty-four right next to k right here see
268,7,2,00:16:18.400,00:16:23.200,00:00:04.800,oh sorry I got this completely wrong okay so,

284,7,2,00:17:37.300,00:17:37.900,00:00:00.600,yeah,
285,7,2,00:17:39.600,00:17:51.700,00:00:12.100,okay so first you have to do fourteen over one times eight over three,
286,7,2,00:17:52.200,00:17:53.900,00:00:01.700,,do you mean three over eight
287,7,2,00:17:54.400,00:17:56.100,00:00:01.700,nope eight over three,
288,7,2,00:17:56.600,00:17:58.200,00:00:01.600,,why are you searching the fraction
289,7,2,00:17:58.800,00:18:00.900,00:00:02.100,it just told me to do that,
290,7,2,00:18:02.100,00:18:02.700,00:00:00.600,,really
291,7,2,00:18:03.000,00:18:03.900,00:00:00.900,yes,
292,7,2,00:18:06.300,00:18:06.800,00:00:00.500,,there
293,7,2,00:18:07.000,00:18:08.300,00:00:01.300,you can just use this,
294,7,2,00:18:09.300,00:18:11.500,00:00:02.200,,what (laughter)
295,7,2,00:18:13.600,00:18:15.300,00:00:01.700,what's this times that,
296,7,2,00:18:17.700,00:18:18.400,00:00:00.700,,okay
297,7,2,00:18:18.400,00:18:20.700,00:00:02.300,,what's fourteen time wait
298,7,2,00:18:20.700,00:18:21.700,00:00:01.000,,why are you switching it though
299,7,2,00:18:22.600,00:18:24.200,00:00:01.600,it says it tells me to do that,
300,7,2,00:18:24.200,00:18:25.770,00:00:01.570,I have no idea,
301,7,2,00:18:31.400,00:18:36.100,00:00:04.700,,pause filler the last time didn't we do three over pause filler didn't we multiply each side by three over eight
302,7,2,00:18:41.100,00:18:45.480,00:00:04.380,okay so let's go back to the first problem,
303,7,2,00:18:47.000,00:18:49.000,00:00:02.000,okay so we did this wrong sorry,
304,7,2,00:18:49.800,00:18:52.500,00:00:02.700,we're supposed to do seven over three,
305,7,2,00:18:53.300,00:18:53.900,00:00:00.600,,really
306,7,2,00:18:54.800,00:19:04.500,00:00:09.700,so this is three and seven time forty is two eighty,
307,7,2,00:19:05.500,00:19:10.900,00:00:05.400,,yeah so two eighty over three equals
308,7,2,00:19:12.000,00:19:12.300,00:00:00.300,,pause filler wait
309,7,2,00:19:15.200,00:19:18.320,00:00:03.120,,wait is it pause filler
310,7,2,00:19:16.700,00:19:18.200,00:00:01.500,wait no that's the answer,
311,7,2,00:19:19.000,00:19:29.070,00:00:10.070,,is it not a thing when you like switch it around the no
312,7,2,00:19:29.600,00:19:30.800,00:00:01.200,it's an improper fraction,
313,7,2,00:19:31.100,00:19:34.400,00:00:03.300,,no like when you do three over seven times seven over three
314,7,2,00:19:34.400,00:19:37.300,00:00:02.900,,isn't that like a don't be like cancel out
315,7,2,00:19:40.000,00:19:40.700,00:00:00.700,,(laughter)
316,7,2,00:19:43.900,00:19:44.900,00:00:01.000,,what's it called
317,7,2,00:19:44.000,00:19:45.600,00:00:01.600,oh yeah you do cancel out,
318,7,2,00:19:44.900,00:19:48.450,00:00:03.550,,reciprocals is that what it's called
319,7,2,00:19:49.250,00:19:49.700,00:00:00.450,,I don't know
320,7,2,00:19:49.700,00:19:54.280,00:00:04.580,,but do they cancel this three when you do over three over seven time seven over three
321,7,2,00:19:53.200,00:19:54.600,00:00:01.400,this is no more,
322,7,2,00:19:55.300,00:19:56.000,00:00:00.700,,bye
323,7,2,00:19:57.300,00:19:58.100,00:00:00.800,see you later,
324,7,2,00:19:58.300,00:20:03.200,00:00:04.900,,wait okay so then so then we have to do two eighty divide
325,7,2,00:20:03.200,00:20:05.000,00:00:01.800,,or should we just keep the fraction
326,7,2,00:20:05.400,00:20:07.020,00:00:01.620,,or do we have to divide it
327,7,2,00:20:08.200,00:20:09.800,00:00:01.600,we leave that because it's done,
328,7,2,00:20:10.800,00:20:17.010,00:00:06.210,,so it's s equals two hundred eighty over three all right
329,7,2,00:20:16.400,00:20:17.000,00:00:00.600,that's it,
330,7,2,00:20:18.000,00:20:19.900,00:00:01.900,,okay now let's redo the next one
331,7,2,00:20:21.000,00:20:23.100,00:00:02.100,,last time was so much easier than this
332,7,2,00:20:24.300,00:20:25.000,00:00:00.700,,do you remember
333,7,2,00:20:25.800,00:20:30.700,00:00:04.900,okay so I have in my ears pierced,
334,7,2,00:20:30.700,00:20:32.700,00:00:02.000,but I never put any earrings,
335,7,2,00:20:32.700,00:20:37.000,00:00:04.300,,oh like it feels weird when you put on headphones
336,7,2,00:20:37.000,00:20:38.500,00:00:01.500,,and like you have earrings
337,7,2,00:20:38.500,00:20:39.900,00:00:01.400,,and like I only wear like studs
338,7,2,00:20:39.900,00:20:44.700,00:00:04.800,,but okay fourteen over one times eight over three
339,7,2,00:20:44.700,00:20:50.200,00:00:05.500,,and then three over times eight over three would cancel out right
340,7,2,00:20:50.200,00:20:51.200,00:00:01.000,one twenty over three,
341,7,2,00:20:51.600,00:20:57.200,00:00:05.600,wait one eleven what one one two one hundred twelve sorry,
342,7,2,00:20:57.400,00:21:00.300,00:00:02.900,,one one oh (inaudible)
343,7,2,00:21:02.500,00:21:04.700,00:00:02.200,okay and over three,
344,7,2,00:21:05.500,00:21:06.700,00:00:01.200,ooh that's a nice three,
345,7,2,00:21:08.000,00:21:09.800,00:00:01.800,,I don't even know what this is down here
346,7,2,00:21:11.000,00:21:11.400,00:00:00.400,,what did I do
347,7,2,00:21:11.400,00:21:16.800,00:00:05.400,,it's like a heart by looking at it
348,7,2,00:21:17.000,00:21:19.200,00:00:02.200,I don't no idea okay,
349,7,2,00:21:20.900,00:21:21.100,00:00:00.200,,okay
350,7,2,00:21:21.500,00:21:22.600,00:00:01.100,that's the answer,
351,7,2,00:21:23.600,00:21:26.520,00:00:02.920,,one hundred twelve over three equals k
352,7,2,00:21:28.080,00:21:29.300,00:00:01.220,but we have to do this wait,
353,7,2,00:21:31.600,00:21:32.000,00:00:00.400,,what
354,7,2,00:21:36.200,00:21:37.400,00:00:01.200,what are you doing,
355,7,2,00:21:37.400,00:21:39.500,00:00:02.100,,(laughter) it's a fancy k
356,7,2,00:21:44.400,00:21:45.800,00:00:01.400,this is slow today,
357,7,2,00:21:46.700,00:21:51.000,00:00:04.300,,oh yeah like how like a second later it kind of like yeah
358,7,2,00:21:53.200,00:21:54.300,00:00:01.100,,oh my gosh okay
359,7,2,00:21:54.500,00:21:55.900,00:00:01.400,,so should we go to the next one
360,7,2,00:21:56.300,00:21:57.830,00:00:01.530,that's a fancy k,
361,7,2,00:21:58.570,00:22:01.470,00:00:02.900,I have no idea what it is I actually,
362,7,2,00:22:01.000,00:22:05.600,00:00:04.600,,oh (laughter) is this the next one
363,7,2,00:22:05.700,00:22:07.000,00:00:01.300,,oh gosh this one looks harder
364,7,2,00:22:07.200,00:22:08.500,00:00:01.300,,wait I know what we do
365,7,2,00:22:08.500,00:22:09.200,00:00:00.700,,I know what we do
366,7,2,00:22:09.000,00:22:09.970,00:00:00.970,are you sure,
367,7,2,00:22:09.200,00:22:09.700,00:00:00.500,,you add eighteen
368,7,2,00:22:10.400,00:22:11.900,00:00:01.500,,you add eighteen to each side
369,7,2,00:22:12.500,00:22:12.900,00:00:00.400,wait,
370,7,2,00:22:13.400,00:22:17.700,00:00:04.300,,mm-hmm because then you cancel out eighteen on this side
371,7,2,00:22:18.300,00:22:19.900,00:00:01.600,,and you just make the other side bigger
372,7,2,00:22:21.800,00:22:26.200,00:00:04.400,,okay I'm just going to like okay what's fifty-two plus eighteen
373,7,2,00:22:26.200,00:22:29.100,00:00:02.900,,it is seventy right
374,7,2,00:22:30.500,00:22:39.380,00:00:08.880,,yeah seventy it's seventy equals ew equals (laughter)
375,7,2,00:22:39.380,00:22:43.000,00:00:03.620,,and then since you added eighteen to the negative eighteen
376,7,2,00:22:43.300,00:22:45.500,00:00:02.200,,it's then just negative two y
377,7,2,00:22:45.500,00:22:49.860,00:00:04.360,,it's negative two over three y (laughter)
378,7,2,00:22:54.100,00:22:55.810,00:00:01.710,,you have a big question mark (laughter)
379,7,2,00:22:57.720,00:22:59.200,00:00:01.480,,so you got that
380,7,2,00:22:59.900,00:23:02.900,00:00:03.000,yes but that's not all the answers though,
381,7,2,00:23:03.000,00:23:03.900,00:00:00.900,,well I know that
382,7,2,00:23:03.900,00:23:05.000,00:00:01.100,,I know that's not the answer
383,7,2,00:23:05.100,00:23:10.500,00:00:05.400,,but then do we do three over negative pause filler
384,7,2,00:23:10.360,00:23:13.000,00:00:02.640,oh I know the I don't know the answer,
385,7,2,00:23:13.000,00:23:14.200,00:00:01.200,but I know what to do next,
386,7,2,00:23:14.200,00:23:17.400,00:00:03.200,okay do you want the next pause filler thing,
387,7,2,00:23:18.700,00:23:21.000,00:00:02.300,,should we just like finish this one though
388,7,2,00:23:23.100,00:23:26.000,00:00:02.900,so did you add eighteen to both sides,
389,7,2,00:23:27.100,00:23:28.200,00:00:01.100,,pause filler yeah and
390,7,2,00:23:28.200,00:23:30.200,00:00:02.000,eighteen plus fifty-two,
391,7,2,00:23:30.800,00:23:31.600,00:00:00.800,,is seventy
392,7,2,00:23:31.600,00:23:32.400,00:00:00.800,,yeah I got that
393,7,2,00:23:33.500,00:23:41.200,00:00:07.700,okay so then you have to take the excuse me pause filler to the fraction,
394,7,2,00:23:41.200,00:23:44.700,00:00:03.500,and then you have to multiply it on both sides,
395,7,2,00:23:46.500,00:23:48.400,00:00:01.900,,again like we did the last one
396,7,2,00:23:48.400,00:23:51.300,00:00:02.900,but you have to make it inproper so flip it,
397,7,2,00:23:51.900,00:23:56.900,00:00:05.000,,okay okay so negative three over two
398,7,2,00:23:56.900,00:23:58.400,00:00:01.500,,so that would cancel out right
399,7,2,00:23:58.800,00:23:59.700,00:00:00.900,wait hold up,
400,7,2,00:24:00.200,00:24:04.000,00:00:03.800,,if I did negative two over three time three negative three over two
401,7,2,00:24:04.000,00:24:05.800,00:00:01.800,,that would cancel out right
402,7,2,00:24:05.800,00:24:06.900,00:00:01.100,pause filler,
403,7,2,00:24:06.900,00:24:09.300,00:00:02.400,,would it I think yeah
404,7,2,00:24:09.300,00:24:10.500,00:00:01.200,,because in the last one it did
405,7,2,00:24:10.900,00:24:13.700,00:00:02.800,yeah and the one before that,
406,7,2,00:24:14.400,00:24:24.900,00:00:10.500,,mm-hmm okay I'm never going to just have to do seventy over three over two wait
407,7,2,00:24:25.000,00:24:27.200,00:00:02.200,,let me do the other one
408,7,2,00:24:27.200,00:24:29.400,00:00:02.200,,is it seventy over three over two or
409,7,2,00:24:29.400,00:24:30.300,00:00:00.900,wait hold up,
410,7,2,00:24:30.500,00:24:35.400,00:00:04.900,seventy times three,
411,7,2,00:24:35.400,00:24:37.300,00:00:01.900,,pause filler I mean two over three (inaudible)
412,7,2,00:24:37.300,00:24:39.600,00:00:02.300,over two equals what,
413,7,2,00:24:40.700,00:24:41.700,00:00:01.000,,okay let's think
414,7,2,00:24:41.900,00:24:43.200,00:00:01.300,,two hundred ten
415,7,2,00:24:43.500,00:24:49.600,00:00:06.100,,I'm just like wait no yeah wait no two thousand one hundred
416,7,2,00:24:47.600,00:24:48.700,00:00:01.100,no,
417,7,2,00:24:49.700,00:24:58.200,00:00:08.500,,like now because three time seven is twenty-one yeah two thousand one hundred what pause filler
418,7,2,00:24:58.500,00:24:59.700,00:00:01.200,hold up let me see,
419,7,2,00:25:06.600,00:25:07.200,00:00:00.600,two ten,
420,7,2,00:25:08.300,00:25:09.900,00:00:01.600,,but that doesn't seem right
421,7,2,00:25:10.400,00:25:12.350,00:00:01.950,,like seventy times three
422,7,2,00:25:13.910,00:25:16.330,00:00:02.420,,oh yeah actually yeah okay
423,7,2,00:25:16.330,00:25:19.000,00:00:02.670,,let's just go with it and then okay so then
424,7,2,00:25:18.800,00:25:20.400,00:00:01.600,and then we have to divide it,
425,7,2,00:25:21.700,00:25:23.200,00:00:01.500,,or can't we just keep it as a fraction
426,7,2,00:25:24.300,00:25:25.400,00:00:01.100,,we can't
427,7,2,00:25:26.300,00:25:26.700,00:00:00.400,,why
428,7,2,00:25:28.020,00:25:28.900,00:00:00.880,I don't know,
429,7,2,00:25:29.500,00:25:33.100,00:00:03.600,,well okay divide it by two that is a hundred and five
430,7,2,00:25:34.200,00:25:35.200,00:00:01.000,no,
431,7,2,00:25:38.000,00:25:40.600,00:00:02.600,find it's Gs,
432,7,2,00:25:41.900,00:25:43.900,00:00:02.000,,yup I'll just write a hundred and five
433,7,2,00:25:47.700,00:25:51.300,00:00:03.600,,pause filler that's a really bad zero a hundred
434,7,2,00:25:51.300,00:25:56.300,00:00:05.000,,that looks like a snail (inaudible) right there
435,7,2,00:25:56.300,00:25:58.700,00:00:02.400,,a hundred and five equals y all right
436,7,2,00:25:58.900,00:26:00.000,00:00:01.100,,should we do the next one
437,7,2,00:26:00.900,00:26:02.200,00:00:01.300,there now it's a snail,
438,7,2,00:26:03.700,00:26:04.400,00:00:00.700,,oh (laughter)
439,7,2,00:26:06.800,00:26:08.900,00:00:02.100,,okay let's just do the next one
440,7,2,00:26:11.400,00:26:16.600,00:00:05.200,,okie doke now last one we added eighteen to each side
441,7,2,00:26:16.600,00:26:20.100,00:00:03.500,,now we're subtracting eighteen no thirteen right
442,7,2,00:26:23.000,00:26:23.900,00:00:00.900,no no no no,
443,7,2,00:26:24.200,00:26:25.100,00:00:00.900,well yes we are,
444,7,2,00:26:25.200,00:26:28.100,00:00:02.900,,because then you'll cancel out the thirteen on that side
445,7,2,00:26:28.100,00:26:29.500,00:00:01.400,,and then we'll just make the other one bigger
446,7,2,00:26:29.500,00:26:32.500,00:00:03.000,,so should we just subtract that
447,7,2,00:26:33.400,00:26:38.000,00:00:04.600,,so just yeah just subtract it I think
448,7,2,00:26:40.100,00:26:40.200,00:00:00.100,,oh

557,7,2,00:35:11.300,00:35:12.500,00:00:01.200,,here we go
558,7,2,00:35:12.500,00:35:17.100,00:00:04.600,,times x well times x okay well
559,7,2,00:35:17.100,00:35:19.700,00:00:02.600,,so then well what do you think is going to happen
560,7,2,00:35:25.700,00:35:26.400,00:00:00.700,,done
561,7,2,00:35:29.000,00:35:31.400,00:00:02.400,,and then you multiply x each side
562,7,2,00:35:33.500,00:35:36.900,00:00:03.400,the x on the bottom of the fraction goes away,
563,7,2,00:35:37.200,00:35:37.800,00:00:00.600,,yeah so
564,7,2,00:35:37.800,00:35:39.200,00:00:01.400,and then it's just one,
565,7,2,00:35:39.700,00:35:41.500,00:00:01.800,,yeah and then the other side
566,7,2,00:35:41.000,00:35:44.700,00:00:03.700,one times twenty-five which equals twenty-fivex,
567,7,2,00:35:46.000,00:35:46.400,00:00:00.400,,whoa
568,7,2,00:35:46.400,00:35:48.388,00:00:01.988,,now twenty-five times x
569,7,2,00:35:48.700,00:35:50.400,00:00:01.700,yeah twenty-fivex,
570,7,2,00:35:52.100,00:35:52.400,00:00:00.300,,wait
571,7,2,00:35:54.400,00:35:57.300,00:00:02.900,sorry I had a very sour one in my mouth okay,
572,7,2,00:35:58.700,00:36:00.600,00:00:01.900,equals twenty-five x,
573,7,2,00:36:05.000,00:36:06.100,00:00:01.100,,yeah but then
574,7,2,00:36:17.400,00:36:19.100,00:00:01.700,,yeah I think it's that
575,7,2,00:36:20.100,00:36:24.200,00:00:04.100,,no because you want to get x alone
576,7,2,00:36:27.600,00:36:32.400,00:00:04.800,,so maybe if you divide each side
577,7,2,00:36:33.200,00:36:34.900,00:00:01.700,,yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay
578,7,2,00:36:35.000,00:36:38.200,00:00:03.200,,you have to divide each side by twenty-five because then
579,7,2,00:36:38.300,00:36:41.200,00:00:02.900,,x on this side is going to just is going to be
580,7,2,00:36:43.100,00:36:44.900,00:00:01.800,,hello it's
581,7,2,00:36:44.900,00:36:47.120,00:00:02.220,you can actually read that,
582,7,2,00:36:47.000,00:36:47.500,00:00:00.500,,yeah
583,7,2,00:36:49.700,00:36:50.300,00:00:00.600,how,
584,7,2,00:36:54.200,00:36:55.000,00:00:00.800,,I just can
585,7,2,00:36:56.500,00:36:59.000,00:00:02.500,,but going on ok
586,7,2,00:37:01.000,00:37:02.000,00:00:01.000,,if we
587,7,2,00:37:04.270,00:37:04.810,00:00:00.540,,divide
588,7,2,00:37:04.300,00:37:05.500,00:00:01.200,you're like wow,
589,7,2,00:37:05.800,00:37:10.100,00:00:04.300,this is like you're skipping like all over like,
590,7,2,00:37:10.100,00:37:11.500,00:00:01.400,it's going very slow,
591,7,2,00:37:11.800,00:37:13.200,00:00:01.400,,like I'm moving like is it
592,7,2,00:37:13.200,00:37:16.400,00:00:03.200,you move and then it like stops,
593,7,2,00:37:16.400,00:37:19.700,00:00:03.300,,yeah I don't know okay
594,7,2,00:37:24.700,00:37:26.100,00:00:01.400,,it's the sour stuff
595,7,2,00:37:30.900,00:37:34.400,00:00:03.500,,okay (laughter) in fact it's actually not that sour
596,7,2,00:37:34.400,00:37:40.300,00:00:05.900,,but okay so if we divide each side by twenty-five so because then what will happen to this side
597,7,2,00:37:40.300,00:37:41.600,00:00:01.300,,is it will just be x alone
598,7,2,00:37:41.600,00:37:43.000,00:00:01.400,,and that will be
599,7,2,00:37:43.000,00:37:44.100,00:00:01.100,,what will that be
600,7,2,00:37:45.700,00:37:46.400,00:00:00.700,onex,
601,7,2,00:37:46.900,00:37:48.000,00:00:01.100,,one over twenty-five
602,7,2,00:37:48.200,00:37:51.300,00:00:03.100,,because if we're dividing this by twenty-five
603,7,2,00:37:51.600,00:37:54.400,00:00:02.800,,then it will be one divided by twenty-five which is that
604,7,2,00:37:54.400,00:37:56.200,00:00:01.800,,and then divide that by twenty-five
605,7,2,00:37:56.400,00:37:58.700,00:00:02.300,,and then it's just going to be x alone
606,7,2,00:37:58.700,00:38:00.800,00:00:02.100,,so whatever twenty-five equals x
607,7,2,00:38:04.300,00:38:05.200,00:00:00.900,,I have two left
608,7,2,00:38:05.700,00:38:06.600,00:00:00.900,,how many do you have left
609,7,2,00:38:06.600,00:38:08.300,00:00:01.700,I have no idea,
610,7,2,00:38:08.300,00:38:12.200,00:00:03.900,,(laughter) all right let's go to the next one
611,7,2,00:38:16.900,00:38:20.100,00:00:03.200,,okay I know what you do for this but
612,7,2,00:38:20.300,00:38:20.900,00:00:00.600,I do too,
613,7,2,00:38:21.100,00:38:21.700,00:00:00.600,,what do you do
614,7,2,00:38:22.000,00:38:23.900,00:00:01.900,you have to add them to both sides,
615,7,2,00:38:23.900,00:38:25.200,00:00:01.300,seventeen to both sides,
616,7,2,00:38:25.600,00:38:27.600,00:00:02.000,,okay well do that
617,7,2,00:38:31.600,00:38:32.800,00:00:01.200,I'm going to be red,
618,7,2,00:38:33.400,00:38:33.800,00:00:00.400,,red
619,7,2,00:38:34.900,00:38:36.700,00:00:01.800,,well I think you're supposed to be black
620,7,2,00:38:37.200,00:38:37.800,00:00:00.600,who cares,
621,7,2,00:38:40.700,00:38:43.000,00:00:02.300,,rebel (laughter)
622,7,2,00:38:57.400,00:38:58.600,00:00:01.200,,just try that
623,7,2,00:38:58.600,00:38:59.900,00:00:01.300,,no no you don't have to multiply
624,7,2,00:39:00.000,00:39:01.300,00:00:01.300,,you just have to add
625,7,2,00:39:04.000,00:39:05.100,00:00:01.100,,like yeah let me show you
626,7,2,00:39:05.100,00:39:08.200,00:00:03.100,,so you add seventeen to this side
627,7,2,00:39:08.400,00:39:10.400,00:00:02.000,,then that will cancel out right
628,7,2,00:39:10.600,00:39:10.800,00:00:00.200,yeah,
629,7,2,00:39:11.100,00:39:12.000,00:00:00.900,,so you can just all right
630,7,2,00:39:12.500,00:39:15.500,00:00:03.000,,and then if you add seventeen to this side
631,7,2,00:39:15.500,00:39:16.800,00:00:01.300,,what's it get us
632,7,2,00:39:22.200,00:39:23.000,00:00:00.800,,eighty
633,7,2,00:39:24.500,00:39:26.000,00:00:01.500,what you said eighty,
634,7,2,00:39:26.000,00:39:27.100,00:00:01.100,,yeah eighty
635,7,2,00:39:27.100,00:39:35.300,00:00:08.200,,so right now it's negative negative three over y
636,7,2,00:39:37.000,00:39:38.100,00:00:01.100,did you hear that,
637,7,2,00:39:38.700,00:39:39.700,00:00:01.000,,what was that
638,7,2,00:39:40.100,00:39:41.000,00:00:00.900,what,
639,7,2,00:39:41.700,00:39:43.100,00:00:01.400,,that like like what
640,7,2,00:39:44.600,00:39:45.200,00:00:00.600,I just burped,
641,7,2,00:39:45.500,00:39:48.000,00:00:02.500,,oh I did not hear that okay
642,7,2,00:39:47.200,00:39:48.600,00:00:01.400,okay good,
643,7,2,00:39:49.700,00:39:51.500,00:00:01.800,,so right now negative three
644,7,2,00:39:51.500,00:39:52.600,00:00:01.100,,we're not going to write it
645,7,2,00:39:52.900,00:39:56.700,00:00:03.800,,negative three over y equals pause filler eight
646,7,2,00:39:56.700,00:39:59.200,00:00:02.500,I can write with the back of the pen,
647,7,2,00:39:59.400,00:40:07.100,00:00:07.700,,so then what we're supposed to do is multiply
648,7,2,00:40:09.000,00:40:11.064,00:00:02.064,,I like this stuff on the bottom
649,7,2,00:40:12.600,00:40:15.500,00:00:02.900,,it's like try it
650,7,2,00:40:15.500,00:40:17.300,00:00:01.800,,it's like sweet but like sour
651,7,2,00:40:17.800,00:40:19.100,00:00:01.300,yeah I don't like sour things,
652,7,2,00:40:20.300,00:40:21.000,00:00:00.700,,you don't
653,7,2,00:40:22.400,00:40:25.270,00:00:02.870,,it's actually like really good okay
654,7,2,00:40:29.400,00:40:34.700,00:00:05.300,,so if we multiply each side by x then
655,7,2,00:40:35.800,00:40:37.000,00:00:01.200,,what's going to happen
656,7,2,00:40:40.600,00:40:41.500,00:00:00.900,(sfx),
657,7,2,00:40:41.500,00:40:45.800,00:00:04.300,,so if you multiply negative three over y not by x by y
658,7,2,00:40:46.100,00:40:49.700,00:00:03.600,,if we do negative three over y times y
659,7,2,00:40:49.900,00:40:51.000,00:00:01.100,,what's going to happen
660,7,2,00:40:53.700,00:40:55.300,00:00:01.600,,it's going to be gone
661,7,2,00:40:55.300,00:40:58.400,00:00:03.100,,the y is going to be gone
662,7,2,00:40:58.400,00:41:00.000,00:00:01.600,,it's going to fly away
663,7,2,00:40:58.400,00:41:01.400,00:00:03.000,I was kidding there (laughter),
664,7,2,00:41:01.400,00:41:03.100,00:00:01.700,,so here write down negative three
665,7,2,00:41:03.100,00:41:07.300,00:00:04.200,,because if we so if we do negative y times negative three over y
666,7,2,00:41:07.500,00:41:09.600,00:00:02.100,,so just write negative three
667,7,2,00:41:09.700,00:41:14.000,00:00:04.300,,and then just write eighty times y
668,7,2,00:41:14.500,00:41:15.800,00:00:01.300,,and then that's our thing
669,7,2,00:41:16.300,00:41:17.300,00:00:01.000,,wait no it's not
670,7,2,00:41:17.300,00:41:18.000,00:00:00.700,,wait yes it is
671,7,2,00:41:18.000,00:41:18.800,00:00:00.800,,wait no it's not
672,7,2,00:41:18.800,00:41:19.700,00:00:00.900,,no it's not
673,7,2,00:41:19.800,00:41:20.800,00:00:01.000,,I got this
674,7,2,00:41:20.800,00:41:22.500,00:00:01.700,,okay I was like no it's not
675,7,2,00:41:22.500,00:41:24.000,00:00:01.500,,it's going to be so
676,7,2,00:41:24.000,00:41:28.000,00:00:04.000,,right now this is not not the mechanical pencil
677,7,2,00:41:28.000,00:41:35.900,00:00:07.900,,so right now it's negative three equals
678,7,2,00:41:36.100,00:41:41.400,00:00:05.300,,negative three equals eighty eighty x eighty y
679,7,2,00:41:41.400,00:41:44.700,00:00:03.300,,and then what we do is we divide
680,7,2,00:41:45.100,00:41:47.500,00:00:02.400,,if we want to get y alone what do we do
681,7,2,00:41:49.900,00:41:52.800,00:00:02.900,you have to subtract or add,
682,7,2,00:41:53.000,00:41:56.600,00:00:03.600,,no you have to divide
683,7,2,00:41:57.200,00:41:58.100,00:00:00.900,what you said,
684,7,2,00:41:58.700,00:41:59.100,00:00:00.400,,yeah
685,7,2,00:41:59.400,00:42:05.200,00:00:05.800,,so then what we're going to so we have negative three equals eighty pause filler y
686,7,2,00:42:05.300,00:42:07.700,00:00:02.400,,so then we're going to divide by eighty on each side
687,7,2,00:42:08.200,00:42:14.100,00:00:05.900,,and so it's going to be negative pause filler three over eighty
688,7,2,00:42:14.200,00:42:16.100,00:00:01.900,,because if we're dividing that
689,7,2,00:42:16.100,00:42:19.500,00:00:03.400,,and then since we divided the other side by eighty
690,7,2,00:42:20.100,00:42:23.700,00:00:03.600,,it's going to be pause filler it's just going to be y now
691,7,2,00:42:24.600,00:42:26.700,00:00:02.100,,so what's it all equal
692,7,2,00:42:29.800,00:42:30.700,00:00:00.900,you stumped me,
693,7,2,00:42:31.500,00:42:32.400,00:00:00.900,,I stumped you
694,7,2,00:42:33.300,00:42:34.800,00:00:01.500,I have no idea where you are,
695,7,2,00:42:35.700,00:42:38.300,00:00:02.600,,okay let me explain everything we did okay
696,7,2,00:42:39.300,00:42:41.700,00:00:02.400,,just like I don't feel like writing the whole thing again
697,7,2,00:42:41.700,00:42:43.600,00:00:01.900,,but I'll just explain it so
698,7,2,00:42:43.700,00:42:45.000,00:00:01.300,wait hold on are we here,
699,7,2,00:42:46.100,00:42:48.200,00:00:02.100,,here do you want me to just go from the very beginning
700,7,2,00:42:49.400,00:42:49.800,00:00:00.400,no,
701,7,2,00:42:50.500,00:42:52.700,00:00:02.200,,where did you get lost
702,7,2,00:42:55.700,00:42:57.580,00:00:01.880,all of the writing,
703,7,2,00:42:59.300,00:43:00.000,00:00:00.700,I can't,
704,7,2,00:43:01.000,00:43:06.200,00:00:05.200,,okay so what we did first is we added eighteen to each side
705,7,2,00:43:06.800,00:43:07.500,00:00:00.700,,you know that right
706,7,2,00:43:08.000,00:43:08.300,00:00:00.300,uh-huh,
707,7,2,00:43:10.000,00:43:13.700,00:00:03.700,,so then on the left side we have negative three over y
708,7,2,00:43:13.700,00:43:16.700,00:00:03.000,,and then on the other side we had eighty
709,7,2,00:43:16.700,00:43:21.100,00:00:04.400,,because we added to the seventeen cancelled out yeah
710,7,2,00:43:21.100,00:43:29.400,00:00:08.300,,and then what we did is we divided each side by y yeah
711,7,2,00:43:29.800,00:43:34.700,00:00:04.900,,and then what happened is the negative three over y just became negative three
712,7,2,00:43:34.700,00:43:38.200,00:00:03.500,,and six and eighty became eighty times y
713,7,2,00:43:38.800,00:43:42.700,00:00:03.900,,so at this point it was negative three equals eighty times y
714,7,2,00:43:43.400,00:43:49.000,00:00:05.600,,and then what happened was we divided so we had pause filler
715,7,2,00:43:49.000,00:43:50.500,00:00:01.500,,let me just write this out
716,7,2,00:43:51.000,00:43:52.400,00:00:01.400,,so we had negative three
717,7,2,00:43:52.400,00:44:00.200,00:00:07.800,,since pause filler negative three equals eighty times y
718,7,2,00:44:01.800,00:44:03.300,00:00:01.500,,oh my gosh
719,7,2,00:44:04.000,00:44:04.800,00:00:00.800,,eighty times y
720,7,2,00:44:04.800,00:44:07.700,00:00:02.900,,let's just pretend that says eighty times y okay
721,7,2,00:44:08.200,00:44:13.100,00:00:04.900,,because we got there because we had multiplied times y on each side
722,7,2,00:44:13.100,00:44:15.700,00:00:02.600,,and it became negative three equals eighty y
723,7,2,00:44:15.800,00:44:23.200,00:00:07.400,,you get that
724,7,2,00:44:22.500,00:44:23.500,00:00:01.000,hold up,
725,7,2,00:44:24.500,00:44:25.700,00:00:01.200,go back to eighty times y,
726,7,2,00:44:25.700,00:44:26.900,00:00:01.200,what does it equal,
727,7,2,00:44:28.500,00:44:30.200,00:00:01.700,,we don't do eighty times y
728,7,2,00:44:30.600,00:44:32.400,00:00:01.800,,what we do next is the fourth like
729,7,2,00:44:32.800,00:44:34.400,00:00:01.600,,we want to get y alone
730,7,2,00:44:34.400,00:44:36.200,00:00:01.800,,and right now y is with eighty
731,7,2,00:44:36.200,00:44:37.500,00:00:01.300,,so you have to divide
732,7,2,00:44:37.700,00:44:43.500,00:00:05.800,,if you do eighty if eighty times y if you do eighty times y divided by eight
733,7,2,00:44:43.500,00:44:45.600,00:00:02.100,,it just becomes y
734,7,2,00:44:45.600,00:44:49.500,00:00:03.900,,because the eighty divided eighty just cancels out and then becomes y
735,7,2,00:44:49.700,00:44:51.800,00:00:02.100,,so you get that
736,7,2,00:44:51.800,00:44:54.340,00:00:02.540,yeah so now it's just y,
737,7,2,00:44:55.400,00:44:57.200,00:00:01.800,,yeah so it's just y on the right side
738,7,2,00:44:57.200,00:45:01.500,00:00:04.300,,and then we also have to do pause filler divide eighty on the other side
739,7,2,00:45:01.500,00:45:03.300,00:00:01.800,,so then it's just negative three divided by eighty
740,7,2,00:45:03.300,00:45:05.100,00:00:01.800,,so the final thing do you
741,7,2,00:45:05.200,00:45:05.900,00:00:00.700,,what is it
742,7,2,00:45:08.500,00:45:10.200,00:00:01.700,,negative three over
743,7,2,00:45:12.600,00:45:14.600,00:00:02.000,I can't do math that fast,
744,7,2,00:45:12.710,00:45:13.290,00:00:00.580,,eighty
745,7,2,00:45:16.600,00:45:18.300,00:00:01.700,,no because like what I just said
746,7,2,00:45:18.300,00:45:21.000,00:00:02.700,,it's negative three over eighty equals y
747,7,2,00:45:22.400,00:45:24.700,00:00:02.300,,oh I've been using the wrong side
748,7,2,00:45:24.900,00:45:27.300,00:00:02.400,,I was using the other side
749,7,2,00:45:27.300,00:45:29.200,00:00:01.900,,I probably looked like an idiot
750,7,2,00:45:32.000,00:45:34.000,00:00:02.000,,okay do you want to go onto the next one
751,7,2,00:45:41.600,00:45:45.000,00:00:03.400,,how do you like get that away (laughter)
752,7,2,00:45:45.000,00:45:48.100,00:00:03.100,,okay do you know what to do now
753,7,2,00:45:48.700,00:45:52.400,00:00:03.700,we have to subtract forty fifty-four sorry pause filler (laughter),
754,7,2,00:45:53.900,00:45:55.500,00:00:01.600,,I just like dropped it
755,7,2,00:45:56.300,00:45:57.600,00:00:01.300,,why is that scaring me
756,7,2,00:45:57.600,00:45:58.700,00:00:01.100,,it's like I'm going to break it
757,7,2,00:45:58.700,00:45:59.900,00:00:01.200,,okay I'm not going to do that
758,7,2,00:45:59.900,00:46:05.500,00:00:05.600,,yeah so write that down subtract fifty-four from each side
759,7,2,00:46:16.500,00:46:20.200,00:00:03.700,,I just moved my little box where like I am
760,7,2,00:46:20.200,00:46:21.000,00:00:00.800,,I just moved it
761,7,2,00:46:22.200,00:46:23.800,00:00:01.600,,I don't remember like mess up
762,7,2,00:46:23.800,00:46:25.300,00:00:01.500,,oh my gosh
763,7,2,00:46:26.000,00:46:27.000,00:00:01.000,,there we go okay
764,7,2,00:46:29.400,00:46:33.800,00:00:04.400,,so you just subtract fifty-four from each side
765,7,2,00:46:33.800,00:46:36.700,00:00:02.900,,because then you'll get rid of the fifty-four on the one side
766,7,2,00:46:49.700,00:46:53.200,00:00:03.500,,okay so then it's just yeah four over k equals
767,7,2,00:46:53.200,00:46:59.300,00:00:06.100,,and then what is one hundred sixteen minus fifty-four
768,7,2,00:47:06.000,00:47:07.400,00:00:01.400,,sixty-two
769,7,2,00:47:07.000,00:47:08.900,00:00:01.900,I was about to say that,
770,7,2,00:47:11.000,00:47:17.000,00:00:06.000,,okay so right now yeah so then what we have to do is
771,7,2,00:47:21.300,00:47:22.580,00:00:01.280,,what do you think we have to do
772,7,2,00:47:26.500,00:47:27.900,00:00:01.400,,just what we have to do
773,7,2,00:47:27.900,00:47:29.600,00:00:01.700,,how do we get the four all alone
774,7,2,00:47:31.200,00:47:31.800,00:00:00.600,the what,
775,7,2,00:47:32.500,00:47:32.900,00:00:00.400,,the four
776,7,2,00:47:32.900,00:47:34.000,00:00:01.100,,how do you get the four alone
777,7,2,00:47:34.000,00:47:36.500,00:00:02.500,oh I was about to be like I don't get it,
778,7,2,00:47:36.500,00:47:38.300,00:00:01.800,okay so you have to divide,
779,7,2,00:47:38.300,00:47:40.200,00:00:01.900,,you have to multiply
780,7,2,00:47:41.500,00:47:42.600,00:00:01.100,whatever same thing,
781,7,2,00:47:43.200,00:47:44.000,00:00:00.800,pause filler okay,
782,7,2,00:47:44.100,00:47:48.900,00:00:04.800,,so you have to do yeah so multiply k by each side
783,7,2,00:47:49.600,00:47:51.400,00:00:01.800,,so then on the left side
784,7,2,00:47:49.900,00:47:52.400,00:00:02.500,that was really weird oh my gosh,
785,7,2,00:47:54.800,00:47:55.700,00:00:00.900,,it looks like a highlighter
786,7,2,00:47:56.500,00:47:57.000,00:00:00.500,it is,
787,7,2,00:47:57.000,00:47:58.800,00:00:01.800,but did you see what it looked like,
788,7,2,00:48:00.200,00:48:00.700,00:00:00.500,,no
789,7,2,00:48:01.400,00:48:01.800,00:00:00.400,good,
790,7,2,00:48:04.900,00:48:05.500,00:00:00.600,,okay
791,7,2,00:48:07.700,00:48:13.700,00:00:06.000,,so if we multiply k to each side we'll get four all alone
792,7,2,00:48:13.700,00:48:15.400,00:00:01.700,,and then you'll have sixty-two k
793,7,2,00:48:15.400,00:48:17.000,00:00:01.600,,so can you write that down
794,7,2,00:48:24.600,00:48:25.400,00:00:00.800,,equals four
795,7,2,00:48:32.500,00:48:33.900,00:00:01.400,,okay now we're not done yet
796,7,2,00:48:34.700,00:48:36.000,00:00:01.300,,what do we have to do
797,7,2,00:48:36.600,00:48:37.300,00:00:00.700,divide it,
798,7,2,00:48:38.000,00:48:39.800,00:00:01.800,I have no idea,
799,7,2,00:48:40.800,00:48:43.200,00:00:02.400,,wait oh one minute let me check
800,7,2,00:48:43.200,00:48:45.000,00:00:01.800,,yeah you're right divide it
801,7,2,00:48:45.100,00:48:49.100,00:00:04.000,,wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
802,7,2,00:48:49.400,00:48:50.000,00:00:00.600,,yeah
803,7,2,00:48:50.000,00:48:52.600,00:00:02.600,,but what do you think we have to divide it by
804,7,2,00:49:00.800,00:49:02.200,00:00:01.400,,guess what we have to divide it by
805,7,2,00:49:03.500,00:49:03.900,00:00:00.400,four,
806,7,2,00:49:04.100,00:49:06.000,00:00:01.900,,you can just write it as a fraction
807,7,2,00:49:06.000,00:49:07.300,00:00:01.300,,you don't have to actually do the thing
808,7,2,00:49:08.500,00:49:09.000,00:00:00.500,yes I do,
809,7,2,00:49:10.000,00:49:11.380,00:00:01.380,,okay if you want to
810,7,2,00:49:11.380,00:49:18.500,00:00:07.120,,so then at the end it all just equals k equals four divided by sixty-two
811,7,2,00:49:19.400,00:49:20.500,00:00:01.100,,okay
812,7,2,00:49:20.700,00:49:21.500,00:00:00.800,okay,
813,7,2,00:49:34.200,00:49:36.300,00:00:02.100,,all right did you get it
814,7,2,00:49:36.700,00:49:37.300,00:00:00.600,almost,
815,7,2,00:49:53.800,00:49:54.800,00:00:01.000,,look at me
816,7,2,00:49:54.800,00:49:59.000,00:00:04.200,,this is my short this is me as a boy
817,7,2,00:49:59.800,00:50:00.900,00:00:01.100,lovely,
818,7,2,00:50:01.800,00:50:03.000,00:00:01.200,,alright okay
819,7,2,00:50:04.600,00:50:06.700,00:00:02.100,,did you figure out what it was is it fifteen point
820,7,2,00:50:06.500,00:50:07.600,00:00:01.100,fifteen point five,
821,7,2,00:50:07.700,00:50:11.100,00:00:03.400,,all right so then fifteen point five equals k
822,7,2,00:50:13.800,00:50:14.600,00:00:00.800,,what was that
823,7,2,00:50:15.580,00:50:16.800,00:00:01.220,my watch,
824,7,2,00:50:15.800,00:50:17.000,00:00:01.200,,did you hear that
825,7,2,00:50:17.000,00:50:18.100,00:00:01.100,it was my watch,
826,7,2,00:50:21.000,00:50:23.600,00:00:02.600,,(laughter) I'll draw another fancy k
827,7,2,00:50:23.600,00:50:24.800,00:00:01.200,,oh or not
828,7,2,00:50:25.700,00:50:27.600,00:00:01.900,,okay one minute
829,7,2,00:50:27.600,00:50:30.800,00:00:03.200,,let me figure out what we have to do for this just so I can pause filler
830,7,2,00:50:32.000,00:50:32.300,00:00:00.300,,okay
831,7,2,00:50:34.900,00:50:35.900,00:00:01.000,,yeah okay
832,7,2,00:50:35.900,00:50:38.800,00:00:02.900,,I think I know (laughter)
833,7,2,00:50:40.700,00:50:42.400,00:00:01.700,,how do I get
834,7,2,00:50:43.100,00:50:45.700,00:00:02.600,well I think you have to subtract it,
835,7,2,00:50:48.000,00:50:48.900,00:00:00.900,,no no no (laughter)
836,7,2,00:50:48.900,00:50:50.800,00:00:01.900,well then it's multiply or addition,
837,7,2,00:50:50.800,00:50:54.900,00:00:04.100,,yeah how do we get the negative fourteen all alone
838,7,2,00:50:57.100,00:50:59.500,00:00:02.400,you have to subtract it by y,
839,7,2,00:50:59.500,00:51:00.800,00:00:01.300,,multiply multiply
840,7,2,00:51:00.800,00:51:01.500,00:00:00.700,whatever,
841,7,2,00:51:02.300,00:51:03.300,00:00:01.000,multiply by y,
842,7,2,00:51:03.800,00:51:05.800,00:00:02.000,,so you're going to wait
843,7,2,00:51:07.300,00:51:10.000,00:00:02.700,,oh that feels good to like take them off
844,7,2,00:51:10.900,00:51:11.400,00:00:00.500,,okay
845,7,2,00:51:12.200,00:51:15.700,00:00:03.500,,that's the people at school would be like put their heads (inaudible)
846,7,2,00:51:16.100,00:51:21.800,00:00:05.700,,okay so if we did pause filler negative fourteen over y times y
847,7,2,00:51:21.800,00:51:24.000,00:00:02.200,,that's going to just equal negative fourteen
848,7,2,00:51:24.000,00:51:25.300,00:00:01.300,,do you want to write that down
849,7,2,00:51:27.700,00:51:30.000,00:00:02.300,,here I'll like write a little arrow
850,7,2,00:51:33.900,00:51:35.600,00:00:01.700,,why is this computer so slow
851,7,2,00:51:37.000,00:51:49.200,00:00:12.200,,okay so then it's just going to be it's two hundred ten pause filler times y is going to equal negative fourteen
852,7,2,00:51:54.000,00:51:55.700,00:00:01.700,,do you get that
853,7,2,00:51:56.400,00:51:56.700,00:00:00.300,yeah,
854,7,2,00:51:58.300,00:52:03.900,00:00:05.600,,okay so now that we have two hundred ten times y equals fourteen
855,7,2,00:52:04.400,00:52:06.700,00:00:02.300,,we just have to make y alone
856,7,2,00:52:07.800,00:52:13.000,00:00:05.200,so then we have to do y plus y or subtraction,
857,7,2,00:52:13.400,00:52:14.000,00:00:00.600,,division
858,7,2,00:52:14.000,00:52:17.800,00:00:03.800,,we have to divide two hundred ten y divided by two hundred ten
859,7,2,00:52:17.800,00:52:20.100,00:00:02.300,,because then it will leave y alone
860,7,2,00:52:20.100,00:52:21.200,00:00:01.100,,do you get that
861,7,2,00:52:22.500,00:52:25.000,00:00:02.500,,so oh my god you just disappeared
862,7,2,00:52:26.400,00:52:27.200,00:00:00.800,,oh there you are
863,7,2,00:52:27.200,00:52:28.300,00:00:01.100,,it like you like disappeared
864,7,2,00:52:28.300,00:52:30.500,00:00:02.200,,like the screen went like blue like
865,7,2,00:52:30.500,00:52:30.700,00:00:00.200,,not blue
866,7,2,00:52:30.700,00:52:32.800,00:00:02.100,,but like it was just like a home screen
867,7,2,00:52:32.800,00:52:37.000,00:00:04.200,,and it was just like I was like what did I do okay pause filler
868,7,2,00:52:39.800,00:52:42.000,00:00:02.200,,so what's it going to do
869,7,2,00:52:42.600,00:52:47.400,00:00:04.800,,it's two hundred ten y divided by two hundred ten
870,7,2,00:52:48.500,00:52:49.900,00:00:01.400,,so that's just going to be y
871,7,2,00:52:49.900,00:52:53.600,00:00:03.700,,and then what's going to happen to the negative fourteen
872,7,2,00:52:55.900,00:52:57.200,00:00:01.300,is that the answer,
873,7,2,00:52:57.800,00:52:58.200,00:00:00.400,,yeah
874,7,2,00:52:59.200,00:52:59.600,00:00:00.400,okay (laughter),
875,7,2,00:53:00.100,00:53:02.600,00:00:02.500,,so what's the full answer
876,7,2,00:53:03.300,00:53:04.800,00:00:01.500,y equals negative fourteen,
877,7,2,00:53:05.500,00:53:06.200,00:00:00.700,,over
878,7,2,00:53:07.700,00:53:09.800,00:00:02.100,y I have no idea,
879,7,2,00:53:10.700,00:53:11.300,00:00:00.600,,two hundred ten
880,7,2,00:53:12.100,00:53:20.900,00:00:08.800,,because if we have to divide two hundred ten y pause filler by two hundred ten you also have to do that to the other side
881,7,2,00:53:20.900,00:53:22.500,00:00:01.600,,because since we're trying to get y alone
882,7,2,00:53:22.800,00:53:26.500,00:00:03.700,,so we had to divide two hundred ten to each side
883,7,2,00:53:26.800,00:53:28.900,00:00:02.100,,so then the other side just became y
884,7,2,00:53:28.900,00:53:34.200,00:00:05.300,,and the other side is now negative fourteen divided by two hundred ten
885,7,2,00:53:36.900,00:53:38.300,00:00:01.400,,you got it
886,7,2,00:53:38.300,00:53:40.600,00:00:02.300,,all right want to go to the next one
887,7,2,00:53:40.600,00:53:41.400,00:00:00.800,,I think they might be coming
888,7,2,00:53:41.400,00:53:41.900,00:00:00.500,,yeah they're coming
889,7,2,00:53:41.900,00:53:43.600,00:00:01.700,,wait are they coming yeah
890,7,2,00:53:45.000,00:53:47.000,00:00:02.000,,no okay pause filler
891,7,2,00:53:47.200,00:53:48.600,00:00:01.400,,let's go to the next one
892,7,2,00:53:54.100,00:53:57.700,00:00:03.600,,I did it like the first time I
893,7,2,00:53:58.100,00:53:59.300,00:00:01.200,actually that was me,
894,7,2,00:53:59.300,00:54:03.200,00:00:03.900,,oh that was oh wait maybe we just both pressed it at the same time
895,7,2,00:54:03.200,00:54:04.800,00:00:01.600,,okay so for this one you have to oh
896,7,2,00:54:09.000,00:54:10.000,00:00:01.000,,all right
897,7,2,00:54:32.300,00:54:33.400,00:00:01.100,,that was fifty-five
898,7,2,00:54:49.000,00:54:51.600,00:00:02.600,,can you believe it was fifty-five minutes
899,7,2,00:54:51.600,00:54:52.800,00:00:01.200,,it's like almost one hour like
900,7,2,00:54:53.900,00:54:55.100,00:00:01.200,,all right
