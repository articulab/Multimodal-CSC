2,11,2,00:01:15.580,00:01:20.430,00:00:04.850,seems like this can be a little bit more of a challenge this time yeah seems like this can be a little bit more of a challenge this time,
3,11,2,00:01:21.400,00:01:22.990,00:00:01.590,,yeah they added multiplication (sfx)
4,11,2,00:01:26.730,00:01:29.380,00:00:02.650,yeah wait I think they had multiplication last time,
5,11,2,00:01:30.110,00:01:31.490,00:00:01.380,,not with the variable (inaudible) variable
6,11,2,00:01:35.310,00:01:39.430,00:00:04.120,yeah I guess so yeah subtraction with variable too,
7,11,2,00:01:42.690,00:01:44.740,00:00:02.050,,yeah it makes up more
8,11,2,00:01:47.980,00:01:51.111,00:00:03.131,did you have finals at Colfax or you're just like done,

27,11,2,00:02:57.200,00:02:57.920,00:00:00.720,yeah he's great ,
28,11,2,00:02:57.375,00:02:59.405,00:00:02.030,,(inaudible) all the best well I certainly got all the guys 
29,11,2,00:03:00.655,00:03:05.090,00:00:04.435,,I met all of the guys (inaudible) 
30,11,2,00:03:16.650,00:03:17.200,00:00:00.550,someone just walked in ,
31,11,2,00:03:21.720,00:03:22.520,00:00:00.800,,I don't know what that is 
32,11,2,00:03:31.725,00:03:32.495,00:00:00.770,how was your weekend ,
33,11,2,00:03:34.005,00:03:34.515,00:00:00.510,,good it was good 
34,11,2,00:03:35.805,00:03:36.275,00:00:00.470,,it was very good 
35,11,2,00:03:37.210,00:03:39.180,00:00:01.970,superhot up very nice though ,
36,11,2,00:03:39.450,00:03:42.820,00:00:03.370,,it's very hot hot I went to (inaudible) I guess that was what we did 
37,11,2,00:03:44.270,00:03:46.040,00:00:01.770,nice sounds fun ,
38,11,2,00:03:45.860,00:03:47.560,00:00:01.700,,first time everything went 
39,11,2,00:03:49.040,00:03:52.430,00:00:03.390,yeah one summer I got at Season Pass ,
40,11,2,00:03:52.560,00:03:54.680,00:00:02.120,I went like eight time that summer ,
41,11,2,00:03:54.820,00:03:55.530,00:00:00.710,it was insane ,
42,11,2,00:03:57.065,00:03:58.365,00:00:01.300,,it could be just on like every day 
43,11,2,00:04:00.100,00:04:03.510,00:00:03.410,yeah well it was a little bit of a challenge to get right there every day ,
44,11,2,00:04:05.320,00:04:09.910,00:00:04.590,and sometimes it's pause filler yes it was fun ,
45,11,2,00:04:12.295,00:04:12.815,00:00:00.520,,did you know it would be 
46,11,2,00:04:15.940,00:04:16.520,00:00:00.580,it wasn't even that much money ,
47,11,2,00:04:17.595,00:04:19.790,00:00:02.195,I think it was like sixty dollars or fifty ,
48,11,2,00:04:21.320,00:04:21.810,00:00:00.490,I think it was sixty ,
49,11,2,00:04:23.040,00:04:23.360,00:00:00.320,,all Season Pass 
50,11,2,00:04:24.535,00:04:26.060,00:00:01.525,but they're doing it anymore ,
51,11,2,00:04:26.080,00:04:29.140,00:00:03.060,and I could only use the pass on weekdays though so ,
52,11,2,00:04:30.440,00:04:30.980,00:00:00.540,,oh on weekends because weekends (inaudible) very 
53,11,2,00:04:36.200,00:04:40.338,00:00:04.138,on the weekdays the lines were relatively short  so it was awesome ,
54,11,2,00:04:42.790,00:04:45.380,00:00:02.590,,well the lines were just overall really short meaning it was going to be on Memorial Day 
55,11,2,00:04:50.120,00:04:50.820,00:00:00.700,that makes sense yeah ,
56,11,2,00:05:20.010,00:05:22.030,00:00:02.020,,is this shift control L and pan 
57,11,2,00:05:22.495,00:05:24.370,00:00:01.875,,what does pan mean 
58,11,2,00:05:26.420,00:05:29.010,00:00:02.590,,does shift control (inaudible) wait a minute I found you touching these ones 
59,11,2,00:05:36.855,00:05:40.015,00:00:03.160,,the last time I got curious I ruined everything 
60,11,2,00:06:53.830,00:06:54.230,00:00:00.400,,so there we go 
61,11,2,00:07:34.860,00:07:35.720,00:00:00.860,sweet are we going to start ,
62,11,2,00:07:37.550,00:07:41.600,00:00:04.050,all righty let's get this started ,
63,11,2,00:07:41.735,00:07:42.415,00:00:00.680,,so we are okay all right click 
64,11,2,00:07:44.207,00:07:45.357,00:00:01.150,,yup I guess they are 
65,11,2,00:07:45.990,00:07:50.640,00:00:04.650,,all right we got three o seven times x equals forty 
66,11,2,00:07:50.840,00:07:54.300,00:00:03.460,,well I guess first thing we would do is pause filler multiply it by seven 
67,11,2,00:07:55.815,00:08:01.610,00:00:05.795,,you get three x equals pause filler forty divided or times seven well 
68,11,2,00:08:02.110,00:08:07.210,00:00:05.100,,forty time seven pause filler seven times zero is 
69,11,2,00:08:06.560,00:08:07.520,00:00:00.960,that's a long way to do it ,
70,11,2,00:08:07.875,00:08:09.055,00:00:01.180,that would be a longer way ,
71,11,2,00:08:11.370,00:08:14.240,00:00:02.870,,is pause filler what is four times seven
72,11,2,00:08:14.310,00:08:17.040,00:00:02.730,,it's forty-eight right two hundred eighty there magic 
73,11,2,00:08:17.130,00:08:19.870,00:00:02.740,,and then we just divide this by three 
74,11,2,00:08:21.145,00:08:22.165,00:00:01.020,and then you get your answer ,
75,11,2,00:08:22.620,00:08:26.820,00:00:04.200,,and that means x equals pause filler well pause filler 
76,11,2,00:08:30.535,00:08:31.235,00:00:00.700,well but we could do it differently ,
77,11,2,00:08:31.730,00:08:33.920,00:00:02.190,yeah we could do this like this ,
78,11,2,00:08:33.940,00:08:37.640,00:00:03.700,,yeah let's just do it like pause filler thirty-eight and 
79,11,2,00:08:38.540,00:08:39.160,00:00:00.620,one division ,
80,11,2,00:08:39.545,00:08:43.495,00:00:03.950,,so zero goes into that zero or twenty-eight 
81,11,2,00:08:44.425,00:08:47.840,00:00:03.415,, pause filler like seven eight or eight time three twenty-four
82,11,2,00:08:49.210,00:08:52.690,00:00:03.480,,what's nine times three twenty-seven twenty-seven 
83,11,2,00:08:52.790,00:08:55.240,00:00:02.450,,that would be it nine 
84,11,2,00:08:55.370,00:08:56.800,00:00:01.430,,and we get twenty-seven 
85,11,2,00:08:56.865,00:08:57.555,00:00:00.690,,so we get ten 
86,11,2,00:08:58.890,00:09:00.310,00:00:01.420,and then that would be one ,
87,11,2,00:08:58.960,00:09:03.210,00:00:04.250,,so we get pause filler plus three right yeah three 
88,11,2,00:09:05.745,00:09:08.715,00:00:02.970,,and then that would be one 
89,11,2,00:09:08.865,00:09:11.835,00:00:02.970,,so it would be nine three by three three three three three equals 
90,11,2,00:09:13.365,00:09:14.545,00:00:01.180,that's what x would equal ,
91,11,2,00:09:14.860,00:09:15.580,00:00:00.720,I'm pretty sure ,
92,11,2,00:09:15.685,00:09:18.340,00:00:02.655,,I can do three point three three three now 
93,11,2,00:09:18.595,00:09:21.550,00:00:02.955,,let's just say we're up ten all right yeah 
94,11,2,00:09:22.625,00:09:27.350,00:00:04.725,good all right for the next one let's just divide both sides by the pause filler the opposite of this ,
95,11,2,00:09:28.460,00:09:31.890,00:00:03.430,pause filler the opposite of this,
96,11,2,00:09:32.232,00:09:33.532,00:00:01.300,so like let's just like ,
97,11,2,00:09:33.767,00:09:35.167,00:00:01.400,I mean multiply each side ,
98,11,2,00:09:35.292,00:09:37.560,00:00:02.268,so like we'll do fourteen,
99,11,2,00:09:40.170,00:09:40.570,00:00:00.400,times,
100,11,2,00:09:41.247,00:09:43.167,00:00:01.920,I want to make a dot dot make a dot ,
101,11,2,00:09:44.090,00:09:47.140,00:00:03.050,there we go times like eight over three ,
102,11,2,00:09:48.602,00:09:49.912,00:00:01.310,,eight over three that's the reciprocal 
103,11,2,00:09:50.792,00:09:53.862,00:00:03.070,yeah so that's why you just do the reciprocal of the problem and then ,
104,11,2,00:09:54.670,00:09:59.140,00:00:04.470,,well fourteen time eight over three I don't understand how that would work exactly 
105,11,2,00:09:59.752,00:10:02.222,00:00:02.470,well I mean here let's just do this right ,
106,11,2,00:10:02.592,00:10:03.662,00:00:01.070,and then we'll just plug ,
107,11,2,00:10:03.282,00:10:04.172,00:00:00.890,,oh yeah you mean multiplying 
108,11,2,00:10:04.782,00:10:06.012,00:00:01.230,yeah you multiply not divide ,
109,11,2,00:10:06.250,00:10:07.560,00:00:01.310,,yeah okay well you're 
110,11,2,00:10:07.952,00:10:09.042,00:00:01.090,it was a dot it wasn't working though ,
111,11,2,00:10:09.212,00:10:10.610,00:00:01.398,,yeah I see you're multiplying 
112,11,2,00:10:10.750,00:10:16.990,00:00:06.240,,this is to represent the division okay yeah pause filler well this just getting cross multiplied yet 
113,11,2,00:10:17.530,00:10:20.947,00:00:03.417,,so we'll just have to do fourteen time eight fourteen times eight 
114,11,2,00:10:21.637,00:10:24.447,00:00:02.810,,so eight times four is twenty-four right takes out yeah no no no 
115,11,2,00:10:27.310,00:10:30.870,00:00:03.560,,eight time four is thirty-two and then 
116,11,2,00:10:32.297,00:10:33.527,00:00:01.230,,two and three 
117,11,2,00:10:34.830,00:10:35.710,00:00:00.880,,so it would be one one 
118,11,2,00:10:36.412,00:10:37.292,00:00:00.880,so one hundred and one ,
119,11,2,00:10:38.037,00:10:39.357,00:00:01.320,,a hundred and twelve 
120,11,2,00:10:39.247,00:10:40.117,00:00:00.870,yeah a hundred and twelve ,
121,11,2,00:10:41.727,00:10:49.170,00:00:07.443,,a hundred twelve over three pause filler equals k and pause filler 
122,11,2,00:10:50.230,00:10:52.450,00:00:02.220,,well we'd simplify that or 
123,11,2,00:10:52.937,00:10:53.497,00:00:00.560,can we ,
124,11,2,00:10:53.972,00:10:57.332,00:00:03.360,,I mean I'm sure we can we just have to get it to prime that right 
125,11,2,00:10:58.307,00:10:59.167,00:00:00.860,that should be the exact ,
126,11,2,00:10:59.092,00:11:00.682,00:00:01.590,,I'm sure we're good yeah and back that to simplify 
127,11,2,00:11:02.652,00:11:03.892,00:00:01.240,,and we can get it so yeah 
128,11,2,00:11:03.797,00:11:08.297,00:00:04.500,yeah wait this three can go into twelve so we four by hundred ,
129,11,2,00:11:10.352,00:11:11.292,00:00:00.940,,well no no 
130,11,2,00:11:11.477,00:11:16.380,00:00:04.903,,let's see if both can be prime factorized pause filler so twelve 
131,11,2,00:11:16.992,00:11:20.840,00:00:03.848,,I mean one one two divided by 
132,11,2,00:11:21.037,00:11:22.087,00:00:01.050,three goes into twelve ,
133,11,2,00:11:22.950,00:11:24.090,00:00:01.140,three does not go into a hundred ,
134,11,2,00:11:26.762,00:11:29.192,00:00:02.430,,so let's just say that's a (inaudible) 
135,11,2,00:11:31.040,00:11:34.260,00:00:03.220,,I can get it all right oh plus thirteen 
136,11,2,00:11:35.830,00:11:37.620,00:00:01.790,remember plus thirteen so what can you do about that ,
137,11,2,00:11:38.340,00:11:40.630,00:00:02.290,,yeah subtract the thirteen 
138,11,2,00:11:41.580,00:11:44.020,00:00:02.440,,and then what's forty-four minus thirteen would be pause filler 
139,11,2,00:11:45.967,00:11:48.657,00:00:02.690,,let's just say one thirty-one okay whatever so 
140,11,2,00:11:50.110,00:11:53.920,00:00:03.810,and then let's just multiply the reciprocal of one half ,
141,11,2,00:11:54.140,00:11:57.920,00:00:03.780,,okay pause filler x equals thirty-one okay 
142,11,2,00:11:57.550,00:11:58.810,00:00:01.260,so it means the reciprocal of that ,
143,11,2,00:11:59.730,00:12:00.150,00:00:00.420,,two
144,11,2,00:12:00.690,00:12:01.250,00:00:00.560,so and let's just move yeah ,
145,11,2,00:12:02.280,00:12:08.010,00:00:05.730,,thirteen over one time thirty-one over one 
146,11,2,00:12:09.902,00:12:11.940,00:00:02.038,you just do two times thirty-one ,
147,11,2,00:12:15.587,00:12:16.837,00:00:01.250,,wait no no no 
148,11,2,00:12:16.892,00:12:18.142,00:00:01.250,yeah two times thirty-one is our answer ,
149,11,2,00:12:18.877,00:12:20.827,00:00:01.950,,no no on it would be thirty-one divided by two wait no no no oh wait no no 
150,11,2,00:12:22.587,00:12:23.437,00:00:00.850,,no you're right 
151,11,2,00:12:24.412,00:12:27.690,00:00:03.278,yeah x is being divided ,
152,11,2,00:12:28.420,00:12:32.810,00:00:04.390,,pause filler yeah so two times thirty-one is sixty-two sixty-two 
153,11,2,00:12:33.230,00:12:35.230,00:00:02.000,,x equals sixty-two
154,11,2,00:12:38.422,00:12:39.022,00:00:00.600,,I mean I'm not sure pause filler no 
155,11,2,00:12:40.290,00:12:41.300,00:00:01.010,,just look forward 
156,11,2,00:12:41.362,00:12:44.372,00:00:03.010,,thirty-one equals negative sixteen 
157,11,2,00:12:44.402,00:12:46.872,00:00:02.470,,oh I don't have to add sixteen here 
158,11,2,00:12:47.740,00:12:52.372,00:00:04.632,,so pause filler thirty-one plus sixteen is forty-seven 
159,11,2,00:12:53.251,00:12:54.041,00:00:00.790,,forty-seven equals three 
160,11,2,00:12:56.181,00:12:58.491,00:00:02.310,and then just do the reciprocal of that ,
161,11,2,00:12:58.116,00:12:59.306,00:00:01.190,,which is equals to half x is one over two 
162,11,2,00:13:03.096,00:13:05.766,00:00:02.670,,so I mean it's forty yeah seven times two 
163,11,2,00:13:09.906,00:13:10.946,00:00:01.040,no just do forty ,
164,11,2,00:13:11.281,00:13:13.931,00:00:02.650,this would be easier forty-seven times six over three the reciprocal ,
165,11,2,00:13:16.651,00:13:17.601,00:00:00.950,and just do that problem ,
166,11,2,00:13:17.801,00:13:18.481,00:00:00.680,pause filler because the reciprocal of that I mean yeah ,
167,11,2,00:13:18.686,00:13:19.686,00:00:01.000,,that's what we're doing but it's just times two because six over three is two wait why would it be two because six divided by three equals two 
168,11,2,00:13:27.501,00:13:29.741,00:00:02.240,okay wait yeah yeah yeah yeah that works ,
169,11,2,00:13:30.386,00:13:35.420,00:00:05.034,,yeah so forty-seven two equals pause filler ninety-four 
170,11,2,00:13:37.561,00:13:41.570,00:00:04.009,,ninety-four equals ninety-four to make it one wait no one 
171,11,2,00:13:43.090,00:13:45.820,00:00:02.730,yeah I don't understand why they do three over two because I think ,
172,11,2,00:13:45.981,00:13:46.801,00:00:00.820,,it's not equal 
173,11,2,00:13:46.946,00:13:47.536,00:00:00.590,because three I mean three over six ,
174,11,2,00:13:48.060,00:13:50.250,00:00:02.190,I mean my bad it's not ,
175,11,2,00:13:50.326,00:13:51.766,00:00:01.440,it's almost simple as four ,
176,11,2,00:13:52.541,00:13:55.091,00:00:02.550,,it's x equals ninety-four for sure 
177,11,2,00:13:56.751,00:13:58.001,00:00:01.250,,let's say that's right yeah 
178,11,2,00:14:02.771,00:14:03.461,00:00:00.690,,is that correct yeah the 
179,11,2,00:14:03.701,00:14:04.471,00:00:00.770,they don't show me answers ,
180,11,2,00:14:04.941,00:14:07.510,00:00:02.569,but yeah that's how you did the problems correctly ,
181,11,2,00:14:08.751,00:14:10.151,00:00:01.400,all right remember this is positive ,
182,11,2,00:14:09.936,00:14:10.686,00:00:00.750,,but that's negative 
183,11,2,00:14:11.176,00:14:18.050,00:00:06.874,,minus forty-eight I can write anything right there wait (inaudible) 
184,11,2,00:14:20.826,00:14:21.836,00:00:01.010,,let's get rid of that now okay pause filler 
185,11,2,00:14:27.700,00:14:28.580,00:00:00.880,,but I can get rid of that so plus 
186,11,2,00:14:29.621,00:14:33.281,00:00:03.660,,so we have to subtract forty-eight from ninety-seven well forty-seven time forty-eight 
187,11,2,00:14:38.820,00:14:42.060,00:00:03.240,,it's like forty-one I think or forty-nine 
188,11,2,00:14:41.781,00:14:42.811,00:00:01.030,just set it up ,
189,11,2,00:14:42.941,00:14:43.841,00:00:00.900,what's eight minus seven ,
190,11,2,00:14:44.176,00:14:46.506,00:00:02.330,,seven that's forty-eight pause filler 
191,11,2,00:14:48.236,00:14:50.506,00:00:02.270,,we have to make those seven fifteen across of that 
192,11,2,00:14:54.716,00:14:56.346,00:00:01.630,,so that would be a four 
193,11,2,00:14:56.316,00:14:57.156,00:00:00.840,you get nine ,
194,11,2,00:14:57.261,00:14:57.791,00:00:00.530,,and yeah it would be nine 
195,11,2,00:14:57.791,00:14:58.961,00:00:01.170,,so forty-nine that's good 
196,11,2,00:14:59.101,00:15:02.830,00:00:03.729,yup forty-nine equals negative twelve over five y ,
197,11,2,00:15:05.426,00:15:10.046,00:00:04.620,and you can wait twelve over five negative twelve over five isn't suppose one and cross multiply then ,
198,11,2,00:15:13.461,00:15:16.571,00:00:03.110,I mean yeah just the reciprocal of that ,
199,11,2,00:15:16.841,00:15:25.170,00:00:08.329,,yup so then five over twelve forty-nine times five over negative five twelve negative five over twelve pause filler let's see forty-nine times five 
200,11,2,00:15:26.276,00:15:29.926,00:00:03.650,,negative five over twelve
201,11,2,00:15:30.286,00:15:32.226,00:00:01.940,,well let's do this forty-nine five 
202,11,2,00:15:34.750,00:15:42.210,00:00:07.460,,five times nine is forty-five five thirty-four 
203,11,2,00:15:42.855,00:15:45.605,00:00:02.750,,and then that's twenty so twenty wait 
204,11,2,00:15:47.765,00:15:48.835,00:00:01.070,I can't (inaudible) ,
205,11,2,00:15:48.485,00:15:50.015,00:00:01.530,,yeah four (inaudible) twenty-four over five two over five 
206,11,2,00:15:51.595,00:15:52.745,00:00:01.150,wait how did you get that again ,
207,11,2,00:15:53.005,00:15:55.605,00:00:02.600,,because five times nine is forty-five 
208,11,2,00:15:55.830,00:15:58.840,00:00:03.010,,so carry the four and then four times 
209,11,2,00:15:58.980,00:16:02.500,00:00:03.520,,because it's twenty and then four because (inaudible) so yeah two four five yup 
210,11,2,00:16:07.605,00:16:10.935,00:00:03.330,okay number seven pause filler I need ,
211,11,2,00:16:10.095,00:16:16.020,00:00:05.925,,wait negative pause filler I need to fix that negative x equals 
212,11,2,00:16:16.725,00:16:18.475,00:00:01.750,,there we go I am good
213,11,2,00:16:20.345,00:16:21.965,00:00:01.620,okay (inaudible) hold on make that box bigger ,
214,11,2,00:16:23.630,00:16:24.980,00:00:01.350,,okay so negative 
215,11,2,00:16:25.825,00:16:27.915,00:00:02.090,so let's do a step by step remember these are negatives ,
216,11,2,00:16:30.075,00:16:32.005,00:00:01.930,,yup so that maybe we have to oh wait 
217,11,2,00:16:33.175,00:16:36.550,00:00:03.375,,so first we subtract y I think 
218,11,2,00:16:36.545,00:16:38.795,00:00:02.250,wait there is no equal sign what the heck ,
219,11,2,00:16:40.895,00:16:42.155,00:00:01.260,,well it's just equals sign 
220,11,2,00:16:42.850,00:16:46.230,00:00:03.380,oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I thought it was subtraction ,
221,11,2,00:16:46.355,00:16:47.005,00:00:00.650,got it yeah that's equal ,
222,11,2,00:16:47.435,00:16:49.585,00:00:02.150,,all right pause filler yeah it's kind of weird well so 
223,11,2,00:16:50.675,00:16:52.545,00:00:01.870,it's like what kind of math is this ,
224,11,2,00:16:53.745,00:16:55.155,00:00:01.410,,yeah what kind of witchcraft is this 
225,11,2,00:16:57.295,00:16:59.355,00:00:02.060,,pause filler so yeah I think it's subtract the y 
226,11,2,00:16:59.480,00:17:00.500,00:00:01.020,yeah subtract the y first ,
227,11,2,00:17:01.005,00:17:07.470,00:00:06.465,,so that means pause filler if you like negative wait thirteen negative thirteen over seven y 
228,11,2,00:17:09.995,00:17:10.865,00:00:00.870,,yup I think 
229,11,2,00:17:11.035,00:17:12.375,00:00:01.340,,I'm pretty sure that's right 
230,11,2,00:17:12.775,00:17:18.370,00:00:05.595,,thirteen over seven y equals okay well 
231,11,2,00:17:19.570,00:17:21.790,00:00:02.220,,so we're going to add sixty-one 
232,11,2,00:17:21.975,00:17:23.135,00:00:01.160,,it's (inaudible) for that 
233,11,2,00:17:23.250,00:17:24.230,00:00:00.980,,eighty-six 
234,11,2,00:17:25.535,00:17:26.545,00:00:01.010,eighty-six ,
235,11,2,00:17:27.135,00:17:29.555,00:00:02.420,yeah add that yup eighty-six ,
236,11,2,00:17:29.630,00:17:30.960,00:00:01.330,that's good that's good ,
237,11,2,00:17:30.990,00:17:31.420,00:00:00.430,you got everything it correctly ,
238,11,2,00:17:31.420,00:17:32.550,00:00:01.130,,so we're going to multiply it by pause filler eighty-six 
239,11,2,00:17:33.990,00:17:35.050,00:00:01.060,the reciprocal is going to be negative ,
240,11,2,00:17:35.265,00:17:39.665,00:00:04.400,,wait (inaudible) something it's two hundred forty-five divided by twelve oh shit 
241,11,2,00:17:45.940,00:17:47.270,00:00:01.330,I can't do it if I'm at this page ,
242,11,2,00:17:49.370,00:17:50.520,00:00:01.150,,it would be divide 
243,11,2,00:17:50.590,00:17:52.710,00:00:02.120,I think you got this problem right if you just multiply ,
244,11,2,00:17:53.245,00:17:54.475,00:00:01.230,,no I'm going to multiply it by twelve 
245,11,2,00:17:54.145,00:17:55.965,00:00:01.820,if you just multiply the reciprocal ,
246,11,2,00:17:57.130,00:17:58.260,00:00:01.130,,I didn't do it over twelve so we'll just add the over twelve there
247,11,2,00:18:02.300,00:18:04.010,00:00:01.710,pause filler but just add the reciprocal ,
248,11,2,00:18:04.320,00:18:05.690,00:00:01.370,so we'll do seven times ,
249,11,2,00:18:06.700,00:18:07.660,00:00:00.960,just do that first ,
250,11,2,00:18:08.545,00:18:09.305,00:00:00.760,and then just divide it by thirteen ,
251,11,2,00:18:09.490,00:18:10.670,00:00:01.180,,yup so pause filler let's see eighty-six 
252,11,2,00:18:15.644,00:18:19.780,00:00:04.136,and we can just leave that as in like ,
253,11,2,00:18:21.090,00:18:23.120,00:00:02.030,,yup so seven times six is forty-two apparently 
254,11,2,00:18:21.729,00:18:22.489,00:00:00.760,you divide it by thirteen ,
255,11,2,00:18:28.964,00:18:30.974,00:00:02.010,,wait no seven times eight is forty-two 
256,11,2,00:18:31.504,00:18:33.984,00:00:02.480,,wait no it's fifty-six fifty-six fifty-six fifty-six yeah 
257,11,2,00:18:37.640,00:18:39.200,00:00:01.560,fifty-six wait yeah ,
258,11,2,00:18:43.835,00:18:45.125,00:00:01.290,,all right and then well I would need zero 
259,11,2,00:18:45.435,00:18:46.585,00:00:01.150,,so that means that this would be off 
260,11,2,00:18:48.005,00:18:50.205,00:00:02.200,,but I don't okay fine pause filler what oh yeah 
261,11,2,00:18:51.665,00:18:54.315,00:00:02.650,,this would be a zero 
262,11,2,00:18:55.795,00:18:57.245,00:00:01.450,,and this would be a six six over two it's 
263,11,2,00:18:57.575,00:18:59.965,00:00:02.390,,I mean that y equals six o two over thirteen 
264,11,2,00:19:04.805,00:19:08.085,00:00:03.280,,how did you get the four okay all right twelve sixteen 
265,11,2,00:19:13.620,00:19:15.700,00:00:02.080,,I would definitely like just write this out 
266,11,2,00:19:16.260,00:19:18.090,00:00:01.830,,let me see seven times eighty-six right okay 
267,11,2,00:19:20.225,00:19:24.255,00:00:04.030,,yeah I have to keep going on seven okay pause filler seven 
268,11,2,00:19:31.405,00:19:32.475,00:00:01.070,,seven
269,11,2,00:19:33.245,00:19:34.215,00:00:00.970,that's right,
270,11,2,00:19:38.635,00:19:40.665,00:00:02.030,eight times seven seven times six ,
271,11,2,00:19:41.990,00:19:43.635,00:00:01.645,,sixty-eight was it 
272,11,2,00:19:45.790,00:19:49.580,00:00:03.790,six times six is thirty-six and another six ,
273,11,2,00:19:49.720,00:19:52.270,00:00:02.550,and you would get forty-two ,
274,11,2,00:19:53.550,00:19:54.300,00:00:00.750,,what's the number 
275,11,2,00:19:55.060,00:19:55.570,00:00:00.510,forty-two is six ,
276,11,2,00:19:56.600,00:20:00.210,00:00:03.610,,it's six here we go pause filler so eighty-six yeah 
277,11,2,00:20:01.390,00:20:05.270,00:00:03.880,yeah forty-two and then you get seven time twelve ,
278,11,2,00:20:05.080,00:20:06.190,00:00:01.110,,damn it so difficult to use 
279,11,2,00:20:06.600,00:20:07.560,00:00:00.960,,I would prefer a mouse but pause filler it's 
280,11,2,00:20:09.675,00:20:11.350,00:00:01.675,,wait (inaudible) 
281,11,2,00:20:12.765,00:20:14.400,00:00:01.635,,yeah six oh two 
282,11,2,00:20:15.255,00:20:17.730,00:00:02.475,six o two and then just do two two two ,
283,11,2,00:20:16.795,00:20:17.075,00:00:00.280,,positive 
284,11,2,00:20:20.220,00:20:26.460,00:00:06.240,y equals six over two equals thirteen ,
285,11,2,00:20:26.425,00:20:27.025,00:00:00.600,,oh yeah that's all I wrote 
286,11,2,00:20:27.240,00:20:28.410,00:00:01.170,,that's all I wrote up here yeah pause filler but okay 
287,11,2,00:20:33.950,00:20:37.320,00:00:03.370,next one all right this is negative all right ,
288,11,2,00:20:38.255,00:20:39.675,00:00:01.420,,yup a bunch of negatives here pause filler yup so pause filler 
289,11,2,00:20:44.030,00:20:45.120,00:00:01.090,you can get this out of the way or no ,
290,11,2,00:20:45.480,00:20:47.190,00:00:01.710,we could it the other way around what's that ,
291,11,2,00:20:47.580,00:20:48.790,00:00:01.210,you want to start on ,
292,11,2,00:20:49.730,00:20:50.460,00:00:00.730,what do you think is here ,
293,11,2,00:20:50.820,00:20:51.800,00:00:00.980,,I think we should move
294,11,2,00:20:54.385,00:20:56.525,00:00:02.140,,I think we should move the x over negative five 
295,11,2,00:20:57.110,00:20:58.600,00:00:01.490,,so I think we should pause filler should probably 
296,11,2,00:21:00.140,00:21:00.840,00:00:00.700,to the right side of left side ,
297,11,2,00:21:02.365,00:21:02.885,00:00:00.520,,to the right side 
298,11,2,00:21:02.970,00:21:03.970,00:00:01.000,okay so then we just add twelve I mean ,
299,11,2,00:21:05.475,00:21:06.755,00:00:01.280,,so yeah we can subtract seventeen 
300,11,2,00:21:07.760,00:21:08.790,00:00:01.030,subtract seventeen then yeah ,
301,11,2,00:21:10.090,00:21:13.170,00:00:03.080,,okay so subtracting seventeen we would get 
302,11,2,00:21:13.865,00:21:19.470,00:00:05.605,,pause filler negative ninety no negative hundred negative a hundred 
303,11,2,00:21:20.695,00:21:21.915,00:00:01.220,right yup negative one hundred ,
304,11,2,00:21:22.610,00:21:25.240,00:00:02.630,,negative one hundred equals
305,11,2,00:21:25.855,00:21:27.895,00:00:02.040,,let's see pause filler 
306,11,2,00:21:28.740,00:21:30.020,00:00:01.280,,it would be forty-three 
307,11,2,00:21:30.905,00:21:32.705,00:00:01.800,,because we're moving over to the eleven six 
308,11,2,00:21:34.230,00:21:36.560,00:00:02.330,,so if we subtract eleven we just multiply 
309,11,2,00:21:36.480,00:21:37.240,00:00:00.760,thirty-three ,
310,11,2,00:21:38.345,00:21:38.895,00:00:00.550,,yeah 
311,11,2,00:21:38.975,00:21:41.095,00:00:02.120,and then you would get pause filler twenty-one ,
312,11,2,00:21:41.190,00:21:43.260,00:00:02.070,,that's forty-three right no 
313,11,2,00:21:43.310,00:21:45.040,00:00:01.730,,because we're adding it 
314,11,2,00:21:45.240,00:21:46.890,00:00:01.650,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah you're adding yeah yeah so forty-three ,
315,11,2,00:21:47.990,00:21:50.090,00:00:02.100,,so forty-three forty-three over three x 
316,11,2,00:21:51.085,00:21:53.525,00:00:02.440,so negative one hundred equals forty-three over three x ,
317,11,2,00:21:54.710,00:21:57.360,00:00:02.650,,all right so negative one hundred
318,11,2,00:22:00.790,00:22:06.530,00:00:05.740,,pause filler so negative one hundred time three over forty-three 
319,11,2,00:22:08.045,00:22:19.150,00:00:11.105,,so negative a hundred time three is negative three hundred over forty-three equals x
320,11,2,00:22:20.965,00:22:22.525,00:00:01.560,I'll see if you do that right yup ,
321,11,2,00:22:23.510,00:22:26.160,00:00:02.650,and then just yup yup that's correct nine all right ,
322,11,2,00:22:30.240,00:22:33.460,00:00:03.220,pause filler let's do the same thing that we did last time ,
323,11,2,00:22:33.865,00:22:36.715,00:00:02.850,and just get this on the left side ,
324,11,2,00:22:36.910,00:22:38.860,00:00:01.950,,yeah it would be easier though so fourteen times four 
325,11,2,00:22:42.810,00:22:43.530,00:00:00.720,,let's see fourteen times four 
326,11,2,00:22:44.215,00:22:51.000,00:00:06.785,,so we're like we'll do it fourteen four so sixteen thirty-one fifty-six 
327,11,2,00:22:51.670,00:22:52.420,00:00:00.750,so fifty-six ,
328,11,2,00:22:53.150,00:22:56.330,00:00:03.180,,yup makes sense because it's seven times eight 
329,11,2,00:22:56.525,00:22:57.135,00:00:00.610,yeah ,
330,11,2,00:22:59.315,00:23:00.905,00:00:01.590,,yeah wait no I don't know yeah yeah yeah yeah right 
331,11,2,00:23:01.175,00:23:02.095,00:00:00.920,,yeah you're right 
332,11,2,00:23:02.540,00:23:08.620,00:00:06.080,,okay fifty-six so I mean it could be minus nineteen minus fifty-six over four pause filler 
333,11,2,00:23:10.675,00:23:13.545,00:00:02.870,no it's just fifty-six minus nineteen ,
334,11,2,00:23:14.845,00:23:17.275,00:00:02.430,,no ninety-six over pause filler nineteen minus fifty-six because we're subtract fourteen y 
335,11,2,00:23:21.435,00:23:22.525,00:00:01.090,I'll just write this out really quickly because here ,
336,11,2,00:23:26.710,00:23:32.420,00:00:05.710,once you get here left over is three and then three so thirty-three ,
337,11,2,00:23:33.800,00:23:36.660,00:00:02.860,,so negative thirty-three because we're subtracting yeah okay okay pause filler 
338,11,2,00:23:38.515,00:23:39.665,00:00:01.150,so negative thirty-three ,
339,11,2,00:23:40.865,00:23:43.555,00:00:02.690,,yeah plus fifty-five so we should get that to the other side 
340,11,2,00:23:44.605,00:23:46.415,00:00:01.810,and it's over y right I mean over four right ,
341,11,2,00:23:46.965,00:23:54.990,00:00:08.025,,yup all right and then we add fifty or sorry subtract fifty-five  
342,11,2,00:23:54.115,00:23:55.420,00:00:01.305,so nineteen or ,
343,11,2,00:23:55.860,00:23:58.610,00:00:02.750,,so then thirty-five minus thirty-four pause filler
344,11,2,00:24:00.700,00:24:03.690,00:00:02.990,,it's one twenty-one 
345,11,2,00:24:04.360,00:24:05.220,00:00:00.860,,so it would be negative twenty-one 
346,11,2,00:24:05.775,00:24:11.890,00:00:06.115,,so negative thirty-three over four y equals  
347,11,2,00:24:12.857,00:24:13.817,00:00:00.960,,twenty-one okay twenty-one
348,11,2,00:24:16.352,00:24:16.842,00:00:00.490,,ok
349,11,2,00:24:22.862,00:24:28.732,00:00:05.870,,and that means that we just have to subtract or multiply by twenty-one times 
350,11,2,00:24:31.142,00:24:33.942,00:00:02.800,,pause filler four over negative three
351,11,2,00:24:36.582,00:24:38.962,00:00:02.380,,because we can cancel out the negatives so yeah 
352,11,2,00:24:39.957,00:24:41.767,00:00:01.810,yeah you just cancel out the negative ,
353,11,2,00:24:42.147,00:24:44.360,00:00:02.213,so the negative is not on the variable ,
354,11,2,00:24:44.210,00:24:44.770,00:00:00.560,,yup  
355,11,2,00:24:45.237,00:24:46.137,00:00:00.900,,eighty-four yup that is in the middle 
356,11,2,00:24:49.280,00:24:51.210,00:00:01.930,,eighty-four over thirty 
357,11,2,00:24:52.542,00:24:53.392,00:00:00.850,yup negative so ,
358,11,2,00:24:53.902,00:24:59.260,00:00:05.358,,equals y no not negative because you have to cancel out the negative on the y and on the negative over there 
359,11,2,00:25:00.117,00:25:00.977,00:00:00.860,because they're both negatives ,
360,11,2,00:25:01.172,00:25:01.592,00:00:00.420,,yeah 
361,11,2,00:25:01.410,00:25:03.620,00:00:02.210,yeah so they're both negatives ,
362,11,2,00:25:03.740,00:25:07.340,00:00:03.600,yup you just multiply them by negative one and then ,
363,11,2,00:25:06.150,00:25:07.320,00:00:01.170,,I think we did that right 
364,11,2,00:25:07.577,00:25:08.557,00:00:00.980,yup good job next one ,
365,11,2,00:25:09.512,00:25:11.262,00:00:01.750,,forty-four 
366,11,2,00:25:11.472,00:25:12.772,00:00:01.300,oh it's a big one again ,
367,11,2,00:25:12.957,00:25:18.280,00:00:05.323,I think we should just start off again the seven pause filler to the other side ,
368,11,2,00:25:16.810,00:25:20.780,00:00:03.970,,wait maybe we can like simplify this 
369,11,2,00:25:21.030,00:25:25.150,00:00:04.120,,what can we divide all these things by that would make them simpler 
370,11,2,00:25:25.692,00:25:27.780,00:00:02.088,,can we divide this by eleven 
371,11,2,00:25:26.977,00:25:28.677,00:00:01.700,no we can divide it by seven right no ,
372,11,2,00:25:29.152,00:25:30.472,00:00:01.320,,what else you could do 
373,11,2,00:25:31.617,00:25:34.207,00:00:02.590,yeah but wait can we do two hundred two by eleven though ,
374,11,2,00:25:35.897,00:25:37.940,00:00:02.043,,pause filler I think so wait 
375,11,2,00:25:38.827,00:25:40.647,00:00:01.820,oh we can't get this divided by eleven ,
376,11,2,00:25:41.372,00:25:44.890,00:00:03.518,,it has to be pause filler zero would have to be two plus two 
377,11,2,00:25:45.240,00:25:48.770,00:00:03.530,,I think two forty-two is out of this 
378,11,2,00:25:47.510,00:25:50.720,00:00:03.210,anyway it seems like this answer is going to be like it does to multiple for ,
379,11,2,00:25:50.880,00:25:52.090,00:00:01.210,it's going to be a big fraction ,
380,11,2,00:25:52.140,00:25:54.260,00:00:02.120,so that's going to be messy I will ,
381,11,2,00:25:54.972,00:25:56.002,00:00:01.030,,actually manager stopped working oh shit pause filler 
382,11,2,00:26:00.892,00:26:01.552,00:00:00.660,,is this still working 
383,11,2,00:26:02.167,00:26:02.807,00:00:00.640,,is it still working

393,11,2,00:26:22.472,00:26:23.622,00:00:01.150,,we're good to go kind of weird pause filler okay so 
394,11,2,00:26:29.172,00:26:31.490,00:00:02.318,,okay let's move to seventy-seven over yup seventy-seven times fourteen oh god 
395,11,2,00:26:32.080,00:26:38.052,00:00:05.972,,yup seventy-seven times fourteen oh god 
396,11,2,00:26:41.810,00:26:43.990,00:00:02.180,, well seventy-seven times fourteen
397,11,2,00:26:44.837,00:26:47.287,00:00:02.450,seven pause filler I got a calculator ,
398,11,2,00:26:51.947,00:26:53.887,00:00:01.940,,well I can use (inaudible) 
399,11,2,00:26:54.492,00:26:58.930,00:00:04.438,,four times seven is pause filler twenty-eight eight negative two 
400,11,2,00:27:00.350,00:27:08.290,00:00:07.940,,four times seven is twenty-eight and zero three three hundred eight plus on zero seventy-seven 
401,11,2,00:27:09.347,00:27:11.367,00:00:02.020,,so it would be eight seven over one thousand seventy-eight 
402,11,2,00:27:13.102,00:27:14.762,00:00:01.660,well well done ,
403,11,2,00:27:16.177,00:27:17.287,00:00:01.110,,pause filler (inaudible) 
404,11,2,00:27:17.877,00:27:21.337,00:00:03.460,one thousand seven hundred over fourteen equals ,
405,11,2,00:27:20.570,00:27:24.460,00:00:03.890,,oh wait it would be no no no no no a hundred 
406,11,2,00:27:24.460,00:27:25.852,00:00:01.392,,we're subtracting from fifty 
407,11,2,00:27:27.352,00:27:27.822,00:00:00.470,wait ,
408,11,2,00:27:28.002,00:27:30.792,00:00:02.790,,or we can just subtract fifty on like that wait (inaudible) 
409,11,2,00:27:34.277,00:27:38.980,00:00:04.703,yeah that's what we subtract from fifty yup so ,
410,11,2,00:27:40.700,00:27:47.530,00:00:06.830,,yup all right so fifty or that would just be one zero two eight all right 
411,11,2,00:27:48.027,00:27:51.677,00:00:03.650,,and that would be negative so good 
412,11,2,00:27:52.007,00:28:00.790,00:00:08.783,,it's three forty-four equals two hundred two plus 
413,11,2,00:28:02.030,00:28:04.520,00:00:02.490,it's just one forty-two ,
414,11,2,00:28:06.670,00:28:08.030,00:00:01.360,,huh oh good good 
415,11,2,00:28:11.277,00:28:12.907,00:00:01.630,,anything we have happening in your side oh 
416,11,2,00:28:14.397,00:28:16.347,00:00:01.950,,because yeah something happened on my side 
417,11,2,00:28:16.927,00:28:19.417,00:00:02.490,,the computer said something about connection manager solving the work 
418,11,2,00:28:20.387,00:28:23.077,00:00:02.690,,I thought it would like mess something up 
419,11,2,00:28:23.217,00:28:25.167,00:00:01.950,,but we seem to be able to go on just fine 
420,11,2,00:28:32.187,00:28:32.707,00:00:00.520,,yup 
421,11,2,00:28:35.172,00:28:36.212,00:00:01.040,,sure 
422,11,2,00:29:09.757,00:29:10.767,00:00:01.010,(inaudible) bites ,
423,11,2,00:30:19.207,00:30:20.057,00:00:00.850,I've never seen you before broken eat less ,
424,11,2,00:30:20.347,00:30:21.077,00:00:00.730,,yup
425,11,2,00:31:24.180,00:31:26.020,00:00:01.840,so what do you like to do for your free time ,
426,11,2,00:31:27.192,00:31:27.942,00:00:00.750,,game 
427,11,2,00:31:29.252,00:31:29.912,00:00:00.660,nice ,
428,11,2,00:31:35.157,00:31:39.410,00:00:04.253,,yeah (inaudible) program and evolutionary big games simulations I have simulations 
429,11,2,00:31:41.777,00:31:44.510,00:00:02.733,what games do you play ,
430,11,2,00:31:44.837,00:31:45.817,00:00:00.980,or what game is that ,
431,11,2,00:31:46.332,00:31:56.790,00:00:10.458,,you can do it but never know pause filler on (inaudible) which I couldn't get to work for like a year now 
432,11,2,00:31:59.232,00:32:00.392,00:00:01.160,,I don't know how to use it 
433,11,2,00:32:00.857,00:32:07.660,00:00:06.803,,and pause filler things that are a little more in the gaming end are kind of like (inaudible) 
434,11,2,00:32:09.627,00:32:17.150,00:00:07.523,,it's a good natural select simulator definitely could be used in your class 
435,11,2,00:32:16.990,00:32:17.540,00:00:00.550,nice ,
436,11,2,00:32:27.092,00:32:28.552,00:00:01.460,,(inaudible) my teacher 
437,11,2,00:32:55.507,00:33:01.657,00:00:06.150,yeah it is very interesting how like natural selection work and stuff like that ,
438,11,2,00:33:01.987,00:33:02.877,00:00:00.890,,yeah
439,11,2,00:33:06.917,00:33:08.850,00:00:01.933,,hard to observe in this kind of reality 
440,11,2,00:33:19.612,00:33:25.560,00:00:05.948,,because pause filler things tend to live a long time annoying you for a long time 
441,11,2,00:33:26.462,00:33:30.372,00:00:03.910,well and the changes are pretty slow ,
442,11,2,00:33:30.650,00:33:38.460,00:00:07.810,,yeah well the reason they're still slow is because everything is really ridiculous in long time bacteria 
443,11,2,00:33:41.707,00:33:43.847,00:00:02.140,,it's easy to find the (inaudible) 
444,11,2,00:33:44.012,00:33:47.912,00:00:03.900,,and I have (inaudible) frequently to get resistant to antibiotics that we used (inaudible) yeah 
445,11,2,00:33:53.787,00:34:01.207,00:00:07.420,has there been any like recent like diseases that like we're immune to now ,
446,11,2,00:34:01.332,00:34:06.320,00:00:04.988,or is there anything like same things like that where like we are immune to now but we are like ,
447,11,2,00:34:10.842,00:34:13.952,00:00:03.110,,susceptible looks like it's going to start hey 
448,11,2,00:34:46.307,00:34:47.397,00:00:01.090,,oh I'll make sure not to do that 
449,11,2,00:35:03.437,00:35:04.717,00:00:01.280,pause filler let's see it's on black ,
450,11,2,00:35:09.462,00:35:10.092,00:00:00.630,all right ,
451,11,2,00:35:18.380,00:35:24.550,00:00:06.170,,yeah (inaudible) interesting pause filler I guess you could do this two ways 
452,11,2,00:35:24.550,00:35:27.022,00:00:02.472,,you could pause filler reciprocal everything 
453,11,2,00:35:27.857,00:35:30.657,00:00:02.800,,or you could multiply it by x and then divide it by twenty-five 
454,11,2,00:35:33.490,00:35:37.430,00:00:03.940,,I recommend just reciprocaling everything it's the same thing but you just yeah 
455,11,2,00:35:38.612,00:35:39.642,00:00:01.030,all right let's do that ,
456,11,2,00:35:40.690,00:35:46.260,00:00:05.570,,so basically you're seeing the process right 
457,11,2,00:35:46.707,00:35:47.447,00:00:00.740,yeah ,
458,11,2,00:35:47.710,00:35:52.210,00:00:04.500,,you multiply x which make this five x 
459,11,2,00:35:54.417,00:35:56.770,00:00:02.353,,and you just move this back to where the x was 
460,11,2,00:35:58.182,00:36:01.570,00:00:03.388,,because that makes it reciprocal basically 
461,11,2,00:36:02.297,00:36:03.937,00:00:01.640,so it would be point five x ,
462,11,2,00:36:04.652,00:36:05.282,00:00:00.630,,equals one and then you divide it by thirty-one 
463,11,2,00:36:07.172,00:36:08.732,00:00:01.560,,and then it would be going to 
464,11,2,00:36:13.387,00:36:16.557,00:00:03.170,and then you get x equals one over twenty-five ,
465,11,2,00:36:20.457,00:36:27.207,00:00:06.750,,yup all right negative thirty over y minus seventeen equals 
466,11,2,00:36:30.127,00:36:33.417,00:00:03.290,,it looks like that's where the equal signs 
467,11,2,00:36:33.507,00:36:34.837,00:00:01.330,yeah I'll (inaudible) so ,
468,11,2,00:36:35.487,00:36:36.207,00:00:00.720,,yeah (inaudible) 
469,11,2,00:36:36.872,00:36:37.492,00:00:00.620,,add something 
470,11,2,00:36:39.377,00:36:42.057,00:00:02.680,,good that would be pause filler 
471,11,2,00:36:42.682,00:36:43.382,00:00:00.700,eighty ,
472,11,2,00:36:51.260,00:36:54.650,00:00:03.390,,yup and now I guess you could reciprocal it 
473,11,2,00:36:59.977,00:37:00.967,00:00:00.990,mm-hmm  ,
474,11,2,00:37:19.510,00:37:23.350,00:00:03.840,so two hundred negative two hundred forty over y,
475,11,2,00:37:25.162,00:37:25.512,00:00:00.350,,yup 
476,11,2,00:37:31.482,00:37:32.222,00:00:00.740,and,
477,11,2,00:37:35.940,00:37:39.110,00:00:03.170,equals negative three ,
478,11,2,00:37:40.200,00:37:42.050,00:00:01.850,,wait actually I'm not sure about that 
479,11,2,00:37:42.850,00:37:43.690,00:00:00.840,wait equal like ,
480,11,2,00:37:44.777,00:37:46.147,00:00:01.370,,I'm not sure about that entire process 
481,11,2,00:37:47.387,00:37:48.737,00:00:01.350,,because if you can't multiply that you'd be dividing that 
482,11,2,00:37:47.977,00:37:56.330,00:00:08.353,yeah yeah it will be one x so ,
483,11,2,00:37:56.750,00:37:58.100,00:00:01.350,I mean y ,
484,11,2,00:37:58.437,00:38:00.547,00:00:02.110,and then we'll just ,
485,11,2,00:38:03.330,00:38:08.970,00:00:05.640,oh and then we would multiply it to both sides ,
486,11,2,00:38:11.107,00:38:11.637,00:00:00.530,,there's number two 
487,11,2,00:38:18.157,00:38:19.117,00:00:00.960,I think I did something wrong ,
488,11,2,00:38:21.132,00:38:21.672,00:00:00.540,,yeah 
489,11,2,00:38:23.747,00:38:25.257,00:00:01.510,oh I know I did wrong I pause filler ,
490,11,2,00:38:26.857,00:38:28.317,00:00:01.460,,you can just divide it by negative three 
491,11,2,00:38:28.932,00:38:32.622,00:00:03.690,no I did it yeah you divide it by negative three by eight ,
492,11,2,00:38:33.840,00:38:35.520,00:00:01.680,yeah I forgot to switch it though ,
493,11,2,00:38:35.892,00:38:36.492,00:00:00.600,,well maybe yeah 
494,11,2,00:38:38.417,00:38:41.267,00:00:02.850,yeah you see I'm supposed to do ,
495,11,2,00:38:40.727,00:38:44.717,00:00:03.990,,I guess it would just be y equals negative three divided by eighty 
496,11,2,00:38:45.507,00:38:46.037,00:00:00.530,yeah ,
497,11,2,00:38:48.660,00:38:50.670,00:00:02.010,,that was way more complicated than this 
498,11,2,00:38:51.340,00:38:51.610,00:00:00.270,yup  ,
499,11,2,00:38:58.740,00:39:00.850,00:00:02.110,and then we got pause filler twenty well ,
500,11,2,00:39:10.470,00:39:11.400,00:00:00.930,you don't get twenty fifteen ,
501,11,2,00:39:15.810,00:39:18.200,00:00:02.390,what's eighty divided by three twenty-four ,
502,11,2,00:39:18.995,00:39:21.795,00:00:02.800,,no I can actually probably look it up 
503,11,2,00:39:25.820,00:39:26.520,00:00:00.700,,pause filler eighty  
504,11,2,00:39:27.920,00:39:29.250,00:00:01.330,,oh god damn it 
505,11,2,00:39:40.305,00:39:40.965,00:00:00.660,,okay
506,11,2,00:39:46.350,00:39:46.830,00:00:00.480,,no
507,11,2,00:39:50.940,00:39:51.260,00:00:00.320,,equals
508,11,2,00:39:52.840,00:39:55.280,00:00:02.440,,negative twenty-six point six is six
509,11,2,00:39:56.050,00:39:57.970,00:00:01.920,,I don't think it can be simplified 
510,11,2,00:40:10.655,00:40:11.205,00:00:00.550,divided by seven ,
511,11,2,00:40:16.395,00:40:17.565,00:00:01.170,,yup nope I think I have to go there okay 
512,11,2,00:40:21.590,00:40:21.780,00:00:00.190,,okay
513,11,2,00:40:26.060,00:40:27.450,00:00:01.390,,I've scratched up fifty-four and pause filler 
514,11,2,00:40:30.055,00:40:31.145,00:00:01.090,,let's see how you do it pause filler 
515,11,2,00:40:34.350,00:40:36.530,00:00:02.180,,and five minus eleven is six right 
516,11,2,00:40:39.761,00:40:40.343,00:00:00.582,sixty-two ,
517,11,2,00:40:48.492,00:40:54.750,00:00:06.258,,yup I'm not recognizing my candy like a weird OCD person 
518,11,2,00:40:59.163,00:41:03.610,00:00:04.447,and then multiply it by both sides sixty-two k divided by four,
519,11,2,00:41:04.716,00:41:05.790,00:00:01.074,,yup that sounds good 
520,11,2,00:41:06.873,00:41:15.620,00:00:08.747,and then four divided to sixty-two would it be fifteen times ,
521,11,2,00:41:19.110,00:41:20.870,00:00:01.760,no thirty-two,
522,11,2,00:41:23.479,00:41:24.419,00:00:00.940,,what sixty-two 
523,11,2,00:41:27.330,00:41:28.570,00:00:01.240,six eighteen times ,
524,11,2,00:41:28.950,00:41:29.620,00:00:00.670,sixteen ,
525,11,2,00:41:30.430,00:41:31.190,00:00:00.760,sixteen times ,
526,11,2,00:41:32.604,00:41:34.384,00:00:01.780,,wait sixty-four or sixty-eight 
527,11,2,00:41:34.010,00:41:34.750,00:00:00.740,sixty-four ,
528,11,2,00:41:35.559,00:41:38.269,00:00:02.710,,and how about that number four 
529,11,2,00:41:38.099,00:41:39.069,00:00:00.970,by four ,
530,11,2,00:41:42.900,00:41:43.500,00:00:00.600,,sixteen 
531,11,2,00:41:45.114,00:41:47.114,00:00:02.000,with that k equals sixteen ,
532,11,2,00:41:49.239,00:41:49.819,00:00:00.580,,is that right 
533,11,2,00:41:51.454,00:41:51.934,00:00:00.480,,I think so 
534,11,2,00:41:53.609,00:41:55.099,00:00:01.490,yeah that's why you're supposed to get k ,
535,11,2,00:41:55.149,00:41:57.749,00:00:02.600,,wait isn't that sixty-two over there 
536,11,2,00:41:57.774,00:41:58.604,00:00:00.830,yeah it is so ,
537,11,2,00:41:59.124,00:42:01.274,00:00:02.150,,it placed sixty-four oh well 
538,11,2,00:42:01.624,00:42:03.094,00:00:01.470,,no then I don't think it does 
539,11,2,00:42:05.780,00:42:08.140,00:00:02.360,well compute on sixty-four ,
540,11,2,00:42:09.640,00:42:13.610,00:00:03.970,so it will be like fifteen point yeah ,
541,11,2,00:42:17.564,00:42:19.204,00:00:01.640,,I would leave you with one over k equals sixty-two over four 
542,11,2,00:42:23.769,00:42:26.889,00:00:03.120,are we even doing this right I feel like we're doing something wrong  ,
543,11,2,00:42:27.414,00:42:27.814,00:00:00.400,,yeah 
544,11,2,00:42:28.819,00:42:31.999,00:00:03.180,because like we get sixty-two ,
545,11,2,00:42:34.410,00:42:37.110,00:00:02.700,,it gets difficult when you don't have like a calculator now 
546,11,2,00:42:37.619,00:42:40.350,00:00:02.731,,because then you spend so much time looking up on the map 
547,11,2,00:42:41.494,00:42:43.084,00:00:01.590,,and it's hard to do in the algebra 
548,11,2,00:42:47.414,00:42:48.214,00:00:00.800,okay ,
549,11,2,00:42:49.270,00:42:53.600,00:00:04.330,,sixty divided by four could be simplified to thirty-one divided by two 
550,11,2,00:42:53.600,00:42:55.140,00:00:01.540,,and that's simplified again 
551,11,2,00:42:55.229,00:42:57.889,00:00:02.660,,so one over k equals thirty-one over two 
552,11,2,00:42:58.804,00:43:01.734,00:00:02.930,,which means that k equals thirty-two one over thirty-two but no yes 
553,11,2,00:43:04.100,00:43:05.260,00:00:01.160,oh yeah yeah yeah because we can just ,
554,11,2,00:43:05.630,00:43:08.080,00:00:02.450,,no two over thirty-one two over thirty-one there we go 
555,11,2,00:43:09.219,00:43:15.550,00:00:06.331,so k equals two over thirty-one because that's the possible (inaudible) in that scenario  ,
556,11,2,00:43:15.024,00:43:15.624,00:00:00.600,,yeah 
557,11,2,00:43:16.419,00:43:19.270,00:00:02.851,yup yeah I forgot about that we could just where we're used fraction ,
558,11,2,00:43:20.769,00:43:21.609,00:00:00.840,all right let's move on so this ,
559,11,2,00:43:24.004,00:43:25.414,00:00:01.410,,(inaudible) 
560,11,2,00:43:27.034,00:43:27.734,00:00:00.700,mm-hmm ,
561,11,2,00:43:28.379,00:43:30.379,00:00:02.000,,we could just divide by negative fourteen 
562,11,2,00:43:32.064,00:43:33.474,00:00:01.410,no no it's what I'm supposed to do ,
563,11,2,00:43:36.800,00:43:38.460,00:00:01.660,,what does it say to do 
564,11,2,00:43:38.709,00:43:39.309,00:00:00.600,,which one is this 
565,11,2,00:43:40.124,00:43:40.524,00:00:00.400,yeah ,
566,11,2,00:43:41.289,00:43:43.699,00:00:02.410,,definitely multiply both sides by x 
567,11,2,00:43:44.639,00:43:46.979,00:00:02.340,,but you can also just like divide it by fourteen and then that's what you get 
568,11,2,00:43:48.034,00:43:50.734,00:00:02.700,,yeah and then you get one (inaudible) reciprocal 
569,11,2,00:43:56.309,00:43:58.189,00:00:01.880,all right so pause filler  ,
570,11,2,00:44:02.574,00:44:05.094,00:00:02.520,multiply by both sides ,
571,11,2,00:44:05.359,00:44:12.080,00:00:06.721,pause filler no calculator two hundred and ten divided by fourteen,
572,11,2,00:44:12.220,00:44:16.290,00:00:04.070,,pause filler they can both be reduced by seven 
573,11,2,00:44:18.224,00:44:22.960,00:00:04.736,,so that would be the same thing as pause filler thirty over two fifteen 
574,11,2,00:44:24.984,00:44:29.590,00:00:04.606,yeah if we reduce it by seven because seven keep going ,
575,11,2,00:44:31.119,00:44:35.149,00:00:04.030,,fourteen twice and two hundred ten thirty times  
576,11,2,00:44:36.950,00:44:39.770,00:00:02.820,,I believe it's thirty over two pause filler fifteen
577,11,2,00:44:43.719,00:44:44.839,00:00:01.120,so yeah so fifteen  ,
578,11,2,00:44:46.614,00:44:47.724,00:00:01.110,so y equals fifteen,
579,11,2,00:44:51.520,00:44:53.490,00:00:01.970,,yup no one over y equals fifteen 
580,11,2,00:44:54.474,00:44:54.984,00:00:00.510,one ,
581,11,2,00:44:55.544,00:44:56.424,00:00:00.880,,so y equals fourteen over fifteen I'm pretty sure  
582,11,2,00:44:58.159,00:44:59.199,00:00:01.040,so y equals negative fifteen ,
583,11,2,00:45:01.040,00:45:05.230,00:00:04.190,,yeah no y over no pause filler y equals negative one over fifteen 
584,11,2,00:45:07.034,00:45:09.364,00:00:02.330,,because with the reciprocal of the y you have the reciprocal of fifteen too 
585,11,2,00:45:10.204,00:45:10.974,00:00:00.770,yeah yeah yeah ,
586,11,2,00:45:15.914,00:45:16.674,00:00:00.760,,and that's I guess what you end up with 
587,11,2,00:45:17.839,00:45:20.299,00:00:02.460,you have to reciprocal everything all right over five let's see ,
588,11,2,00:45:25.114,00:45:27.704,00:00:02.590,,hundred thirteen equals five over x 
589,11,2,00:45:27.864,00:45:30.644,00:00:02.780,,so I definitely get that to the other side so thirty-two seven 
590,11,2,00:45:34.609,00:45:35.219,00:00:00.610,you add it ,
591,11,2,00:45:35.799,00:45:48.230,00:00:12.431,so one thirty-seven equals over x ,
592,11,2,00:45:49.064,00:45:52.154,00:00:03.090,and then multiply the reciprocal ,
593,11,2,00:45:50.844,00:45:52.654,00:00:01.810,,you divide it by five 
594,11,2,00:45:52.914,00:45:56.404,00:00:03.490,or yeah it's technically what you're doing anyway ,
595,11,2,00:45:57.174,00:46:01.360,00:00:04.186,well then I think that's all you got for one twenty yes ,
596,11,2,00:46:02.044,00:46:03.044,00:00:01.000,,divide by five and then 
597,11,2,00:46:04.559,00:46:05.709,00:00:01.150,I don't think you can simplify ,
598,11,2,00:46:06.019,00:46:10.099,00:00:04.080,,so x equals pause filler five over a hundred (inaudible) 
599,11,2,00:46:10.624,00:46:11.264,00:00:00.640,yeah ,
600,11,2,00:46:13.389,00:46:15.509,00:00:02.120,,no no it's the other way around 
601,11,2,00:46:17.210,00:46:19.410,00:00:02.200,,because right now right now this is true one 
602,11,2,00:46:23.159,00:46:24.769,00:00:01.610,,or yeah this is true right now 
603,11,2,00:46:25.079,00:46:26.959,00:00:01.880,,you have to make it so the x is on top so it's a whole number 
604,11,2,00:46:29.784,00:46:34.530,00:00:04.746,,you have to make it so that x equals five over (inaudible) 
605,11,2,00:46:36.329,00:46:38.049,00:00:01.720,oh huh ,
606,11,2,00:46:38.184,00:46:40.864,00:00:02.680,,x equals five over a hundred and five 
607,11,2,00:46:41.029,00:46:44.329,00:00:03.300,oh yeah yeah a whole number ,
608,11,2,00:46:46.140,00:46:49.300,00:00:03.160,,yeah because of the Ys its x is over one 
609,11,2,00:46:51.769,00:46:52.569,00:00:00.800,,hey what do you have here 
610,11,2,00:46:53.544,00:46:54.784,00:00:01.240,pause filler what would be easier ,
611,11,2,00:46:55.919,00:46:58.259,00:00:02.340,,I think it would be easier they're both over x  
612,11,2,00:46:59.444,00:47:02.174,00:00:02.730,,so it would be easier to move pause filler the smaller one to the other side 
613,11,2,00:47:03.764,00:47:06.134,00:00:02.370,,so I think we should move three x to the right three over x to the right 
614,11,2,00:47:08.094,00:47:09.634,00:00:01.540,and that would be yeah yeah ,
615,11,2,00:47:09.709,00:47:11.019,00:00:01.310,,and that would be fifteen over x 
616,11,2,00:47:13.600,00:47:19.170,00:00:05.570,,and if we move eleven to the other side by negative in it (inaudible) now pause filler 
617,11,2,00:47:21.494,00:47:22.094,00:00:00.600,it would be positive ,
618,11,2,00:47:23.929,00:47:24.849,00:00:00.920,,no we got 
619,11,2,00:47:24.894,00:47:26.934,00:00:02.040,oh yeah so go to the left so I mean it's only negative but  ,
620,11,2,00:47:29.579,00:47:30.839,00:00:01.260,,yup between negative a hundred and twelve 
621,11,2,00:47:34.204,00:47:34.824,00:00:00.620,yeah thirteen ,
622,11,2,00:47:36.339,00:47:38.329,00:00:01.990,,wait now I think it would just be a hundred and three 
623,11,2,00:47:41.029,00:47:42.489,00:00:01.460,yeah a hundred and three and  ,
624,11,2,00:47:45.274,00:47:46.644,00:00:01.370,pause filler just multiply the reciprocal,
625,11,2,00:47:49.354,00:47:51.014,00:00:01.660,so you're just dividing by fifteen ,
626,11,2,00:47:52.369,00:47:53.589,00:00:01.220,,yup and then you're moving the x over 
627,11,2,00:47:54.034,00:47:55.364,00:00:01.330,I think you're done right ,
628,11,2,00:47:57.814,00:48:00.064,00:00:02.250,,well yeah but you also have to do pause filler put 
629,11,2,00:48:00.634,00:48:02.754,00:00:02.120,,so the x is on top 
630,11,2,00:48:03.919,00:48:06.269,00:00:02.350,,which means x equals fifteen 
631,11,2,00:48:06.239,00:48:08.289,00:00:02.050,over negative one o three ,
632,11,2,00:48:08.059,00:48:09.799,00:00:01.740,,yeah negative one o three oh 
633,11,2,00:48:14.324,00:48:15.634,00:00:01.310,,okay I think I'm giving you the answers 
634,11,2,00:48:17.444,00:48:18.424,00:00:00.980,well I could write down the answers ,
635,11,2,00:48:20.379,00:48:24.290,00:00:03.911,,yeah I'll just get rid of all that (sfx) 
636,11,2,00:48:27.379,00:48:28.039,00:00:00.660,,there we go 
637,11,2,00:48:29.364,00:48:29.804,00:00:00.440,thanks ,
638,11,2,00:48:30.359,00:48:31.219,00:00:00.860,,they're all got rid of 
639,11,2,00:48:32.380,00:48:34.080,00:00:01.700,fifteen I mean I understand negative one three ,
640,11,2,00:48:39.049,00:48:40.819,00:00:01.770,pause filler let's see ,
641,11,2,00:48:42.800,00:48:43.770,00:00:00.970,,it could be easier again to 
642,11,2,00:48:45.569,00:48:46.179,00:00:00.610,,oh crap we're wrong 
643,11,2,00:48:47.789,00:48:48.299,00:00:00.510,for the last one ,
644,11,2,00:48:49.260,00:48:51.890,00:00:02.630,,no yeah for the last one because we'd be subtracting it 
645,11,2,00:48:53.309,00:48:58.850,00:00:05.541,,it would mean pause filler nine over pause filler x equals nine over a hundred and three 
646,11,2,00:48:59.509,00:49:00.670,00:00:01.161,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right ,
647,11,2,00:49:02.119,00:49:03.309,00:00:01.190,,oh we almost made that mistake 
648,11,2,00:49:04.020,00:49:05.010,00:00:00.990,oh shoot yeah because we added it yeah ,
649,11,2,00:49:05.989,00:49:08.199,00:00:02.210,because yeah there's a positive there ,
650,11,2,00:49:08.349,00:49:10.359,00:00:02.010,so you should be subtracting it oh crap ,
651,11,2,00:49:10.819,00:49:12.619,00:00:01.800,so nine it would just ,
652,11,2,00:49:12.194,00:49:14.284,00:00:02.090,,I don't think that changes any of our 
653,11,2,00:49:13.924,00:49:19.140,00:00:05.216,yeah we'll just change fifteen to a nine that's all we do  ,
654,11,2,00:49:19.200,00:49:21.280,00:00:02.080,,yup nine there we go 
655,11,2,00:49:21.330,00:49:21.890,00:00:00.560,I got it ,
656,11,2,00:49:22.474,00:49:23.224,00:00:00.750,,yeah 
657,11,2,00:49:30.694,00:49:36.280,00:00:05.586,nine over negative one over three yeah those negatives man,
658,11,2,00:49:37.734,00:49:38.374,00:00:00.640,,all right so yes pause filler we got to subtract 
659,11,2,00:49:38.509,00:49:43.360,00:00:04.851,oh yeah so we're going to move this ,
660,11,2,00:49:43.209,00:49:45.250,00:00:02.041,,make sure we don't have to make the same mistakes 
661,11,2,00:49:45.694,00:49:47.254,00:00:01.560,,so make sure it's eight over x 
662,11,2,00:49:47.929,00:49:51.640,00:00:03.711,eight over x equals ,
663,11,2,00:49:53.010,00:49:55.980,00:00:02.970,,oh and this one is nice because again because we'll have positive numbers on both sides 
664,11,2,00:49:58.474,00:49:59.504,00:00:01.030,this is true this is very true  ,
665,11,2,00:50:00.454,00:50:04.104,00:00:03.650,,so we can subtract the twenty-five add sixty minus twenty-five is   
666,11,2,00:50:08.860,00:50:10.500,00:00:01.640,, pause filler forty-five
667,11,2,00:50:12.544,00:50:13.604,00:00:01.060,I think one twenty-five ,
668,11,2,00:50:14.669,00:50:15.509,00:00:00.840,,I think it's forty-five 
669,11,2,00:50:16.994,00:50:17.574,00:00:00.580,,I mean thirty-five 
670,11,2,00:50:18.039,00:50:21.989,00:00:03.950,yeah thirty-five and then just over eight ,
671,11,2,00:50:24.979,00:50:25.259,00:00:00.280,,yup 
672,11,2,00:50:25.644,00:50:29.804,00:00:04.160,divided by eight what kind of equals that it's pen that's crazy ,
673,11,2,00:50:31.269,00:50:32.859,00:00:01.590,does it equal to yup does equal five yeah ,
674,11,2,00:50:35.379,00:50:36.909,00:00:01.530,,yeah no no no that would be great 
675,11,2,00:50:41.579,00:50:43.499,00:00:01.920,,that would be forty yeah thirty-five going to eight or eight going thirty-five 
676,11,2,00:50:44.040,00:50:49.630,00:00:05.590,so we just leave it as that so x equals eight over thirty-five  ,
677,11,2,00:50:49.554,00:50:51.480,00:00:01.926,,yup there you go you got it 
678,11,2,00:50:55.449,00:50:58.829,00:00:03.380,,pause filler I left my free mystery just for last 
679,11,2,00:50:59.120,00:51:03.320,00:00:04.200,to look back pause filler well let's subtract this on this side so over there ,
680,11,2,00:51:05.050,00:51:10.460,00:00:05.410,so we just get one over x equals ,
681,11,2,00:51:11.244,00:51:15.074,00:00:03.830,and unfortunately this is going to be negative so it's going to be  ,
682,11,2,00:51:15.214,00:51:19.430,00:00:04.216,,pause filler negative one o three again negative one o three one common number negative one o three divided b one and then we get just x equals negative oh no just one  
683,11,2,00:51:22.804,00:51:26.684,00:00:03.880,negative one o three divided by one ,
684,11,2,00:51:28.809,00:51:33.380,00:00:04.571,and then we get just x equals negative oh no just one ,
685,11,2,00:51:34.139,00:51:36.319,00:00:02.180,,well you can say negative one over one o three 
686,11,2,00:51:36.614,00:51:39.004,00:00:02.390,yeah I think it just looks better ,
687,11,2,00:51:41.224,00:51:42.894,00:00:01.670,and that's our (inaudible) equal sign ,
688,11,2,00:51:43.064,00:51:44.224,00:00:01.160,,equals yeah 
689,11,2,00:51:44.779,00:51:51.180,00:00:06.401,last problem pause filler I'm assuming this isn't equal right here again ,
690,11,2,00:51:51.959,00:51:53.759,00:00:01.800,,remember that one is negative five so you can add this one  
691,11,2,00:51:55.674,00:51:56.474,00:00:00.800,yeah it is negative ,
692,11,2,00:51:56.689,00:52:00.219,00:00:03.530,so just be eleven x over x ,
693,11,2,00:52:01.509,00:52:02.909,00:00:01.400,and then we can add ,
694,11,2,00:52:03.214,00:52:06.094,00:00:02.880,,yeah you can add the one o nine too so 
695,11,2,00:52:06.979,00:52:11.220,00:00:04.241,yeah well no no no we can't because this is going on this side  ,
696,11,2,00:52:11.830,00:52:13.440,00:00:01.610,so this has to be going on that side ,
697,11,2,00:52:14.309,00:52:15.369,00:00:01.060,,okay you're right 
698,11,2,00:52:15.714,00:52:16.924,00:00:01.210,,and then we'll subtract it 
699,11,2,00:52:17.124,00:52:19.074,00:00:01.950,so then subtract it so then pause filler ,
700,11,2,00:52:19.274,00:52:21.464,00:00:02.190,,negative three 
701,11,2,00:52:22.224,00:52:26.520,00:00:04.296,three so it would be three-hundred negative three hundred forty ,
702,11,2,00:52:30.870,00:52:41.780,00:00:10.910,three hundred forty divided by eleven so x equals eleven over,
703,11,2,00:52:42.774,00:52:46.624,00:00:03.850,we could see negative to the matter three hundred and forty ,
704,11,2,00:52:48.624,00:52:49.464,00:00:00.840,,yup I think we got this and pause filler 
705,11,2,00:52:53.430,00:52:54.170,00:00:00.740,,stop look at this okay 
706,11,2,00:52:56.749,00:52:57.449,00:00:00.700,all right ,
707,11,2,00:53:35.104,00:53:35.884,00:00:00.780,,good 
708,11,2,00:53:38.624,00:53:39.694,00:00:01.070,all right I'm on it ,
709,11,2,00:53:39.564,00:53:40.914,00:00:01.350,,well he's already on that page 
710,11,2,00:53:41.464,00:53:42.884,00:00:01.420,,it's continuous for some reason 
711,11,2,00:53:44.059,00:53:46.039,00:00:01.980,,okay so we're on page thirteen right 
712,11,2,00:53:47.354,00:53:48.014,00:00:00.660,yeah ,
713,11,2,00:53:50.289,00:53:51.829,00:00:01.540,,because yeah it goes on to 
714,11,2,00:53:52.894,00:53:55.280,00:00:02.386,,so there's like a bonus round 
715,11,2,00:53:56.764,00:53:59.980,00:00:03.216,all right so you see ,
716,11,2,00:54:00.670,00:54:05.260,00:00:04.590,,yup tell me what you haven't seen before actually yeah kind of 
717,11,2,00:54:05.689,00:54:08.600,00:00:02.911,,because we have constants or we have coefficients 
718,11,2,00:54:07.930,00:54:13.340,00:00:05.410,so the first thing we should probably do is to get twenty onto the other side so we get seven  ,
719,11,2,00:54:13.684,00:54:14.824,00:00:01.140,,so we subtract twenty yeah seven 
720,11,2,00:54:16.079,00:54:17.019,00:00:00.940,and then we can just add this ,
721,11,2,00:54:18.224,00:54:21.244,00:00:03.020,,yeah so then it would be twelve over three x 
722,11,2,00:54:21.640,00:54:24.990,00:00:03.350,,that has to be reduced to four over x 
723,11,2,00:54:25.474,00:54:31.910,00:00:06.436,three x so over two yeah and let me just yeah reduce it by three so then four ,
724,11,2,00:54:28.644,00:54:29.234,00:00:00.590,,yeah 
725,11,2,00:54:33.484,00:54:34.024,00:00:00.540,,so four over x 
726,11,2,00:54:35.679,00:54:37.529,00:00:01.850,and then we multiply that again ,
727,11,2,00:54:38.859,00:54:39.889,00:00:01.030,I'll just do this just like explain it four x  ,
728,11,2,00:54:43.620,00:54:47.750,00:00:04.130,and then multiply that by seven right no no ,
729,11,2,00:54:47.619,00:54:48.249,00:00:00.630,,so we'll divide yeah 
730,11,2,00:54:48.829,00:54:49.329,00:00:00.500,divide ,
731,11,2,00:54:49.589,00:54:50.379,00:00:00.790,,seven over four 
732,11,2,00:54:50.910,00:54:53.000,00:00:02.090,so seven over x equals seven over four ,
733,11,2,00:54:53.649,00:54:54.559,00:00:00.910,,x equals four over seven 
734,11,2,00:54:54.609,00:54:55.559,00:00:00.950,four yeah yeah yeah yeah ,
735,11,2,00:54:57.349,00:54:58.389,00:00:01.040,,yeah well that's good 
736,11,2,00:55:00.884,00:55:01.344,00:00:00.460,oh boy ,
737,11,2,00:55:01.799,00:55:04.819,00:00:03.020,,pause filler what's that okay okay pause filler 
738,11,2,00:55:05.664,00:55:06.344,00:00:00.680,I'm freaking out ,
739,11,2,00:55:07.629,00:55:08.919,00:00:01.290,,we can pause filler 
740,11,2,00:55:11.700,00:55:12.590,00:00:00.890,just divide by ,
741,11,2,00:55:14.399,00:55:16.109,00:00:01.710,,yeah I mean pause filler 
742,11,2,00:55:17.739,00:55:19.849,00:00:02.110,don't you just divide it by two ,
743,11,2,00:55:19.449,00:55:21.069,00:00:01.620,,we used to (inaudible) 
744,11,2,00:55:21.264,00:55:22.084,00:00:00.820,,now we'll make it easier 
745,11,2,00:55:24.010,00:55:27.810,00:00:03.800,your reciprocal so it would be like ,
746,11,2,00:55:28.254,00:55:32.230,00:00:03.976,,yeah yeah yeah yeah in fact I know how to get this I know how to get this (inaudible) okay  
747,11,2,00:55:32.709,00:55:33.819,00:00:01.110,,okay that makes it a lot easy 
748,11,2,00:55:33.160,00:55:35.030,00:00:01.870,don't use it as a cumulative property ,
749,11,2,00:55:34.500,00:55:38.760,00:00:04.260,,no no yeah well you can do that but pause filler (inaudible) 
750,11,2,00:55:44.274,00:55:44.794,00:00:00.520,all right ,
751,11,2,00:55:51.694,00:55:52.444,00:00:00.750,oh yeah ,
752,11,2,00:55:57.149,00:55:58.409,00:00:01.260,(inaudible) well I can ,
753,11,2,00:56:11.354,00:56:12.844,00:00:01.490,we have to prove that like ,
754,11,2,00:56:20.269,00:56:21.279,00:00:01.010,,wow fifty-seven minutes 
755,11,2,00:56:29.879,00:56:30.579,00:00:00.700,,bye 
756,11,2,00:56:32.594,00:56:33.214,00:00:00.620,bye ,
