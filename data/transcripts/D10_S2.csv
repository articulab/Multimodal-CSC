00:11:27.560,00:11:34.824,00:00:07.264,,,,,"okay I'm going to try this so forty times seven"
00:11:34.824,00:11:37.289,00:00:02.465,,,,,"how come I don't have that memorized"
00:11:37.289,00:11:37.432,00:00:00.143,,,"I don't know",,"how come I don't have that memorized"

00:11:38.315,00:11:40.289,00:00:01.974,,,,,"let's do it in my head"
00:11:51.520,00:11:53.506,00:00:01.986,,,,,"would that be two hundred and eighty"
00:11:54.288,00:11:55.247,00:00:00.959,,,,,"that's what I got"
00:11:58.164,00:12:01.391,00:00:03.227,,,"yeah two eighty",,
00:12:02.237,00:12:06.262,00:00:04.025,,,,,"two eighty that way right that's the top or the bottom"
00:12:06.282,00:12:07.190,00:00:00.908,,,,,"I think that's the top"
00:12:07.557,00:12:09.435,00:00:01.878,,,"top because forty times seven",,
00:12:09.435,00:12:12.378,00:00:02.943,,,,,"yeah over a three x then"
00:12:12.837,00:12:13.046,00:00:00.209,,,"yeah",,
00:12:18.646,00:12:29.734,00:00:11.088,,,,,"and then I'm confused"
00:12:29.741,00:12:41.761,00:00:12.020,,,,,"because it's supposed to say like in the format of this equals like constant constant constant equals variable or something like that"
00:12:42.629,00:12:44.612,00:00:01.983,,,,,"so now it's just fraction"
00:12:46.966,00:12:48.845,00:00:01.879,,,,,"oh well I'll see"
00:12:48.891,00:12:51.759,00:00:02.868,,,,,"maybe I'll get the right answer and just be doing it the wrong way"
00:12:52.238,00:12:52.891,00:00:00.653,,,"(laughter)",,
00:12:58.981,00:13:03.013,00:00:04.032,,,,,"so try to get rid of yeah see"
00:13:03.013,00:13:05.635,00:00:02.622,,,"I'm looking at it",,"so try to get rid of yeah see"
00:13:05.635,00:13:05.644,00:00:00.009,,,"I'm looking at it",,
00:13:05.644,00:13:07.074,00:00:01.430,,,"I'm looking at it",,"now this is all messed up"
00:13:07.074,00:13:07.433,00:00:00.359,,,"I'm looking at it",,
00:13:08.627,00:13:10.355,00:00:01.728,,,"(pause filler) I'm looking at-",,

00:13:11.075,00:13:12.382,00:00:01.307,,,"I never learned about this one",,
00:13:12.581,00:13:17.670,00:00:05.089,,,,,"yeah okay maybe I should try it a different way"
00:13:17.670,00:13:20.344,00:00:02.674,,,,,"and then if it doesn't work I'll come back to it"
00:13:20.413,00:13:25.299,00:00:04.886,,,"it sounds like a hundred equals the fraction with a number (inaudible)",,
00:13:25.542,00:13:27.896,00:00:02.354,,,"so it says to go like first",,
00:13:27.896,00:13:30.211,00:00:02.315,,,"it would be forty times thirty-seven",,
00:13:30.211,00:13:32.007,00:00:01.796,,,"and then that's the answer",,
00:13:33.234,00:13:35.037,00:00:01.803,,,,,"forty times what"
00:13:35.037,00:13:36.691,00:00:01.654,,,"thirty-seven so",,"forty times what"

00:13:37.196,00:13:42.261,00:00:05.065,,,,,"okay how would you do that"
00:13:42.673,00:13:46.037,00:00:03.364,,,"I think we might have to set up a forty as a fraction",,
00:13:46.614,00:13:49.299,00:00:02.685,,,"so maybe we could put it over one forty over one times",,
00:13:49.299,00:13:51.224,00:00:01.925,,,"so maybe we could put it over one forty over one times",,"yeah that makes sense"
00:13:51.224,00:13:51.323,00:00:00.099,,,"so maybe we could put it over one forty over one times",,
00:13:52.084,00:13:52.542,00:00:00.458,,,"yeah",,
00:13:52.542,00:13:52.588,00:00:00.046,,,"yeah",,"three that's a bad three"

00:20:15.110,00:20:16.338,00:00:01.228,,,,,"okay so what does it say to do"
00:20:17.033,00:20:22.684,00:00:05.651,,,"it says this one is a hundred equals two over three y",,
00:20:23.091,00:20:23.124,00:00:00.033,,,"so it says multiply both sides by three over two",,
00:20:23.124,00:20:23.490,00:00:00.366,,,"so it says multiply both sides by three over two",,"okay"

00:20:29.177,00:20:29.644,00:00:00.467,,,,,"okay"
00:20:29.701,00:20:30.899,00:00:01.198,,,"and then it gets a hundred and fifty",,
00:20:31.572,00:20:34.990,00:00:03.418,,,,,"so multiply oh yeah that makes sense now okay"
00:20:35.480,00:20:35.492,00:00:00.012,,,,,"because you're trying to get k"
00:20:35.492,00:20:35.961,00:00:00.469,,,"yeah",,"because you're trying to get k"

00:20:36.908,00:20:39.451,00:00:02.543,,,,,"so we'll multiply why side by three over eight"
00:20:39.971,00:20:43.454,00:00:03.483,,,"because three over eight times three over eight we'll cross cancel that out so fourteen time three over eight",,
00:20:43.454,00:20:43.927,00:00:00.473,,,"because three over eight times three over eight we'll cross cancel that out so fourteen time three over eight",,"yeah"

00:20:46.250,00:20:55.317,00:00:09.067,,,,,"so here I just got k and then oh three over eight and the answer"
00:20:55.317,00:21:00.913,00:00:05.596,,,,,"this has been a b equal to k times fourteen over one equals"

00:21:07.466,00:21:09.906,00:00:02.440,,,"maybe I guess a lowest common denominator thing",,
00:21:11.057,00:21:15.567,00:00:04.510,,,,,"maybe or you just got to like divide or something"
00:21:16.124,00:21:18.198,00:00:02.074,,,"because one could go into eight pretty easily",,
00:21:18.198,00:21:20.722,00:00:02.524,,,"so eight would be the lowest common denominator",,
00:21:20.722,00:21:21.317,00:00:00.595,,,"so it would be three over eight times fourteen over eight (inaudible)",,
00:21:21.317,00:21:21.711,00:00:00.394,,,"so it would be three over eight times fourteen over eight (inaudible)",,"yeah"

00:21:48.293,00:21:49.985,00:00:01.692,,,,,"okay I'm going to start y up here"
00:21:52.024,00:21:53.033,00:00:01.009,,,"in forty-two",,
00:21:53.673,00:21:55.408,00:00:01.735,,,,,"forty or thirty"
00:21:56.307,00:21:57.322,00:00:01.015,,,"forty-two because it will be four plus four plus four equals twelve",,

00:22:10.230,00:22:12.158,00:00:01.928,,,"so then eight would go into forty-two",,

00:22:58.023,00:22:58.495,00:00:00.472,,,"you go first",,

00:23:03.092,00:23:05.542,00:00:02.450,,,"so eight and eight equals sixteen",,

00:23:09.775,00:23:11.992,00:00:02.217,,,"so then thirty-two plus eight equals forty",,
00:23:11.992,00:23:13.030,00:00:01.038,,,"so you can get the forty",,
00:23:13.263,00:23:13.628,00:00:00.365,,,,,"okay"
00:23:15.031,00:23:18.779,00:00:03.748,,,"so then it would be five times",,

00:44:25.275,00:44:28.282,00:00:03.007,,,,,"and this is multiply both sides by x"
00:44:29.704,00:44:30.570,00:00:00.866,,,"oh no no",,
00:44:31.912,00:44:31.942,00:00:00.030,,,,,"so if you multiply"
00:44:31.942,00:44:32.604,00:00:00.662,,,"(laughter)",,"so if you multiply"
00:44:32.604,00:44:34.429,00:00:01.825,,,,,"so if you multiply"
00:44:35.094,00:44:36.745,00:00:01.651,,,,,"wait this is what we're supposed to do"
00:44:36.852,00:44:39.530,00:00:02.678,,,,,"so as you multiply both sides by x"
00:44:39.530,00:44:39.624,00:00:00.094,,,"got it",,"so as you multiply both sides by x"
00:44:39.624,00:44:39.959,00:00:00.335,,,"got it",,
00:44:40.818,00:44:41.369,00:00:00.551,,,,,"you got it"

00:44:43.378,00:44:44.973,00:00:01.595,,,"because it would be twenty",,
00:44:44.973,00:44:45.297,00:00:00.324,,,"because it would be twenty",,"because this thing is"
00:44:45.297,00:44:45.861,00:00:00.564,,,,,"because this thing is"
00:44:47.114,00:44:48.486,00:00:01.372,,,,,"I don't know if you're supposed to do that"
00:44:48.502,00:44:50.166,00:00:01.664,,,,,"because it's the same set of"
00:44:50.231,00:44:54.216,00:00:03.985,,,,,"its two over x equals twenty"
00:44:54.293,00:44:57.915,00:00:03.622,,,,,"and then it says multiply both sides by x (inaudible)"
00:44:57.915,00:44:59.320,00:00:01.405,,,"but we have the fifty-four to before the k plus fifty-four",,"and then it says multiply both sides by x (inaudible)"

00:45:05.621,00:45:11.158,00:00:05.537,,,,,"yeah but that's the equation like we have right now like in the green"
00:45:12.417,00:45:14.000,00:00:01.583,,,,,"so I don't know if that would tell"
00:45:16.251,00:45:18.617,00:00:02.366,,,,,"but technically we would follow the same steps and then"
00:45:18.617,00:45:19.135,00:00:00.518,,,"oh that's okay",,"but technically we would follow the same steps and then"

00:45:22.347,00:45:28.031,00:00:05.684,,,,,"okay so divided by x so then if we would divide it by k"
00:45:30.818,00:45:31.756,00:00:00.938,,,,,"you would just be left with"
00:45:35.536,00:45:40.532,00:00:04.996,,,,,"if we do it this way we would be left with"
00:45:40.633,00:45:41.231,00:00:00.598,,,,,"was that four"
00:45:43.316,00:45:44.370,00:00:01.054,,,"there would be no remainder",,
00:45:45.119,00:45:45.316,00:00:00.197,,,,,"hmm"
00:45:46.081,00:45:47.077,00:00:00.996,,,"there will be no remainder",,
00:45:47.865,00:45:50.822,00:00:02.957,,,,,"for that one okay I'm just going to real quick do it this way"
00:45:50.822,00:45:51.872,00:00:01.050,,,,,"and see if you get the same answer"
00:45:55.177,00:45:56.164,00:00:00.987,,,"well you see what I did",,
00:45:56.164,00:46:04.566,00:00:08.402,,,"so (laughter) yeah let's break (laughter)",,
00:46:10.699,00:46:17.541,00:00:06.842,,,,,"(inaudible) equals sixty-two k"
00:46:24.938,00:46:25.541,00:00:00.603,,,"nice snails",,
00:46:26.497,00:46:28.114,00:00:01.617,,,,,"thanks I only did one hand"

00:46:31.133,00:46:31.472,00:00:00.339,,,"yeah that's me",,
00:46:32.114,00:46:56.032,00:00:23.918,,,,,"I know so divide both sides by twenty twenty sixty-two wait still worst sixty-two ever"
00:46:56.128,00:46:56.623,00:00:00.495,,,"(laughter)",,
00:46:57.881,00:47:01.346,00:00:03.465,,,,,"it says divide both sides by the number"
00:47:02.409,00:47:07.422,00:00:05.013,,,,,"and then we just (inaudible)"
00:47:07.422,00:47:08.585,00:00:01.163,,,,,"that makes no sense"
00:47:09.214,00:47:10.629,00:00:01.415,,,,,"oh I guess that does"
00:47:10.661,00:47:23.560,00:00:12.899,,,,,"then I get four over sixty-two equals k"
00:47:26.013,00:47:30.849,00:00:04.836,,,,,"and then you simplify the four over sixty-two by dividing it"
00:47:31.164,00:47:32.774,00:00:01.610,,,,,"which is what we did here"
00:47:33.139,00:47:34.812,00:00:01.673,,,,,"and you get one five five"
00:47:35.145,00:47:37.353,00:00:02.208,,,,,"so like we got the same answers"
00:47:37.365,00:47:38.862,00:00:01.497,,,,,"so this would be the answer"
00:47:39.805,00:47:42.277,00:00:02.472,,,,,"but we did it different ways"
00:47:42.604,00:47:42.774,00:00:00.170,,,"yeah",,
00:47:43.585,00:47:47.529,00:00:03.944,,,,,"okay but I don't think it really matters at this point because"
00:47:47.529,00:47:47.548,00:00:00.019,,,"(inaudible) (laughter) you made it a lot further last time",,"okay but I don't think it really matters at this point because"

00:48:08.636,00:48:12.881,00:00:04.245,,,,,"but it's just the order is switched I think"
