1,5,2,00:00:02.750,00:00:05.590,00:00:02.840,so pause filler what's new,
2,5,2,00:00:06.358,00:00:08.354,00:00:01.996,,pause filler nothing really
3,5,2,00:00:10.369,00:00:13.138,00:00:02.769,(laughter) well I'm just planning of making my new video ,
4,5,2,00:00:13.162,00:00:15.131,00:00:01.969,pause filler about Pittsburgh history,
5,5,2,00:00:15.238,00:00:16.864,00:00:01.626,it's up like abridged,
6,5,2,00:00:17.253,00:00:20.316,00:00:03.063,so it's going to be like a really short,
7,5,2,00:00:20.396,00:00:24.257,00:00:03.861,and like I guess a little bit I don't know insulting,
8,5,2,00:00:24.796,00:00:26.283,00:00:01.487,and it's going to be like,
9,5,2,00:00:26.562,00:00:29.376,00:00:02.814,all right so the way Pittsburgh started yo,
10,5,2,00:00:29.376,00:00:33.047,00:00:03.671,it was just like so this brick bitch guy who just like,
11,5,2,00:00:33.097,00:00:35.023,00:00:01.926,he saw this like French colony,
12,5,2,00:00:35.023,00:00:35.811,00:00:00.788,he was like oh no,
13,5,2,00:00:35.811,00:00:37.098,00:00:01.287,this is owned by Pitt,
14,5,2,00:00:37.098,00:00:39.602,00:00:02.504,so he go and named it Pitt's bag without an h,
15,5,2,00:00:39.602,00:00:40.211,00:00:00.609,take note,
16,5,2,00:00:40.480,00:00:43.144,00:00:02.664,and you know so it's sort of something like that,
17,5,2,00:00:43.144,00:00:44.761,00:00:01.617,and I just started on this script,
18,5,2,00:00:45.489,00:00:46.547,00:00:01.058,and it's going to be pretty good,
19,5,2,00:00:47.505,00:00:48.073,00:00:00.568,,let's hope
20,5,2,00:00:48.602,00:00:54.958,00:00:06.356,yeah if it gets like a million views I'm going to be so happy,
21,5,2,00:00:55.866,00:00:58.220,00:00:02.354,,I think my highest number of views is twelve
22,5,2,00:00:59.747,00:01:05.075,00:00:05.328,pause filler mine is pause filler one thousand,
23,5,2,00:01:06.000,00:01:06.726,00:00:00.726,,(inaudible)
24,5,2,00:01:06.611,00:01:08.676,00:00:02.065,yeah that's a lot,
25,5,2,00:01:10.782,00:01:12.617,00:00:01.835,,I got to start working on stuff
26,5,2,00:01:12.867,00:01:14.463,00:00:01.596,yeah again,
27,5,2,00:01:14.513,00:01:21.208,00:00:06.695,and my second was like at least three hundred views yeah,
28,5,2,00:01:21.208,00:01:23.193,00:00:01.985,,that's actually like a pretty wide gap
29,5,2,00:01:24.231,00:01:26.556,00:00:02.325,,three thousand and pause filler three hundred
30,5,2,00:01:26.656,00:01:38.559,00:00:11.903,yeah it was only because I pause filler basically there's this video of this kid who was just banned from like a game that I play,
31,5,2,00:01:39.157,00:01:43.278,00:00:04.121,and like it was really famous across the website,
32,5,2,00:01:44.046,00:01:46.560,00:00:02.514,and I got the video of him like swearing up the camera,
33,5,2,00:01:46.560,00:01:48.057,00:00:01.497,it was so funny,
34,5,2,00:01:48.366,00:01:50.761,00:00:02.395,and I got like a thousand views off,
35,5,2,00:01:50.761,00:01:51.958,00:00:01.197,and I was like yes,
36,5,2,00:01:53.325,00:01:57.476,00:00:04.151,,pause filler I got to figure out how to do some of that stuff so
37,5,2,00:01:57.815,00:01:58.284,00:00:00.469,oh,
38,5,2,00:01:59.551,00:02:04.599,00:00:05.048,there's other like for people like you like pause filler,
39,5,2,00:02:05.318,00:02:10.316,00:00:04.998,there's many ways of creating videos and getting lots of views,
40,5,2,00:02:10.316,00:02:17.700,00:00:07.384,somehow like you could pause filler talk about a guy who pause filler were a lot of things just happened to him,
41,5,2,00:02:17.749,00:02:19.855,00:00:02.106,pause filler you can pull off a DramaAlert,
42,5,2,00:02:19.855,00:02:22.678,00:00:02.823,you could pause filler you know him DramaAlert,
43,5,2,00:02:22.938,00:02:23.327,00:00:00.389,,no
44,5,2,00:02:23.736,00:02:27.517,00:00:03.781,he's basically just this guy on the internet that nobody likes,
45,5,2,00:02:27.517,00:02:30.500,00:00:02.983,and he talks about YouTube news quote unquote,
46,5,2,00:02:30.969,00:02:35.978,00:00:05.009,and he just overdramatizes everything on the website,
47,5,2,00:02:35.978,00:02:41.485,00:00:05.507,so you can pull off a thing like that pause filler you can make anime music videos,
48,5,2,00:02:42.493,00:02:43.261,00:00:00.768,,oh yeah
49,5,2,00:02:43.261,00:02:48.300,00:00:05.039,,I think I was doing something like that a while ago
50,5,2,00:02:48.300,00:02:49.967,00:00:01.667,,but I totally forgot about it
51,5,2,00:02:50.037,00:02:53.728,00:00:03.691,yeah yeah it's something I don't really like,
52,5,2,00:02:53.728,00:02:56.821,00:00:03.093,but it's what you people can do to get a lot of views somehow,
53,5,2,00:02:56.871,00:03:03.665,00:00:06.794,but anyway there's pause filler you could try to be nice and original like me,
54,5,2,00:03:03.665,00:03:07.766,00:00:04.101,but oh if that won't get you a lot of views because well because it's YouTube,
55,5,2,00:03:07.766,00:03:10.420,00:00:02.654,you know there's pause filler what else pause filler,
56,5,2,00:03:15.410,00:03:17.124,00:00:01.714,what's this thing that can get you a lot of views,
57,5,2,00:03:17.314,00:03:17.663,00:00:00.349,oh yeah,
58,5,2,00:03:17.663,00:03:20.168,00:00:02.505,game plays but that's like,
59,5,2,00:03:21.286,00:03:24.368,00:00:03.082,you have to be like one in a hundred in order to get popular,
60,5,2,00:03:25.007,00:03:25.416,00:00:00.409,,yeah
61,5,2,00:03:25.635,00:03:36.885,00:00:11.250,yeah like you're only like you're either popular or not popular which is really bad about the YouTube system with that,
62,5,2,00:03:37.665,00:03:43.874,00:00:06.209,pause filler so I just hit three thousand views on my channel,
63,5,2,00:03:43.874,00:03:47.017,00:00:03.143,so it's working on pretty well for me,
64,5,2,00:03:47.017,00:03:49.122,00:00:02.105,and I have thirty-two subscribers,
65,5,2,00:03:49.740,00:03:54.200,00:00:04.460,so it's going to it's probably going to start working out well soon,
66,5,2,00:03:54.200,00:03:58.281,00:00:04.081,I just got to figure out a way to set up like a good video system,
67,5,2,00:03:58.341,00:04:01.983,00:00:03.642,something that everyone likes which is,
68,5,2,00:04:01.983,00:04:06.313,00:00:04.330,,it's really hard to figure what people want from you on YouTube
69,5,2,00:04:06.792,00:04:14.953,00:00:08.161,yeah like I figured out that pause filler ranting about a bunch of pause filler random people actually works really well,
70,5,2,00:04:14.953,00:04:17.797,00:00:02.844,like those are series that I did for a little bit,
71,5,2,00:04:17.797,00:04:19.303,00:00:01.506,it was called the Internet filth,
72,5,2,00:04:19.842,00:04:24.132,00:00:04.290,and basically what I did is that I went onto like DeviantArt or YouTube,
73,5,2,00:04:24.132,00:04:31.532,00:00:07.400,and I just like ranted on like a bunch of like I don't know crap that they drew or something or,
74,5,2,00:04:31.565,00:04:37.363,00:00:05.798, pause filler or about like what they what kind of ideas they post,
75,5,2,00:04:38.350,00:04:42.740,00:00:04.390,and I'm not sure if you're aware of the Five Nights Of Freddy's Phantom,
76,5,2,00:04:42.740,00:04:47.250,00:00:04.510,but there was this guy named pause filler Smike,
77,5,2,00:04:48.577,00:04:54.403,00:00:05.826,and what he did is that he basically just made a bunch of top tens about like the characters,
78,5,2,00:04:54.403,00:04:58.344,00:00:03.941,and it was basically like every single one of those videos and,
79,5,2,00:05:02.705,00:05:03.952,00:00:01.247,,all right we're going to start
80,5,2,00:05:05.408,00:05:06.965,00:00:01.557,wait where's my paper,
81,5,2,00:05:14.643,00:05:15.805,00:00:01.162,oh there's my paper,
82,5,2,00:05:39.990,00:05:43.372,00:00:03.382,I usually don't need it for this round,
83,5,2,00:05:43.172,00:05:43.488,00:00:00.316,,oh yeah
84,5,2,00:05:49.758,00:05:52.711,00:00:02.953,,yeah I'm guessing like it cuts out for
85,5,2,00:05:55.485,00:05:56.143,00:00:00.658,it's okay,
86,5,2,00:05:59.762,00:06:00.462,00:00:00.700,do I need it,
87,5,2,00:06:16.879,00:06:17.594,00:00:00.715,all right,
88,5,2,00:06:22.605,00:06:22.864,00:00:00.259,got it,
89,5,2,00:06:34.835,00:06:52.026,00:00:17.191,,all right
90,5,2,00:06:59.558,00:07:06.294,00:00:06.736,all right so I'm the one tutoring you right,
91,5,2,00:07:06.503,00:07:06.812,00:00:00.309,,yeah
92,5,2,00:07:06.912,00:07:09.596,00:00:02.684,all right kid so I'm just making sure,
93,5,2,00:07:09.596,00:07:13.507,00:00:03.911,because there might have been some sudden change that I'm not aware about,
94,5,2,00:07:13.627,00:07:15.722,00:00:02.095,so I just got to get the green pen,
95,5,2,00:07:17.039,00:07:19.454,00:00:02.415,all right you see what you're doing here right,
96,5,2,00:07:20.342,00:07:20.990,00:00:00.648,,sort of
97,5,2,00:07:22.537,00:07:30.419,00:00:07.882,basically all you have to do is multiply one of these numbers to the other side,
98,5,2,00:07:32.594,00:07:36.216,00:00:03.622,,all right wouldn't that be the three over seven
99,5,2,00:07:36.565,00:07:37.104,00:00:00.539,yeah,
100,5,2,00:07:38.012,00:07:38.480,00:00:00.468,,okay
101,5,2,00:07:39.738,00:07:45.604,00:00:05.866,but what do you do once you pause filler get the three over seven onto the other side,
102,5,2,00:07:46.642,00:07:49.485,00:00:02.843,,you multiply it by four over one
103,5,2,00:07:50.773,00:07:51.870,00:00:01.097,forty over one,
104,5,2,00:07:52.199,00:07:57.238,00:00:05.039,,yeah that's right so we'll do that
105,5,2,00:07:57.338,00:07:59.593,00:00:02.255,,I'm just going to leave that
106,5,2,00:08:00.141,00:08:09.181,00:00:09.040,,now I'm going to screw that there somewhere
107,5,2,00:08:09.181,00:08:10.508,00:00:01.327,,this going to be
108,5,2,00:08:18.363,00:08:18.769,00:00:00.406,all right,
109,5,2,00:08:18.769,00:08:20.774,00:00:02.005,,so I got to simplify that
110,5,2,00:08:21.772,00:08:23.359,00:00:01.587,yeah you got to simplify it,
111,5,2,00:08:24.147,00:08:28.806,00:00:04.659,,so we'll do a quick division thing over here
112,5,2,00:08:29.305,00:08:44.371,00:00:15.066,yeah you know what this should be really good for,
113,5,2,00:08:44.820,00:08:45.189,00:00:00.369,,what
114,5,2,00:08:45.688,00:08:47.274,00:00:01.586,messing around with your friends,
115,5,2,00:08:47.274,00:08:51.584,00:00:04.310,like you just make one board and just keep drawing all over it,
116,5,2,00:08:52.153,00:08:55.346,00:00:03.193,,oh yeah that actually will be fun to do
117,5,2,00:08:55.346,00:09:00.065,00:00:04.719,yeah but first we got to test it to make sure it works,
118,5,2,00:09:01.103,00:09:01.522,00:00:00.419,,yeah
119,5,2,00:09:02.210,00:09:02.729,00:00:00.519,yeah,
120,5,2,00:09:08.835,00:09:11.419,00:00:02.584,,oh look at that
121,5,2,00:09:12.018,00:09:18.004,00:00:05.986,,this would be yes
122,5,2,00:09:20.139,00:09:25.547,00:00:05.408,,does that look right
123,5,2,00:09:26.355,00:09:27.393,00:00:01.038,yeah that looks all right,
124,5,2,00:09:27.393,00:09:28.880,00:00:01.487,so I'm just going to do that,
125,5,2,00:09:28.880,00:09:32.621,00:00:03.741,all right good job,
126,5,2,00:09:32.621,00:09:32.900,00:00:00.279,oh,
127,5,2,00:09:37.490,00:09:40.433,00:00:02.943,(inaudible) all right good yeah,
128,5,2,00:09:41.591,00:09:46.270,00:00:04.679,she was just giving me the tutoring paper and a pen,
129,5,2,00:09:46.400,00:09:50.151,00:00:03.751,all right so now you're on the next page now,
130,5,2,00:09:50.920,00:10:01.136,00:00:10.216,,all right so I'm going to cross that three over eight fourteen over one three
131,5,2,00:10:01.735,00:10:04.359,00:00:02.624,,that's an ugly three but we'll leave it
132,5,2,00:10:05.077,00:10:09.158,00:00:04.081,yeah they'll know what it is once they look over this,
133,5,2,00:10:14.805,00:10:28.823,00:00:14.018,,fourteen twenty-eight fifty-two no yeah fifty-two no forty-two
134,5,2,00:10:28.853,00:10:30.090,00:00:01.237,,that's right
135,5,2,00:10:30.090,00:10:31.827,00:00:01.737,,I knew I was missing something
136,5,2,00:10:33.902,00:10:47.361,00:00:13.459,,so you can go with forty-two five times two over eight which would also equal
137,5,2,00:10:49.000,00:10:49.362,00:00:00.362,(sfx),
138,5,2,00:10:49.885,00:10:50.454,00:00:00.569,,bless you
139,5,2,00:10:50.754,00:10:58.805,00:00:08.051,thanks I'm trying to erase this,
140,5,2,00:11:07.585,00:11:09.212,00:00:01.627,I'm like really tired this morning,
141,5,2,00:11:09.212,00:11:16.156,00:00:06.944,that's why I put that giant mark up here and like smashing my face against the board,
142,5,2,00:11:18.600,00:11:22.771,00:00:04.171,,does anything look right
143,5,2,00:11:21.291,00:11:28.044,00:00:06.753,pause filler it should be k equals something,
144,5,2,00:11:27.869,00:11:29.575,00:00:01.706,,yeah that's right
145,5,2,00:11:29.575,00:11:30.793,00:00:01.218,,I forgot about the k
146,5,2,00:11:36.037,00:11:38.295,00:00:02.258,yeah so it wouldn't be that it be this,
147,5,2,00:11:38.295,00:11:50.448,00:00:12.153,so the reason why I'm so tired today is because I was up until like twelve thirty working on this script all right,
148,5,2,00:11:51.106,00:11:55.806,00:00:04.700,but I was also at an opera show,
149,5,2,00:11:55.806,00:12:00.186,00:00:04.380,and at that opera show it was really long,
150,5,2,00:12:00.186,00:12:04.915,00:00:04.729,so I was really tired and,
151,5,2,00:12:05.633,00:12:06.441,00:00:00.808,,you go to opera
152,5,2,00:12:07.125,00:12:10.263,00:00:03.138,no I went to an opera with my class because I had to,
153,5,2,00:12:10.592,00:12:11.370,00:00:00.778,,oh
154,5,2,00:12:11.600,00:12:13.525,00:00:01.925,and I was up until twelve thirty,
155,5,2,00:12:13.855,00:12:16.928,00:00:03.073,and do you know what the funniest part was,
156,5,2,00:12:17.407,00:12:17.706,00:00:00.299,,what
157,5,2,00:12:18.699,00:12:23.014,00:00:04.315,pause filler I was like thinking about you the entire time,
158,5,2,00:12:23.014,00:12:25.578,00:00:02.564,and it was for the weirdest reason,
159,5,2,00:12:25.788,00:12:29.449,00:00:03.661,you know how like it's basically yesterday,
160,5,2,00:12:29.449,00:12:34.957,00:00:05.508,there's like this weird comicon for like Japanese like the anime con like,
161,5,2,00:12:36.204,00:12:37.401,00:00:01.197,,oh my gosh
162,5,2,00:12:37.910,00:12:47.937,00:00:10.027,and like I was (laughter) like it was like I was talking to my dad like the Uber that we had,
163,5,2,00:12:48.436,00:12:51.988,00:00:03.552,and it's basically at this car service,
164,5,2,00:12:51.988,00:12:55.769,00:00:03.781,and we saw like all the weird people,
165,5,2,00:12:55.819,00:12:58.523,00:00:02.704,and we were like I was like oh my goodness,
166,5,2,00:12:59.381,00:13:00.908,00:00:01.527,and like what did the Uber driver,
167,5,2,00:13:00.908,00:13:06.814,00:00:05.906,he said we had these people in like full costumes in our pause filler in our cars,
168,5,2,00:13:06.814,00:13:08.361,00:00:01.547,and he said I'm like oh my gosh,
169,5,2,00:13:08.361,00:13:10.047,00:00:01.686,I'm afraid of sitting here now,
170,5,2,00:13:10.127,00:13:16.093,00:00:05.966,and all right here comes the best part,
171,5,2,00:13:16.093,00:13:21.820,00:00:05.727,so once we and dad were going to another street corner so we could easily be picked up like,
172,5,2,00:13:22.349,00:13:24.754,00:00:02.405,we saw a bunch of police officers (laughter),
173,5,2,00:13:27.298,00:13:31.069,00:00:03.771,no this is like going where you think it's going all right but,
174,5,2,00:13:31.149,00:13:33.514,00:00:02.365,pause filler there's just a bunch of police cars over here,
175,5,2,00:13:33.514,00:13:36.138,00:00:02.624,they're like three in a row all right,
176,5,2,00:13:36.307,00:13:36.836,00:00:00.529,,why
177,5,2,00:13:37.774,00:13:38.353,00:00:00.579,I don't know,
178,5,2,00:13:38.353,00:13:40.258,00:00:01.905,but I decided to make a joke,
179,5,2,00:13:40.837,00:13:45.207,00:00:04.370,because a lot of them were like wearing like short skirts,
180,5,2,00:13:45.207,00:13:49.757,00:00:04.550,and I was like hey that's not eww that's wow,
181,5,2,00:13:49.817,00:13:56.082,00:00:06.265,and I was like I told you the weeaboo prostitutes were out tonight,
182,5,2,00:13:56.950,00:13:58.557,00:00:01.607,that's what I said to my dad,
183,5,2,00:14:00.977,00:14:03.545,00:00:02.568,and he was like well you're right Jordan,
184,5,2,00:14:03.545,00:14:04.643,00:00:01.098,I'm like yes,
185,5,2,00:14:05.152,00:14:08.115,00:00:02.963,because it was so funny,
186,5,2,00:14:08.344,00:14:12.176,00:00:03.832,like I knew this would happened like sometime at that night,
187,5,2,00:14:13.872,00:14:17.703,00:00:03.831,,jeez Pittsburgh is getting weird and fast
188,5,2,00:14:18.352,00:14:26.503,00:00:08.151,no it's just like Pittsburgh had like and that's what I'm doing in my pause filler like abridged Pittsburgh history,
189,5,2,00:14:26.812,00:14:31.312,00:00:04.500,and then it's like basically nothing really happens from the thirtys to two thousands,
190,5,2,00:14:31.312,00:14:34.295,00:00:02.983,until the furries came and ruined everything for us,
191,5,2,00:14:34.425,00:14:41.988,00:00:07.563,and every time that like a furry or anything related comes to this town I get severely afraid so,
192,5,2,00:14:42.257,00:14:48.383,00:00:06.126,and then I made like this short segment where I made an open letter to the furries and anything related,
193,5,2,00:14:49.182,00:14:52.873,00:00:03.691,,furries those things are kind of creepy if you think about it
194,5,2,00:14:52.873,00:14:55.647,00:00:02.774,they're even creepier if you go onto the Internet,
195,5,2,00:14:55.846,00:15:08.178,00:00:12.332,like if you are a true a larker like me you furries are like weirder than they are in a costume,
196,5,2,00:15:09.446,00:15:12.798,00:00:03.352,like I don't think you'd understand because,
197,5,2,00:15:13.888,00:15:17.388,00:00:03.500,all right so let's get back on topic to see what you're doing here,
198,5,2,00:15:17.388,00:15:18.914,00:00:01.526,because I'm getting really curious,
199,5,2,00:15:19.312,00:15:21.558,00:00:02.246,all right so what you did is you add it onto that,
200,5,2,00:15:21.558,00:15:23.374,00:00:01.816,and you got seventy right,
201,5,2,00:15:23.554,00:15:23.873,00:00:00.319,,yeah
202,5,2,00:15:25.230,00:15:28.931,00:00:03.701,and then what's this,
203,5,2,00:15:31.027,00:15:33.644,00:00:02.617,,that is y I messed it up pretty badly
204,5,2,00:15:34.559,00:15:36.195,00:00:01.636,why did you put a y there,
205,5,2,00:15:37.193,00:15:39.817,00:00:02.624,,pause filler because you're supposed to multiply the ys right
206,5,2,00:15:40.016,00:15:42.670,00:00:02.654,,because you multiply y here
207,5,2,00:15:42.670,00:15:44.376,00:00:01.706,,and the y would cancel out
208,5,2,00:15:44.676,00:15:46.501,00:00:01.825,,and those two multiply on this side
209,5,2,00:15:47.040,00:15:49.325,00:00:02.285,,and maybe you just add y seventy
210,5,2,00:15:49.904,00:15:56.369,00:00:06.465,pause filler right so pause filler what you do is that correct,
211,5,2,00:16:00.240,00:16:00.617,00:00:00.377,no,
212,5,2,00:16:05.927,00:16:10.896,00:00:04.969,all right so one hundred and forty over three,
213,5,2,00:16:11.355,00:16:14.099,00:00:02.744,and then you're dividing three by one hundred four,
214,5,2,00:16:14.099,00:16:15.685,00:00:01.586,and four divided by three,
215,5,2,00:16:15.685,00:16:17.730,00:00:02.045,all right do what you're doing there here,
216,5,2,00:16:20.414,00:16:20.763,00:00:00.349,,where
217,5,2,00:16:21.941,00:16:23.068,00:00:01.127,pause filler this,
218,5,2,00:16:24.705,00:16:29.154,00:00:04.449,,oh okay so that's twenty
219,5,2,00:16:30.871,00:16:36.827,00:00:05.956,,I can get this eighty well this nine eight
220,5,2,00:16:37.585,00:16:41.826,00:00:04.241,,I'm not good at drawing in small spaces
221,5,2,00:16:41.905,00:16:43.083,00:00:01.178,,there we're going to leave it there
222,5,2,00:16:44.440,00:16:46.435,00:00:01.995,,and we're going to have a left over two
223,5,2,00:16:49.458,00:16:50.725,00:00:01.267,,you can't even really see it from here
224,5,2,00:16:50.725,00:16:52.611,00:00:01.886,,because the bar down here blocks it
225,5,2,00:16:53.310,00:16:53.908,00:00:00.598,what bar,
226,5,2,00:16:54.397,00:16:56.638,00:00:02.241,,there's a bar that moves the screen side to side
227,5,2,00:16:59.022,00:17:03.657,00:00:04.635,oh pause filler I don't have it,
228,5,2,00:17:05.023,00:17:05.781,00:00:00.758,,mine does
229,5,2,00:17:06.978,00:17:12.436,00:00:05.458,oh pause filler ah weird pause filler,
230,5,2,00:17:13.294,00:17:15.854,00:00:02.560,I don't even have a scroller,
231,5,2,00:17:17.978,00:17:20.907,00:00:02.929,,actually now I do not have one either
232,5,2,00:17:21.715,00:17:28.290,00:00:06.575,,ah that is odd pause filler
233,5,2,00:17:46.338,00:17:50.849,00:00:04.511,pause filler well can you fit the rest of the problem there,
234,5,2,00:17:53.223,00:17:56.306,00:00:03.083,,no I have no space to write
235,5,2,00:17:55.846,00:17:58.282,00:00:02.436,well I do,
236,5,2,00:17:58.282,00:17:58.930,00:00:00.648,,that's weird
237,5,2,00:17:59.519,00:17:59.918,00:00:00.399,see,
238,5,2,00:18:02.568,00:18:05.954,00:00:03.386,,I'm going to move it over here and have the twenty
239,5,2,00:18:06.064,00:18:08.479,00:00:02.415,wait wait wait there,
240,5,2,00:18:09.676,00:18:13.946,00:00:04.270,,okay so we're going to have the twenty over here
241,5,2,00:18:15.193,00:18:17.448,00:00:02.255,,and then minus the eighteen
242,5,2,00:18:18.925,00:18:20.302,00:00:01.377,no that's infinite pause filler,
243,5,2,00:18:20.930,00:18:23.475,00:00:02.545,,yeah so then you would have two over three because
244,5,2,00:18:23.475,00:18:25.470,00:00:01.995,you'd put the line over the three,
245,5,2,00:18:28.603,00:18:30.968,00:00:02.365,,no but wouldn't that be with decimals
246,5,2,00:18:32.195,00:18:34.061,00:00:01.866,oh that yeah that would be with decimals,
247,5,2,00:18:34.061,00:18:40.027,00:00:05.966,but oh wait I'm totally lost here now,
248,5,2,00:18:40.237,00:18:42.890,00:00:02.653,,yeah I'm a little confused
249,5,2,00:18:42.960,00:18:49.875,00:00:06.915,,I think if it's infinite you just put like two over three to show that it can never be simplified to a whole number
250,5,2,00:18:49.934,00:18:51.750,00:00:01.816,yeah so that's what I was thinking,
251,5,2,00:18:51.750,00:18:54.005,00:00:02.255,so just write the,
252,5,2,00:18:54.424,00:18:59.523,00:00:05.099,,yeah so in the end I got like negative forty-six to over three equalsy
253,5,2,00:18:59.842,00:19:01.488,00:00:01.646,all right,
254,5,2,00:19:02.875,00:19:03.434,00:00:00.559,,okay
255,5,2,00:19:05.143,00:19:06.826,00:00:01.683,all right (inaudible) but that's over right,
256,5,2,00:19:06.826,00:19:07.495,00:00:00.669,all right pause filler,
257,5,2,00:19:08.492,00:19:12.904,00:00:04.412,that's a really good checkmark,
258,5,2,00:19:13.714,00:19:14.499,00:00:00.785,,yeah
259,5,2,00:19:14.905,00:19:21.822,00:00:06.917,all right what you do is you subtract thirteen basically,
260,5,2,00:19:22.391,00:19:25.015,00:00:02.624,because this is a plus you see,
261,5,2,00:19:25.963,00:19:26.232,00:00:00.269,,yeah
262,5,2,00:19:27.300,00:19:27.669,00:00:00.369,yeah,
263,5,2,00:19:28.487,00:19:36.409,00:00:07.922,,so well technically what I could just do here is that I can just wipe whoa I can just wipe about the thirteen and then
264,5,2,00:19:36.638,00:19:37.915,00:00:01.277,,oh why is that weird
265,5,2,00:19:38.823,00:19:43.303,00:00:04.480,,and I can just turn the forty-four into a thirty-one
266,5,2,00:19:45.458,00:19:47.164,00:00:01.706,,that saves up a whole lot of room
267,5,2,00:19:47.683,00:19:48.362,00:00:00.679,indeed,
268,5,2,00:19:53.759,00:19:56.962,00:00:03.203,,I want to redo that and pause filler
269,5,2,00:19:57.840,00:20:00.464,00:00:02.624,,okay no give me my two
270,5,2,00:20:00.734,00:20:06.939,00:00:06.205,,there we go there there okay
271,5,2,00:20:07.029,00:20:07.588,00:00:00.559,,stay there
272,5,2,00:20:08.775,00:20:12.387,00:00:03.612,,now we need to multiply the x
273,5,2,00:20:13.554,00:20:19.082,00:00:05.528,,so technically we would get one over two would equal thirty
274,5,2,00:20:22.524,00:20:29.618,00:00:07.094,,yeah so now we have to bring the thirty-one over to the one over two and multiply that to get the
275,5,2,00:20:31.075,00:20:31.713,00:00:00.638,pause filler hold on,
276,5,2,00:20:32.841,00:20:41.082,00:00:08.241,all right you got thirty-one over two right,
277,5,2,00:20:41.461,00:20:41.730,00:00:00.269,,yeah
278,5,2,00:20:42.209,00:20:42.658,00:00:00.449,yeah,
279,5,2,00:20:43.287,00:20:52.636,00:00:09.349,,so then fifteen one over two
280,5,2,00:20:52.636,00:20:53.713,00:00:01.077,,because you got one left
281,5,2,00:20:54.352,00:20:57.874,00:00:03.522,,well gave me an extra line
282,5,2,00:21:00.777,00:21:02.014,00:00:01.237,,just give me that
283,5,2,00:21:03.251,00:21:03.551,00:00:00.300,,there
284,5,2,00:21:06.810,00:21:11.163,00:00:04.353,pause filler oh my god I'm so tired,
285,5,2,00:21:11.163,00:21:20.962,00:00:09.799,pause filler fifteen and a half correct,
286,5,2,00:21:37.370,00:21:40.800,00:00:03.430,all right all right,
287,5,2,00:21:41.163,00:21:41.844,00:00:00.681,oh my gosh,
288,5,2,00:21:41.844,00:21:45.017,00:00:03.173,I'm sick of these problems please,
289,5,2,00:21:45.017,00:21:45.765,00:00:00.748,,I know
290,5,2,00:21:45.765,00:21:47.830,00:00:02.065,,so eliminate that
291,5,2,00:21:47.830,00:21:49.257,00:00:01.427,,we're just going to add sixteen
292,5,2,00:21:49.257,00:21:53.028,00:00:03.771,,so that becomes forty-seven
293,5,2,00:21:58.725,00:22:00.551,00:00:01.826,,so multiply the x
294,5,2,00:22:03.963,00:22:05.690,00:00:01.727,,I'll move that down a little bit more
295,5,2,00:22:15.028,00:22:22.352,00:00:07.324,,well that's weird equals
296,5,2,00:22:26.322,00:22:28.627,00:00:02.305,,oh jeez now I have to actually do some math
297,5,2,00:22:29.795,00:22:31.440,00:00:01.645,,what's forty-seven times three
298,5,2,00:22:35.000,00:22:35.974,00:00:00.974,pause filler,
299,5,2,00:22:39.044,00:22:44.312,00:00:05.268,,forty-seven ninety-four
300,5,2,00:22:47.774,00:22:52.064,00:00:04.290,,no wait
301,5,2,00:22:52.314,00:22:56.863,00:00:04.549,,first we're actually multiplying forty-seven over one
302,5,2,00:22:56.863,00:22:58.889,00:00:02.026,I'm going to pull out the calculator,
303,5,2,00:23:00.425,00:23:02.151,00:00:01.726,wait why didn't make,
304,5,2,00:23:03.837,00:23:06.042,00:00:02.205,oh you got to be kidding me,
305,5,2,00:23:06.042,00:23:09.235,00:00:03.193,,I think they have like a lock on it
306,5,2,00:23:12.917,00:23:14.653,00:00:01.736,oh no we can't cheat,
307,5,2,00:23:14.723,00:23:15.800,00:00:01.077,ding it all right,
308,5,2,00:23:16.738,00:23:18.843,00:00:02.105,,I was let me do it quickly
309,5,2,00:23:24.101,00:23:24.929,00:00:00.828,,top there pause filler
310,5,2,00:23:27.324,00:23:36.423,00:00:09.099,,twenty-one to twelve for one forty-one over six
311,5,2,00:23:38.578,00:23:43.008,00:00:04.430,with six all right,
312,5,2,00:23:43.008,00:23:44.914,00:00:01.906,and then it's just six to the infinite,
313,5,2,00:23:44.914,00:23:49.933,00:00:05.019,so that's what I get,
314,5,2,00:23:50.531,00:23:55.087,00:00:04.556,,all right I'm going to see if this would work here well
315,5,2,00:24:15.532,00:24:17.520,00:00:01.988,,and this would be a two
316,5,2,00:24:19.547,00:24:23.596,00:00:04.049,,so this should be two over six
317,5,2,00:24:24.225,00:24:31.650,00:00:07.425,,so technically you would have twenty twenty-three
318,5,2,00:24:36.971,00:24:38.000,00:00:01.029,,all right that's what I get
319,5,2,00:24:56.503,00:24:57.190,00:00:00.687,I think (sfx),
320,5,2,00:25:17.540,00:25:19.439,00:00:01.899,I don't see the sixty-one,
321,5,2,00:25:21.016,00:25:23.231,00:00:02.215,there should be a sixty-one in this problem,
322,5,2,00:25:25.396,00:25:27.790,00:00:02.394,,okay let's see sixty plus sixty-one
323,5,2,00:25:28.898,00:25:35.163,00:00:06.265,because you see here this,
324,5,2,00:25:35.712,00:25:36.032,00:00:00.320,,yeah
325,5,2,00:25:37.032,00:25:52.554,00:00:15.522,all right so whenever you whenever you multiply them both sides you got to do six over three,
326,5,2,00:25:55.188,00:26:00.077,00:00:04.889,and then six over three,
327,5,2,00:26:03.397,00:26:11.710,00:00:08.313,and then you have one hundred eighty-six over three see,
328,5,2,00:26:12.678,00:26:13.716,00:00:01.038,,oh yeah
329,5,2,00:26:14.374,00:26:21.249,00:00:06.875,so we might have to redo this problem all over again so here,
330,5,2,00:26:21.728,00:26:23.184,00:00:01.456,I'll just erase it all all right,
331,5,2,00:26:23.853,00:26:24.292,00:00:00.439,,okay
332,5,2,00:26:33.471,00:26:34.788,00:00:01.317,oh I'm erasing the problem,
333,5,2,00:26:34.788,00:26:35.127,00:00:00.339,dang it,
334,5,2,00:27:05.329,00:27:06.256,00:00:00.927,oh my gosh,
335,5,2,00:27:13.582,00:27:28.167,00:00:14.585,all right,
336,5,2,00:27:29.234,00:27:31.070,00:00:01.836,it's like a blank slate,
337,5,2,00:27:32.207,00:27:38.254,00:00:06.047,,yeah so yeah so six times thirty-one
338,5,2,00:27:41.387,00:27:47.483,00:00:06.096,six over three six over three times pause filler,
339,5,2,00:27:51.733,00:27:53.499,00:00:01.766,,pause filler we're on the fifth
340,5,2,00:28:01.910,00:28:03.407,00:00:01.497,hey what candy,
341,5,2,00:28:03.636,00:28:03.965,00:00:00.329,,yeah
342,5,2,00:28:18.612,00:28:19.400,00:00:00.788,all right,
343,5,2,00:28:26.913,00:28:33.129,00:00:06.216,oh yeah I'm like really tired because I stayed until like pause filler twelve o'clock last night,
344,5,2,00:28:33.977,00:28:37.429,00:00:03.452,yeah we had an opera to go to,
345,5,2,00:28:37.429,00:28:39.036,00:00:01.607,and we got home at twelve,
346,5,2,00:28:39.036,00:28:41.211,00:00:02.175,and I wanted to make a video for my YouTube,
347,5,2,00:28:41.290,00:28:42.927,00:00:01.637,and I wrote the script,
348,5,2,00:28:42.927,00:28:45.112,00:00:02.185,and I stayed up until like one in the morning so,
349,5,2,00:28:48.843,00:28:50.011,00:00:01.168,it's pretty random,
350,5,2,00:28:50.011,00:28:55.159,00:00:05.148,it's just not really like focused on one thing all right,
351,5,2,00:28:55.219,00:29:02.163,00:00:06.944,like whenever I feel like making I just make it,

380,5,2,00:30:57.100,00:31:03.697,00:00:06.597,pause filler I can see why people like Japanese cartoons,
381,5,2,00:31:03.697,00:31:08.975,00:00:05.278,but sometimes sometimes your fan base takes it a little bit too seriously,
382,5,2,00:31:09.324,00:31:09.683,00:00:00.359,,yeah
383,5,2,00:31:11.600,00:31:15.680,00:00:04.080,all right all right listen up,
384,5,2,00:31:16.917,00:31:25.637,00:00:08.720,sometimes you people or your fan base are like dresses up really hot,
385,5,2,00:31:25.637,00:31:28.480,00:00:02.843,and I have to be honest I'm sorry,
386,5,2,00:31:28.780,00:31:30.386,00:00:01.606,you people are down like weird,
387,5,2,00:31:30.695,00:31:32.811,00:00:02.116,,that is true that is very true
388,5,2,00:31:35.604,00:31:37.181,00:00:01.577,and it's sad,
389,5,2,00:31:37.290,00:31:39.575,00:00:02.285,it's almost sad but true you know,
390,5,2,00:31:40.084,00:31:40.653,00:00:00.569,,yeah
391,5,2,00:31:41.012,00:31:43.247,00:00:02.235,like you people are weird,
392,5,2,00:31:43.247,00:31:46.280,00:00:03.033,but sometimes you dress up really really hot,
393,5,2,00:31:46.510,00:31:54.451,00:00:07.941,and I never like I've talked to many people like you before,
394,5,2,00:31:55.260,00:31:56.307,00:00:01.047,you're just into it,
395,5,2,00:31:56.437,00:32:02.523,00:00:06.086,and I just see absolutely nothing wrong with that but pause filler,
396,5,2,00:32:02.523,00:32:06.833,00:00:04.310,,and many of those people that treat it almost like a religion
397,5,2,00:32:15.658,00:32:17.124,00:00:01.466,yeah not really weirdoes,
398,5,2,00:32:18.091,00:32:25.378,00:00:07.287,but weirdoes are the people that like basically you know the ones are sort of like you know like oh,
399,5,2,00:32:25.461,00:32:28.873,00:00:03.412,I got to watch it I got to watch it pause filler,
400,5,2,00:32:29.422,00:32:37.314,00:00:07.892,you know those are the kind you have the authority to insult almost but pause filler,
401,5,2,00:32:38.384,00:32:44.548,00:00:06.164,and then there are the ones that are just like downright like freaking radical weeaboos as I call it,
402,5,2,00:32:44.797,00:32:47.441,00:00:02.644,and they are just like always into it,
403,5,2,00:32:47.441,00:32:50.305,00:00:02.864,and there's obviously something wrong with them,
404,5,2,00:32:50.305,00:32:54.166,00:00:03.861,so you see what I'm saying,
405,5,2,00:32:54.166,00:32:57.678,00:00:03.512,,yeah like it's okay to like it
406,5,2,00:32:58.336,00:33:02.357,00:00:04.021,,but then it's constantly on their mind
407,5,2,00:33:02.806,00:33:03.165,00:00:00.359,yeah,
408,5,2,00:33:05.440,00:33:08.723,00:00:03.283,like I'm not really sure,
409,5,2,00:33:10.129,00:33:12.704,00:00:02.575,like there are sometimes these people that I meet,
410,5,2,00:33:13.153,00:33:17.782,00:00:04.629,and they're like oh I know a lot about Internet culture,
411,5,2,00:33:17.782,00:33:20.476,00:00:02.694,like I know way too much about Internet culture,
412,5,2,00:33:20.476,00:33:24.487,00:00:04.011,so I'm not sure if you know what an Otaku is,
413,5,2,00:33:24.996,00:33:25.794,00:00:00.798,and then they're like,
414,5,2,00:33:25.963,00:33:27.071,00:00:01.108,I'm an Otaku,
415,5,2,00:33:27.071,00:33:27.909,00:00:00.838,I'm not a weeaboo,
416,5,2,00:33:27.909,00:33:28.797,00:00:00.888,learn the difference,
417,5,2,00:33:28.797,00:33:34.654,00:00:05.857,and like imagine if you said to a kid like me who's like in no fan bases whatsoever,
418,5,2,00:33:34.654,00:33:38.934,00:00:04.280,as a matter of fact he tries to stay out of fan bases pause filler,
419,5,2,00:33:39.433,00:33:45.170,00:00:05.737,like you think they know the difference no you know,
420,5,2,00:33:45.808,00:33:50.338,00:00:04.530,,yeah it's like I like their show
421,5,2,00:33:51.346,00:33:53.800,00:00:02.454,,but let's talk about something else
422,5,2,00:33:54.129,00:33:56.893,00:00:02.764,,because I am tired of this now
423,5,2,00:33:57.242,00:34:03.568,00:00:06.326,yeah like you know there's this kid in my class,
424,5,2,00:34:04.516,00:34:08.517,00:00:04.001,it's just he's one of the hated kids in the class but,
425,5,2,00:34:08.696,00:34:14.264,00:00:05.568,all right I hate talking about this kid so much,
426,5,2,00:34:14.264,00:34:18.045,00:00:03.781,so basically his name is Gerome,
427,5,2,00:34:18.604,00:34:24.151,00:00:05.547,and basically he's an anime-watching,
428,5,2,00:34:24.151,00:34:28.561,00:00:04.410,he always talks about it all right,
429,5,2,00:34:28.781,00:34:30.337,00:00:01.556,that's what makes him a horrible kid,
430,5,2,00:34:30.427,00:34:33.400,00:00:02.973,but also in addition he's super annoying pause filler,
431,5,2,00:34:35.116,00:34:38.189,00:00:03.073,he has the ugliest girl in the class and,
432,5,2,00:34:38.778,00:34:40.085,00:00:01.307,,like seriously
433,5,2,00:34:40.275,00:34:44.006,00:00:03.731,yeah and pause filler here comes the top of it,
434,5,2,00:34:44.216,00:34:46.500,00:00:02.284,he said that he has no friends,
435,5,2,00:34:46.550,00:34:52.467,00:00:05.917,and he'll act depressed whenever he feels triggered,
436,5,2,00:34:54.033,00:34:56.817,00:00:02.784,,that sounds exactly like a kid in my class
437,5,2,00:34:57.066,00:35:00.030,00:00:02.964,,we took a vote nobody in the class like that
438,5,2,00:35:00.030,00:35:01.017,00:00:00.987,you have that one,
439,5,2,00:35:01.187,00:35:05.248,00:00:04.061,everyone in their class has that one kid that always acts depressed,
440,5,2,00:35:05.248,00:35:07.732,00:00:02.484,like yeah I'm so depressed you know,
441,5,2,00:35:07.962,00:35:08.251,00:00:00.289,,yeah
442,5,2,00:35:11.224,00:35:13.519,00:00:02.295,and they always lie and,
443,5,2,00:35:14.018,00:35:17.779,00:00:03.761,,yeah usually it's just like they don't have any self-confidence
444,5,2,00:35:19.625,00:35:21.311,00:00:01.686,I have no self-esteem,
445,5,2,00:35:21.311,00:35:26.260,00:00:04.949,but they have no self there are people that have no self-confidence,
446,5,2,00:35:26.799,00:35:27.098,00:00:00.299,,yeah
447,5,2,00:35:28.814,00:35:34.451,00:00:05.637,yeah I'm not yeah I'm not a liberal kid that has no self-esteem indeed,
448,5,2,00:35:36.008,00:35:39.340,00:00:03.332,,I usually just like sit in the corner and watch people do stuff
449,5,2,00:35:39.969,00:35:43.311,00:00:03.342,pause filler so you're the outcast kid,
450,5,2,00:35:43.800,00:35:45.756,00:00:01.956,,yeah don't care what people think of me
451,5,2,00:35:45.756,00:35:47.252,00:00:01.496,,I don't care what I do
452,5,2,00:35:47.731,00:35:55.204,00:00:07.473,yeah you know the difference about me being pause filler having no self-esteem is,
453,5,2,00:35:55.204,00:35:56.791,00:00:01.587,I'm not ready to speak up,
454,5,2,00:35:57.529,00:35:58.966,00:00:01.437,like that's a perk of mine,
455,5,2,00:36:01.131,00:36:09.133,00:00:08.002,I am like pause filler well I like a kid talking about this,
456,5,2,00:36:09.133,00:36:11.936,00:00:02.803,but I'm not sure if you're into it,
457,5,2,00:36:12.126,00:36:16.596,00:00:04.470,so please don't get offended but,
458,5,2,00:36:17.204,00:36:20.008,00:00:02.804,,actually I think we're starting
459,5,2,00:36:20.666,00:36:21.255,00:00:00.589,oh crap,
460,5,2,00:36:58.081,00:37:01.673,00:00:03.592,all right got it,
461,5,2,00:37:03.492,00:37:06.703,00:00:03.211,,all right so let's get started on this one
462,5,2,00:37:07.363,00:37:07.959,00:00:00.596,all right,
463,5,2,00:37:11.261,00:37:16.779,00:00:05.518,,now this one seems a little bit different than the other ones that we just previously did
464,5,2,00:37:16.000,00:37:16.725,00:00:00.725,mm-hmm,
465,5,2,00:37:18.325,00:37:25.469,00:00:07.144,,so you know how to like get this how to separate all this right
466,5,2,00:37:25.778,00:37:26.217,00:00:00.439,yeah,
467,5,2,00:37:26.477,00:37:26.597,00:00:00.120,,okay
468,5,2,00:37:35.057,00:37:36.706,00:00:01.649,oh you want me to do it all right,
469,5,2,00:37:37.116,00:37:37.773,00:00:00.657,,yeah yeah
470,5,2,00:37:43.313,00:37:46.325,00:00:03.012,,so I see over how you would do this real quick
471,5,2,00:37:58.424,00:38:00.330,00:00:01.906,and then you try to get this to the other side,
472,5,2,00:38:06.765,00:38:10.138,00:00:03.373,oh my gosh why is it tam okay,
473,5,2,00:38:12.871,00:38:13.540,00:00:00.669,,that's weird
474,5,2,00:38:15.286,00:38:15.954,00:00:00.668,that's better,
475,5,2,00:38:16.144,00:38:31.439,00:00:15.295,all right pause filler anyways what we were talking about before,
476,5,2,00:38:31.439,00:38:32.587,00:00:01.148,because they're not in here,
477,5,2,00:38:32.846,00:38:35.333,00:00:02.487,and that's good so pause filler,
478,5,2,00:38:35.333,00:38:45.238,00:00:09.905,I really I always love talking about like that one kid in the class you know,
479,5,2,00:38:45.617,00:38:46.006,00:00:00.389,,yeah
480,5,2,00:38:47.173,00:38:49.169,00:00:01.996,it's always like super funny,
481,5,2,00:38:50.169,00:38:52.282,00:00:02.113,because it's always usually really relatable,
482,5,2,00:38:53.240,00:38:57.999,00:00:04.759,which is pretty good because like,
483,5,2,00:38:59.007,00:39:03.866,00:00:04.859,name that one kid in your class just one,
484,5,2,00:39:06.230,00:39:07.916,00:00:01.686,,pause filler we have a kid who's too jolly
485,5,2,00:39:09.114,00:39:10.471,00:00:01.357,,way too jolly
486,5,2,00:39:11.179,00:39:13.474,00:00:02.295,you mean like isn't happy all the time,
487,5,2,00:39:14.282,00:39:15.120,00:00:00.838,,always
488,5,2,00:39:15.449,00:39:16.527,00:00:01.078,,very very annoying
489,5,2,00:39:19.300,00:39:23.571,00:00:04.271,well as Shel Silverstein once said,
490,5,2,00:39:24.060,00:39:25.546,00:00:01.486,if everyone in the world were happy,
491,5,2,00:39:25.546,00:39:28.090,00:00:02.544,it wouldn't be a great place would it,
492,5,2,00:39:28.709,00:39:29.078,00:00:00.369,,no
493,5,2,00:39:32.022,00:39:37.090,00:00:05.068,crap I can't zoom out what the heck,

498,5,2,00:39:49.821,00:39:51.477,00:00:01.656,they need to fix this program,
499,5,2,00:39:52.016,00:39:52.365,00:00:00.349,,yeah
500,5,2,00:39:54.032,00:39:55.348,00:00:01.316,I found a bug,
501,5,2,00:40:01.006,00:40:02.812,00:00:01.806,,alright can pause filler you do anything
502,5,2,00:40:03.879,00:40:05.336,00:00:01.457,I can do stuff see,
503,5,2,00:40:06.593,00:40:08.688,00:00:02.095,,oh all right
504,5,2,00:40:08.688,00:40:11.841,00:00:03.153,,as basically as long as you can write you're kind of good
505,5,2,00:40:12.071,00:40:12.779,00:00:00.708,all right,
506,5,2,00:40:14.066,00:40:20.831,00:00:06.765,,so yeah this is going to be the technically the same problem
507,5,2,00:40:22.200,00:40:22.906,00:00:00.706,all right,
508,5,2,00:40:23.056,00:40:24.163,00:00:01.107,except,
509,5,2,00:40:32.853,00:40:35.298,00:00:02.445,,yeah wow this are all hard so
510,5,2,00:40:35.747,00:40:37.373,00:00:01.626,yeah that's what I thought,
511,5,2,00:40:37.373,00:40:37.912,00:00:00.539,yeah,
512,5,2,00:40:38.071,00:40:40.047,00:00:01.976,,so just to give you a little heads up
513,5,2,00:40:40.087,00:40:43.928,00:00:03.841,,whenever you start you always want to get rid of this number
514,5,2,00:40:44.726,00:40:49.296,00:00:04.570,,but then you're also going to add it to this number
515,5,2,00:40:48.586,00:40:49.103,00:00:00.517,this one,
516,5,2,00:40:52.578,00:40:56.230,00:00:03.652,,and then yeah and then from there
517,5,2,00:40:56.230,00:40:57.807,00:00:01.577,,it looks really easy to get out of
518,5,2,00:40:58.774,00:41:01.109,00:00:02.335,no I don't want to print this page stop,
519,5,2,00:41:01.109,00:41:01.917,00:00:00.808,,(laughter) all right
520,5,2,00:41:01.917,00:41:08.961,00:00:07.044,why did my mom sign me up for this,
521,5,2,00:41:10.188,00:41:10.947,00:00:00.759,,you get money
522,5,2,00:41:12.094,00:41:13.162,00:00:01.068,right you get money,
523,5,2,00:41:13.162,00:41:15.925,00:00:02.763,but she says it's for the sole purpose of math,
524,5,2,00:41:15.995,00:41:18.400,00:00:02.405,yeah yeah mom definitely,
525,5,2,00:41:18.599,00:41:19.158,00:00:00.559,look at those,
526,5,2,00:41:19.158,00:41:20.325,00:00:01.167,,okay yeah
527,5,2,00:41:20.405,00:41:24.366,00:00:03.961,,my mom was like Charlie you get paid let's do it
528,5,2,00:41:24.366,00:41:26.372,00:00:02.006,,because I was in debt to my parents
529,5,2,00:41:26.372,00:41:28.217,00:00:01.845,,and I do not want to pay them eighty dollars
530,5,2,00:41:28.217,00:41:31.799,00:00:03.582,how come you always debt to your parents,
531,5,2,00:41:32.867,00:41:33.994,00:00:01.127,,you're on eBay
532,5,2,00:41:33.994,00:41:37.686,00:00:03.692,,and you use too much money just to get one thing
533,5,2,00:41:38.275,00:41:39.103,00:00:00.828,,so now (inaudible) that
534,5,2,00:41:39.103,00:41:39.791,00:00:00.688,pause filler what did you get,
535,5,2,00:41:39.791,00:41:43.173,00:00:03.382,,pause filler I bought a PS Vita and a couple of games
536,5,2,00:41:43.173,00:41:43.233,00:00:00.060,oh oh,
537,5,2,00:41:43.343,00:41:47.234,00:00:03.891,I'm not sure,
538,5,2,00:41:50.906,00:41:55.476,00:00:04.570,ah so I get who the kind of person you are now,
539,5,2,00:41:57.261,00:41:58.588,00:00:01.327,so that's pretty good,
540,5,2,00:41:58.768,00:42:01.262,00:00:02.494,so I'm just going to finish the rest of this problem,
541,5,2,00:42:01.402,00:42:06.441,00:00:05.039,and I'm just going to talk and make sure I kind of get it right all right,
542,5,2,00:42:07.029,00:42:07.418,00:00:00.389,,all right
543,5,2,00:42:08.017,00:42:12.617,00:00:04.600,so basically there's this one kid in our class,
544,5,2,00:42:12.766,00:42:17.495,00:00:04.729,and he is easily the most annoying kid ever,
545,5,2,00:42:17.495,00:42:19.561,00:00:02.066,so basically his name is Daniel,
546,5,2,00:42:21.107,00:42:23.212,00:00:02.105,and he's sort of my friend,
547,5,2,00:42:23.212,00:42:24.250,00:00:01.038,but he's really not,
548,5,2,00:42:24.400,00:42:32.322,00:00:07.922,and basically yeah I'm the kid who could be making friends with pretty much anyone,
549,5,2,00:42:32.322,00:42:35.594,00:00:03.272,so I'm also that kid so pause filler,
550,5,2,00:42:38.657,00:42:43.596,00:00:04.939,you know like the weird like Dang Daniel meme that was came around,
551,5,2,00:42:44.145,00:42:44.604,00:00:00.459,,yeah
552,5,2,00:42:47.138,00:42:51.119,00:00:03.981,pause filler well since I'm in not any fan base,
553,5,2,00:42:51.119,00:42:54.791,00:00:03.672,and I have logical reasoning to know that that meme is awful pause filler,
554,5,2,00:42:55.270,00:43:01.396,00:00:06.126,basically pause filler he's always talking about like,
555,5,2,00:43:01.515,00:43:04.329,00:00:02.814,why do people say Dang Daniel all the time to me,
556,5,2,00:43:04.329,00:43:08.473,00:00:04.144,I'm like Daniel I don't think you understand ,
557,5,2,00:43:08.507,00:43:20.236,00:00:11.729,pause filler how one kid who just talked about a kid's white shoes just pause filler who create a meme somehow,
558,5,2,00:43:22.867,00:43:24.663,00:00:01.796,and now like everyone says it,
559,5,2,00:43:24.663,00:43:27.905,00:00:03.242,and it's getting really really really annoying,
560,5,2,00:43:28.045,00:43:29.163,00:00:01.118,like you don't even know,
561,5,2,00:43:29.881,00:43:36.007,00:00:06.126,,people call me Chewbaka because I have a low voice and something else
562,5,2,00:43:37.813,00:43:39.010,00:00:01.197,skin skin,
563,5,2,00:43:39.329,00:43:43.001,00:00:03.672,,yeah who's saying my best friends though
564,5,2,00:43:43.001,00:43:52.959,00:00:09.958,,so I don't punch him on the face or anything
565,5,2,00:43:49.403,00:43:53.149,00:00:03.746,yeah pause filler either they call me JJ,
566,5,2,00:43:55.149,00:44:01.329,00:00:06.180,or they call me pause filler Giordoni my pause filler Latin name,
567,5,2,00:44:02.686,00:44:03.405,00:00:00.719,,Giordani
568,5,2,00:44:03.734,00:44:04.283,00:00:00.549,yeah,
569,5,2,00:44:05.550,00:44:06.887,00:00:01.337,,that's actually pretty cool
570,5,2,00:44:07.126,00:44:07.705,00:00:00.579,I know,
571,5,2,00:44:08.563,00:44:09.980,00:00:01.417,,my name's British
572,5,2,00:44:10.568,00:44:12.384,00:00:01.816,,so it's called Charles
573,5,2,00:44:12.504,00:44:15.727,00:00:03.223,Charles Charles (inaudible),
574,5,2,00:44:16.585,00:44:18.241,00:00:01.656,oh I have Skittles in my mouth,
575,5,2,00:44:18.241,00:44:19.588,00:00:01.347,so I can't do any accent,
576,5,2,00:44:21.297,00:44:22.262,00:00:00.965,so that kind of sucks,
577,5,2,00:44:22.262,00:44:25.185,00:00:02.923,all right so this is what I got,
578,5,2,00:44:25.704,00:44:27.091,00:00:01.387,oh wow nice,
579,5,2,00:44:27.909,00:44:29.066,00:00:01.157,,yeah I was second
580,5,2,00:44:29.066,00:44:30.573,00:00:01.507,,and I was like yeah
581,5,2,00:44:30.573,00:44:33.347,00:00:02.774,,to me like I'm giving it ninety-five percent correct
582,5,2,00:44:33.776,00:44:35.721,00:00:01.945,,but I don't really think there's any other problem with it
583,5,2,00:44:39.104,00:44:39.593,00:00:00.489,,all right
584,5,2,00:44:39.682,00:44:40.660,00:00:00.978,all right,
585,5,2,00:44:41.837,00:44:43.464,00:00:01.627,,so yeah this is the same one you did (inaudible)
586,5,2,00:44:43.853,00:44:47.884,00:00:04.031,,you're going to get negative fifty-four by adding and going to subtract it
587,5,2,00:44:47.884,00:44:51.116,00:00:03.232,,because you don't want to have an extra number there that you don't need
588,5,2,00:44:54.341,00:44:56.205,00:00:01.864,all right fifty-four,
589,5,2,00:45:00.834,00:45:00.924,00:00:00.090,,(sfx) oh
590,5,2,00:45:00.934,00:45:05.124,00:00:04.190,uh-oh this is the part where you start hiccupping,
591,5,2,00:45:05.124,00:45:05.444,00:00:00.320,,yeah
592,5,2,00:45:05.504,00:45:11.660,00:00:06.156,well good thing I didn't eat mine as fast as you did,
593,5,2,00:45:12.348,00:45:12.717,00:00:00.369,,yeah
594,5,2,00:45:13.895,00:45:14.862,00:00:00.967,this is my last one,
595,5,2,00:45:16.828,00:45:19.103,00:00:02.275,,I have like five left
596,5,2,00:45:22.266,00:45:22.804,00:00:00.538,(laughter) beautiful,
597,5,2,00:45:22.804,00:45:34.150,00:00:11.346,all right now that isn't right pause filler,
598,5,2,00:45:37.590,00:45:38.658,00:00:01.068,,okay I'm going to help you out here
599,5,2,00:45:38.658,00:45:42.569,00:00:03.911,,so with the four x you have here
600,5,2,00:45:42.749,00:45:43.926,00:00:01.177,,what you're actually going to do is
601,5,2,00:45:43.926,00:45:51.310,00:00:07.384,,you're going to multiply this problem by one over k
602,5,2,00:45:53.637,00:45:59.361,00:00:05.724,,and as you do that this actually nope hang on I messed up real quick (laughter)
603,5,2,00:45:59.361,00:46:06.405,00:00:07.044,,(inaudible) let me real quick so I don't forget where I'm at
604,5,2,00:46:06.485,00:46:10.596,00:00:04.111,,all right you're also going to you forgot to add to the k here
605,5,2,00:46:11.374,00:46:13.419,00:00:02.045,,to actually do that I would like to first start
606,5,2,00:46:13.878,00:46:15.335,00:00:01.457,,this actually cancels it out
607,5,2,00:46:15.335,00:46:21.710,00:00:06.375,,and then you would have four equals sixty-two k
608,5,2,00:46:21.710,00:46:24.913,00:00:03.203,,now you have to simplify it from there
609,5,2,00:46:24.913,00:46:26.100,00:00:01.187,,and I'm going to let you do that
610,5,2,00:46:26.100,00:46:26.729,00:00:00.629,all right,
611,5,2,00:46:31.329,00:46:39.031,00:00:07.702,,yeah honestly having someone around your age teach you math helps out so much better than someone who's a lot older than you
612,5,2,00:46:39.939,00:46:42.793,00:00:02.854,oh yeah because you know it's a kid,
613,5,2,00:46:42.793,00:46:43.920,00:00:01.127,it's not like a,
614,5,2,00:46:44.479,00:46:47.033,00:00:02.554,,an adult who knows what you're talking about
615,5,2,00:46:48.100,00:46:49.936,00:00:01.836,oh oh my gosh,
616,5,2,00:46:50.056,00:46:50.964,00:00:00.908,I think I found,
617,5,2,00:46:52.800,00:46:54.107,00:00:01.307,oh my gosh,
618,5,2,00:46:54.596,00:46:55.134,00:00:00.538,,what
619,5,2,00:46:56.272,00:46:58.158,00:00:01.886,I found the way to use the calculator,
620,5,2,00:46:58.996,00:46:59.554,00:00:00.558,,really
621,5,2,00:46:59.844,00:47:00.293,00:00:00.449,yeah,
622,5,2,00:47:03.934,00:47:05.880,00:00:01.946,,I actually think that they're recording this
623,5,2,00:47:05.880,00:47:08.823,00:00:02.943,,because they put out mic for recording things when
624,5,2,00:47:08.823,00:47:11.298,00:00:02.475,all right I pulled up the calculator,
625,5,2,00:47:11.298,00:47:11.936,00:00:00.638,let's go,
626,5,2,00:47:11.936,00:47:14.341,00:00:02.405,all right so,
627,5,2,00:47:14.570,00:47:15.997,00:00:01.427,,is that hard for you to figure out
628,5,2,00:47:15.997,00:47:19.539,00:00:03.542,,it's only eighteen it's eighteen
629,5,2,00:47:19.539,00:47:26.663,00:00:07.124,no it's actually point zero six four is five one one six one two nine zero three two two five eight one,
630,5,2,00:47:28.519,00:47:28.788,00:00:00.269,,what
631,5,2,00:47:29.476,00:47:31.133,00:00:01.657,that's actually what it is,
632,5,2,00:47:31.133,00:47:32.440,00:00:01.307,that's what says on my calculator,
633,5,2,00:47:33.258,00:47:33.737,00:00:00.479,,oh wow
634,5,2,00:47:34.525,00:47:35.882,00:00:01.357,,well I'm thinking eighteen here
635,5,2,00:47:35.882,00:47:38.197,00:00:02.315,,because I don't have any decimal things or none before
636,5,2,00:47:38.197,00:47:40.581,00:00:02.384,okay it's eighteen k equals eighteen,
637,5,2,00:47:40.581,00:47:41.609,00:00:01.028,all right we did it yay ops,
638,5,2,00:47:41.609,00:47:43.794,00:00:02.185,,oh there we go
639,5,2,00:47:43.894,00:47:57.253,00:00:13.359,,now this one pause filler I'm going to give you a little pause filler sneak peak here in order to get this out pretty fast
640,5,2,00:47:57.253,00:48:01.025,00:00:03.772,,you're going to multiply each sides by y
641,5,2,00:48:01.025,00:48:02.851,00:00:01.826,,so this y cancels out y
642,5,2,00:48:02.851,00:48:09.795,00:00:06.944,,and you actually are going to add a y what y
643,5,2,00:48:10.902,00:48:11.114,00:00:00.212,there,
644,5,2,00:48:11.114,00:48:12.133,00:00:01.019,no no,
645,5,2,00:48:13.391,00:48:16.240,00:00:02.849,,yeah and then we're going to add y to the two ten
646,5,2,00:48:17.487,00:48:20.241,00:00:02.754,,so yeah wait yeah
647,5,2,00:48:20.241,00:48:24.412,00:00:04.171,,so then you basically know what pause filler you get there
648,5,2,00:48:25.349,00:48:28.293,00:00:02.944,,and then all you need to do is just simplify the answer
649,5,2,00:48:33.591,00:48:33.990,00:00:00.399,,oh okay
650,5,2,00:48:36.075,00:48:36.923,00:00:00.848,I'm just using the highlighter,
651,5,2,00:48:37.113,00:48:39.856,00:00:02.743,all right so wait,
652,5,2,00:48:39.916,00:48:40.465,00:00:00.549,hold on,
653,5,2,00:48:42.850,00:48:49.475,00:00:06.625,no I don't want to go in Scribblar,
654,5,2,00:48:47.000,00:48:47.261,00:00:00.261,,(laughter)
655,5,2,00:48:49.794,00:48:53.915,00:00:04.121,all right please undo,
656,5,2,00:48:57.317,00:49:02.385,00:00:05.068,no apparently this is another glitch where it won't erase this,
657,5,2,00:49:02.385,00:49:03.533,00:00:01.148,so I'm just going to do that,
658,5,2,00:49:03.533,00:49:09.170,00:00:05.637,all right all right so I think what you're missing here is that,
659,5,2,00:49:09.509,00:49:13.520,00:00:04.011,we have to put the y here and the negative fourteen there,
660,5,2,00:49:14.598,00:49:16.753,00:00:02.155,,well actually if you would do that
661,5,2,00:49:17.371,00:49:19.736,00:00:02.365,,you would have fourteen y
662,5,2,00:49:19.826,00:49:22.719,00:00:02.893,,but negative fourteen y was negative fourteen y
663,5,2,00:49:23.627,00:49:24.695,00:00:01.068,oh,
664,5,2,00:49:25.533,00:49:27.837,00:00:02.304,,so if you were actually to multiply the ys here
665,5,2,00:49:29.613,00:49:33.066,00:00:03.453,,they would cancel out for some reason I do not know the whereabouts of
666,5,2,00:49:34.442,00:49:36.787,00:00:02.345,,and you just multiply it here
667,5,2,00:49:36.787,00:49:37.446,00:00:00.659,,and you get y
668,5,2,00:49:37.446,00:49:39.840,00:00:02.394,all righty then pause filler,
669,5,2,00:49:40.968,00:49:44.410,00:00:03.442,,only if it works
670,5,2,00:49:44.520,00:49:47.253,00:00:02.733,,only if this explain to me why what happened
671,5,2,00:49:47.742,00:49:51.035,00:00:03.293,,I would understand it better
672,5,2,00:49:51.184,00:49:53.040,00:00:01.856,pause filler well these are college students,
673,5,2,00:49:53.040,00:49:55.854,00:00:02.814,and they just rigged this up just for us,
674,5,2,00:49:56.093,00:49:57.231,00:00:01.138,,yay
675,5,2,00:49:57.231,00:50:00.773,00:00:03.542,all right and then we put y here right,
676,5,2,00:50:01.062,00:50:01.461,00:00:00.399,,yeah
677,5,2,00:50:02.509,00:50:05.791,00:00:03.282,all right and then I do that's a perfect one,
678,5,2,00:50:06.769,00:50:10.201,00:00:03.432,,yeah that actually is that's a pretty decent line
679,5,2,00:50:10.201,00:50:12.905,00:00:02.704,,I don't see any curves or anything
680,5,2,00:50:16.617,00:50:22.184,00:00:05.567,and then what you do here is negative fourteen negative fourteen,
681,5,2,00:50:23.541,00:50:28.290,00:00:04.749,calculator calculator,
682,5,2,00:50:28.569,00:50:31.094,00:00:02.525,,honestly I don't even know the answer to this
683,5,2,00:50:31.243,00:50:35.424,00:00:04.181,,but I do have a sort of answer to it
684,5,2,00:50:36.671,00:50:41.720,00:00:05.049,all right so it's two ten divided by four two,
685,5,2,00:50:43.186,00:50:43.924,00:00:00.738,,negative fourteen
686,5,2,00:50:43.924,00:50:46.658,00:00:02.734,so I got fifteen negative fifteen,
687,5,2,00:50:46.938,00:50:49.532,00:00:02.594,,yeah so you have negative fifteen equals y yeah
688,5,2,00:50:52.764,00:50:54.041,00:00:01.277,oh yeah look at that,
689,5,2,00:50:54.421,00:50:57.304,00:00:02.883,oh yeah oh (sfx),
690,5,2,00:50:59.749,00:51:01.115,00:00:01.366,,okay
691,5,2,00:51:01.175,00:51:03.121,00:00:01.946,all right all right,
692,5,2,00:51:03.121,00:51:07.042,00:00:03.921,I have another basic understanding of what I'm supposed to do here,
693,5,2,00:51:07.042,00:51:08.718,00:00:01.676,so I'm just going to talk while I work,
694,5,2,00:51:09.157,00:51:12.510,00:00:03.353,all right so this goes off like,
695,5,2,00:51:12.510,00:51:15.493,00:00:02.983,these easy problems are giving us more opportunities to talk,
696,5,2,00:51:15.533,00:51:15.902,00:00:00.369,thanks CMU,
697,5,2,00:51:15.902,00:51:16.920,00:00:01.018,you know all right,
698,5,2,00:51:16.920,00:51:17.079,00:00:00.159,,yeah
699,5,2,00:51:17.079,00:51:18.396,00:00:01.317,all right yeah,
700,5,2,00:51:18.636,00:51:21.010,00:00:02.374,,you make confusing equipment but easy math problems
701,5,2,00:51:21.010,00:51:26.697,00:00:05.687,yeah like you have like robots in the room next to me,
702,5,2,00:51:26.697,00:51:29.581,00:00:02.884,but in the next room you're teaching a kid how to do math,
703,5,2,00:51:30.409,00:51:30.878,00:00:00.469,,yeah
704,5,2,00:51:30.908,00:51:35.178,00:00:04.270,oh this is wrong,
705,5,2,00:51:37.363,00:51:39.887,00:00:02.524,,yeah I was starting to wonder what was going on there
706,5,2,00:51:40.000,00:51:43.000,00:00:03.000,yeah (inaudible) pause filler,
707,5,2,00:51:40.017,00:51:46.063,00:00:06.046,,so the next five up there right
708,5,2,00:51:47.410,00:51:48.049,00:00:00.639,pause filler yeah,
709,5,2,00:51:48.777,00:51:51.331,00:00:02.554,,so here's one thing I notice you're getting confused at
710,5,2,00:51:51.331,00:51:53.636,00:00:02.305,,what you want to do is that
711,5,2,00:51:53.636,00:51:55.622,00:00:01.986,,you're doing the five
712,5,2,00:51:57.238,00:51:59.104,00:00:01.866,,you want to do this but
713,5,2,00:51:59.104,00:52:04.042,00:00:04.938,,and it's hard because for you
714,5,2,00:52:04.042,00:52:05.300,00:00:01.258,,you're not finding any numbers
715,5,2,00:52:05.679,00:52:07.445,00:00:01.766,,but if you were actually to do this that
716,5,2,00:52:07.445,00:52:08.782,00:00:01.337,,so it must be x isn't it
717,5,2,00:52:09.650,00:52:10.637,00:00:00.987,,I don't know why I put it
718,5,2,00:52:10.637,00:52:11.236,00:00:00.599,that's anx,
719,5,2,00:52:12.443,00:52:18.090,00:00:05.647,,yeah so if you were to actually put the problem like this
720,5,2,00:52:18.090,00:52:22.041,00:00:03.951,,you would still put a five over what five over x
721,5,2,00:52:22.181,00:52:23.648,00:00:01.467,,then the x would care about
722,5,2,00:52:23.648,00:52:27.838,00:00:04.190,,so it would just be one hundred thirty-seven x equals five
723,5,2,00:52:27.838,00:52:31.819,00:00:03.981,,and then it be a lot simpler for you to simplify it
724,5,2,00:52:31.989,00:52:36.588,00:00:04.599,,so with that I think if you were to start pause filler the space the problems like that
725,5,2,00:52:36.588,00:52:38.484,00:00:01.896,,you'll be able to get passed them pretty fast
726,5,2,00:52:40.100,00:52:49.830,00:00:09.730,all right so pause filler it just be times x right,
727,5,2,00:52:49.519,00:52:51.814,00:00:02.295,,yeah so one over x
728,5,2,00:52:51.814,00:52:53.041,00:00:01.227,,or x times x
729,5,2,00:52:53.360,00:52:55.984,00:00:02.624,,it doesn't matter whichever way of those you put it
730,5,2,00:52:59.716,00:53:00.155,00:00:00.439,right,
731,5,2,00:53:00.704,00:53:03.467,00:00:02.763,,yeah so that's also correct
732,5,2,00:53:03.936,00:53:10.501,00:00:06.565,,and your outcome is for this part here
733,5,2,00:53:11.868,00:53:16.877,00:00:05.009,,so it's one thirty-seven x equals five yeah
734,5,2,00:53:16.877,00:53:23.891,00:00:07.014,all right pause filler,
735,5,2,00:53:24.390,00:53:26.932,00:00:02.542,one hundred and thirty-seven ,
736,5,2,00:53:28.494,00:53:36.792,00:00:08.298,pause filler equals oh god my brain is like melting now,
737,5,2,00:53:37.231,00:53:40.753,00:00:03.522,,yeah okay I can just see how tired you are
738,5,2,00:53:41.830,00:53:41.970,00:00:00.140,oh,
739,5,2,00:53:41.970,00:53:55.479,00:00:13.509,all right and then five,
740,5,2,00:53:55.479,00:54:00.208,00:00:04.729,yeah yeah (laughter),
741,5,2,00:54:00.208,00:54:02.413,00:00:02.205,,also you might forgot a little something there
742,5,2,00:54:03.341,00:54:03.860,00:00:00.519,what,
743,5,2,00:54:04.738,00:54:06.324,00:00:01.586,oh yeah there's an x there,
744,5,2,00:54:06.324,00:54:07.282,00:00:00.958,yeah yeah yeah,
745,5,2,00:54:08.100,00:54:08.180,00:00:00.080,,yeah
746,5,2,00:54:08.450,00:54:09.587,00:00:01.137,,so yeah
747,5,2,00:54:09.587,00:54:12.211,00:00:02.624,,then once you get all this you just got to simplify it
748,5,2,00:54:12.211,00:54:14.815,00:00:02.604,,and then the whole thing becomes very very easy
749,5,2,00:54:17.130,00:54:19.275,00:00:02.145,calculator calculator,
750,5,2,00:54:20.313,00:54:21.680,00:00:01.367,,I got to go fast
751,5,2,00:54:23.196,00:54:23.735,00:00:00.539,,I can't do it
752,5,2,00:54:30.998,00:54:31.966,00:00:00.968,,twenty-seven
753,5,2,00:54:32.335,00:54:34.640,00:00:02.305,no I don't want to search the web for calculator,
754,5,2,00:54:34.640,00:54:36.386,00:00:01.746,or Bing could work,
755,5,2,00:54:36.386,00:54:37.015,00:00:00.629,that's fine,
756,5,2,00:54:40.417,00:54:46.334,00:00:05.917,one hundred and thirty-seven divided by five equals twenty-seven point four,
757,5,2,00:54:46.334,00:54:47.142,00:00:00.808,thanks Bing,
758,5,2,00:54:49.377,00:54:50.434,00:00:01.057,,so that's
759,5,2,00:54:52.779,00:54:53.268,00:00:00.489,all right,
760,5,2,00:54:53.777,00:54:54.016,00:00:00.239,,yeah
761,5,2,00:54:55.163,00:54:55.493,00:00:00.330,yeah,
762,5,2,00:54:58.100,00:54:59.743,00:00:01.643,,and then onto problem six
763,5,2,00:55:00.432,00:55:00.771,00:00:00.339,,okay woah
764,5,2,00:55:01.010,00:55:12.324,00:00:11.314,,yup okay so I'm going to also help you out here
765,5,2,00:55:02.000,00:55:09.578,00:00:07.578,(sfx),
766,5,2,00:55:12.664,00:55:18.830,00:00:06.166,,all right you were going to just rid of the thirty-nine by adding thirty-nine
767,5,2,00:55:20.416,00:55:24.946,00:00:04.530,,and also you're going to add it oh wow you're already ahead of me
768,5,2,00:55:25.604,00:55:29.515,00:00:03.911,,so you get that outcome there and also going
769,5,2,00:55:35.103,00:55:35.861,00:00:00.758,nothing,
770,5,2,00:55:36.968,00:55:41.847,00:00:04.879,,yeah so then here you will have to subtract
771,5,2,00:55:43.174,00:55:44.232,00:00:01.058,,yeah subtract
772,5,2,00:55:46.666,00:55:48.612,00:00:01.946,,and so that's okay you subtract
773,5,2,00:55:49.091,00:55:53.182,00:00:04.091,,whereas I'm totally getting I'm confusing myself looking at two things at once
774,5,2,00:55:53.182,00:55:53.730,00:00:00.548,all right,
775,5,2,00:55:54.588,00:55:56.903,00:00:02.315,,you will subtract twelve x from each side
776,5,2,00:55:57.292,00:56:02.351,00:00:05.059,oh okay I get what we're doing here now,
777,5,2,00:56:03.089,00:56:03.718,00:00:00.629,so yeah,
778,5,2,00:56:04.007,00:56:06.461,00:00:02.454,,this just got a step higher from what were at before
779,5,2,00:56:08.108,00:56:09.245,00:00:01.137,yeah just a step,
780,5,2,00:56:10.911,00:56:12.238,00:00:01.327,I see what we're doing,
781,5,2,00:56:12.238,00:56:16.199,00:00:03.961,so that would be five x equals eighteen,
782,5,2,00:56:17.995,00:56:19.442,00:00:01.447,,all right so
783,5,2,00:56:19.522,00:56:21.707,00:00:02.185,and then you would do this right,
784,5,2,00:56:22.844,00:56:24.041,00:00:01.197,,yeah you would do that
785,5,2,00:56:27.000,00:56:27.754,00:00:00.754,okay pause filler,
786,5,2,00:56:32.653,00:56:33.660,00:00:01.007,,and then simplify
787,5,2,00:56:37.491,00:56:44.565,00:00:07.074,oh yeah not to mention the only thing I really like about Japanese cartoons is like the opening theme songs,
788,5,2,00:56:44.744,00:56:45.273,00:00:00.529,,I know
789,5,2,00:56:45.533,00:56:47.059,00:00:01.526,(laughter) they're catchy,
790,5,2,00:56:47.349,00:56:47.598,00:00:00.249,,I know
791,5,2,00:56:47.598,00:56:51.320,00:00:03.722,,sometimes that's the only thing I look forward to in the show
792,5,2,00:56:51.320,00:56:53.475,00:00:02.155,,just waiting for the theme song
793,5,2,00:56:53.704,00:56:56.358,00:00:02.654,yeah Attack on Titan has a really catchy one,
794,5,2,00:56:56.657,00:57:00.209,00:00:03.552,I had to be I mean I had to be honest like really,
795,5,2,00:57:01.097,00:57:05.717,00:00:04.620,,that was unexpected for a pretty violent show
796,5,2,00:57:05.876,00:57:10.905,00:00:05.029,yeah (sfx) it sounds like fricking like Naruto at first,
797,5,2,00:57:10.905,00:57:12.481,00:00:01.576,and then like you're just watching like,
798,5,2,00:57:12.481,00:57:14.158,00:00:01.677,what the frick is this,
799,5,2,00:57:14.207,00:57:15.315,00:00:01.108,,yeah and like
800,5,2,00:57:15.315,00:57:18.927,00:00:03.612,there's fricking giant naked people fighting each other for god's sakes,
801,5,2,00:57:19.156,00:57:23.975,00:00:04.819,,yeah and you're putting on like music you would hear but little kids
802,5,2,00:57:25.522,00:57:26.769,00:00:01.247,so weird,
803,5,2,00:57:27.148,00:57:29.323,00:00:02.175,,but it does work out very very well
804,5,2,00:57:29.323,00:57:31.209,00:00:01.886,I don't know how it just does,
805,5,2,00:57:31.269,00:57:34.621,00:00:03.352,I mean I've only watched like two episodes on Attack on Titan,
806,5,2,00:57:34.621,00:57:37.305,00:00:02.684,but that's really it (laughter),
807,5,2,00:57:37.305,00:57:40.258,00:00:02.953,and that's probably all I'm ever going to watch,
808,5,2,00:57:40.258,00:57:43.042,00:00:02.784,so I just never gotten into the anime,
809,5,2,00:57:43.142,00:57:44.080,00:00:00.938,it's just not my thing,
810,5,2,00:57:44.948,00:57:47.372,00:00:02.424,,yeah getting in anime is really hard
811,5,2,00:57:47.482,00:57:48.080,00:00:00.598,yeah,
812,5,2,00:57:48.080,00:57:50.754,00:00:02.674,,because you have to find like what you're interested in
813,5,2,00:57:50.754,00:57:53.049,00:00:02.295,,and then find what show you need to watch
814,5,2,00:57:53.169,00:57:54.855,00:00:01.686,well I've watched a lot,
815,5,2,00:57:54.855,00:57:57.379,00:00:02.524,and I've watched like every genre there is,
816,5,2,00:57:57.379,00:57:59.574,00:00:02.195,so I'm just not into it,
817,5,2,00:58:00.452,00:58:03.176,00:00:02.724,,yeah it's for something a lot of people like
818,5,2,00:58:03.176,00:58:05.980,00:00:02.804,,but it just doesn't catch on
819,5,2,00:58:06.838,00:58:11.477,00:00:04.639,yeah and also it gets me sick whenever I'm around watching,
820,5,2,00:58:11.477,00:58:15.169,00:00:03.692,like all right please tell me this is relatable to you,
821,5,2,00:58:15.448,00:58:19.669,00:00:04.221,whenever you're watching like a history video about like a country or something,
822,5,2,00:58:19.669,00:58:21.564,00:00:01.895,it's like oh like the weird like,
