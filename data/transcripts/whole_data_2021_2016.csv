9379,3,1,S1 ,okay,,03:43.0,03:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9380,3,1,S1 ,yeah pause filler so I guess we're supposed to work through these problems,,03:44.0,03:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9381,3,1,S1 ,not,,03:52.0,03:52.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9382,3,1,S1 ,,all right so just get rid of the scribbles I guess so that,03:52.0,03:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9383,3,1,S1 ,okay so pause filler,,03:58.0,04:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9384,3,1,S1 ,so like what I do is before I started erasing the problem,,04:03.0,04:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9385,3,1,S1 ,so I think I'm just going to have to rewrite that problem,,04:07.0,04:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9386,3,1,S1 ,and that did okay adjacent pencil,,04:11.0,04:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9387,3,1,S1 ,pause filler let's see three plus x equals twenty-two,,04:15.0,04:23.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9388,3,1,S1 ,,all right,04:23.0,04:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9389,3,1,S1 ,so I assume you probably know how to solve this one,,04:28.0,04:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9390,3,1,S1 ,,yes,04:34.0,04:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9391,3,1,S1 ,,pause filler sorry you're tutoring me first,04:34.0,04:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9392,3,1,S1 ,that's what I think they said,,04:36.0,04:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9393,3,1,S1 ,,okay,04:38.0,04:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9394,3,1,S1 ,so I guess pause filler you need to get x on leave only a thing on one side,,04:39.0,04:47.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9395,3,1,S1 ,so you're going to have to get rid of three,,04:47.0,04:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9396,3,1,S1 ,,yeah so would you have to subtract three from both sides,04:49.0,04:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9397,3,1,S1 ,pause filler yeah,,04:53.0,04:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9398,3,1,S1 ,so can you do it on there,,04:54.0,04:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9399,3,1,S1 ,,yeah,04:56.0,04:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9400,3,1,S1 ,,do you see,04:57.0,04:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9401,3,1,S1 ,yup,,04:58.0,04:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9402,3,1,S1 ,,and then this cancels out,04:58.0,05:05.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9403,3,1,S1 ,,so then you're just left with x equals,05:06.0,05:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9404,3,1,S1 ,,huh,05:15.0,05:15.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9405,3,1,S1 ,,oh okay,05:16.0,05:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

9407,3,1,S1 ,,all right great,05:18.0,05:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9408,3,1,S1 ,,all right so we had to go on a different page,05:26.0,05:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9409,3,1,S1 ,,we went on this page with this equals x,05:29.0,05:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9410,3,1,S1 ,,uh-huh,05:33.0,05:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

9445,3,1,T1 ,,,07:37.0,08:22.0,00:45.0,,,,,,
9446,3,1,T1 ,okay so pause filler as we're doing equal,,07:37.0,07:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9447,3,1,T1 ,so I wonder if I can circle all right here,,07:38.0,07:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,

9456,3,1,T1 ,,so pause filler you add six,08:05.0,08:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9457,3,1,T1 ,,and then you get x equals nineteen,08:07.0,08:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9458,3,1,T1 ,,oh gosh,08:10.0,08:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9459,3,1,T1 ,so okay pause filler,,08:11.0,08:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

9464,3,1,T1 ,oh (laughter) okay,,08:27.0,08:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9465,3,1,T1 ,pause filler okay for this one it's sort of the same thing,,08:27.0,08:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9466,3,1,T1 ,,,08:30.0,09:11.0,00:41.0,,,,,,
9467,3,1,T1 ,so you want to get pause filler or does the eight,,08:30.0,08:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9468,3,1,T1 ,,yeah and that's a negative so you would have to add it,08:35.0,08:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9469,3,1,T1 ,yeah just like the last one,,08:40.0,08:54.0,00:14.0,,,,,,

9471,3,1,T1 ,okay,,08:59.0,08:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9472,3,1,T1 ,that was it not bad,,08:59.0,09:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9473,3,1,T1 ,,fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two,09:00.0,09:13.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
9474,3,1,T1 ,,all right next page right,09:14.0,09:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9475,3,1,T1 ,yup,,09:17.0,09:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9476,3,1,T1 ,,,09:17.0,09:49.0,00:32.0,,,,,,
9477,3,1,T1 ,there we go (laughter),,09:17.0,09:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9478,3,1,T1 ,okay pause filler so this one is a lot like the other ones,,09:18.0,09:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9479,3,1,T1 ,except for this one yeah you don't want to add it,,09:21.0,09:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9480,3,1,T1 ,,yeah so you have to subtract,09:24.0,09:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9481,3,1,T1 ,,so you would subtract eleven because it's a positive right,09:27.0,09:33.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9482,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,09:33.0,09:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9483,3,1,T1 ,,all right so minus eleven,09:34.0,09:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9484,3,1,T1 ,,then those who cancel out,09:43.0,09:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9485,3,1,T1 ,,so it would be k equals six,09:45.0,09:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9486,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,09:47.0,09:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9487,3,1,T1 ,,oh gosh,09:49.0,09:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9488,3,1,T1 ,,this is so messy,09:49.0,09:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9489,3,1,T1 ,,oh,09:51.0,09:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9490,3,1,T1 ,okay so this time we pause filler yeah only one term on the other side so yeah,,09:51.0,10:01.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
9491,3,1,T1 ,,,09:58.0,11:57.0,01:59.0,,,,,,
9492,3,1,T1 ,pause filler so you want to get rid of the forty-four,,10:01.0,10:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9493,3,1,T1 ,so the coefficient of x is one so,,10:04.0,10:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9494,3,1,T1 ,,yeah pause filler so you want to get rid of the forty-four so the coefficient of x is one so,10:07.0,10:13.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9495,3,1,T1 ,,yeah,10:13.0,10:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9496,3,1,T1 ,do you know how to do that,,10:15.0,10:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9497,3,1,T1 ,,yeah yeah yeah yeah,10:17.0,10:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9498,3,1,T1 ,,so you'd have to divide because it's multiplication,10:18.0,10:22.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9499,3,1,T1 ,,then you do the opposites,10:22.0,10:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9500,3,1,T1 ,,so divided by forty,10:23.0,10:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9501,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,10:24.0,10:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9502,3,1,T1 ,,it's so weird,10:26.0,10:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9503,3,1,T1 ,,because I have to like I have to take a moment to think now,10:27.0,10:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9504,3,1,T1 ,,because I'm so accustomed in my class to using calculators like she lets s,10:31.0,10:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9505,3,1,T1 ,I know yeah,,10:35.0,10:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9506,3,1,T1 ,,so divide it,10:37.0,10:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9507,3,1,T1 ,on personal calculators and I just pull it up,,10:38.0,10:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9508,3,1,T1 ,,yeah wait oh gosh,10:41.0,10:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9509,3,1,T1 ,,is this what even is this then (laughter),10:44.0,10:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9510,3,1,T1 ,,ten x equals twenty-two divided two hundred and twenty divided by forty-four,10:54.0,11:03.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9511,3,1,T1 ,yeah I wonder if I could,,11:05.0,11:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9512,3,1,T1 ,pause filler so that's like a forty-four on that side,,11:08.0,11:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9513,3,1,T1 ,that was lovely,,11:10.0,11:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9514,3,1,T1 ,okay I know what I mean,,11:11.0,11:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9515,3,1,T1 ,and two hundred twenty,,11:13.0,11:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9516,3,1,T1 ,see you can go I see like pause filler,,11:15.0,11:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9517,3,1,T1 ,,yeah yeah yeah yeah,11:20.0,11:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9518,3,1,T1 ,I just yeah okay how many times,,11:20.0,11:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9519,3,1,T1 ,it's like about five five ten,,11:23.0,11:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9520,3,1,T1 ,,oh yeah that would make sense so,11:27.0,11:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9521,3,1,T1 ,and maybe it's (inaudible) five,,11:29.0,11:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9522,3,1,T1 ,,yeah it,11:31.0,11:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9523,3,1,T1 ,(inaudible) that was not how it's supposed to,,11:36.0,11:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9524,3,1,T1 ,,it seems so embarrassing because it's just like we're so used to using calculators,11:39.0,11:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9525,3,1,T1 ,,but it just yeah,11:42.0,11:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9526,3,1,T1 ,okay let's see,,11:45.0,11:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9527,3,1,T1 ,that's zero,,11:46.0,11:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9528,3,1,T1 ,it's pause filler a two yeah a two,,11:48.0,11:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9529,3,1,T1 ,four times that that's also,,11:52.0,11:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9530,3,1,T1 ,yeah it's five,,11:54.0,11:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9531,3,1,T1 ,,all right great,11:56.0,11:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9532,3,1,T1 ,,so are you an advanced then,12:00.0,12:01.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
9533,3,1,T1 ,,because you're an algebra in the seventh grade,12:02.0,12:04.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
9534,3,1,T1 ,pause filler yes,,12:05.0,12:06.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
9535,3,1,T1 ,so what I'm doing at the moment I'm taking a full year of algebra one,,12:06.0,12:10.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
9536,3,1,T1 ,but at the same time I'm also taking geometry,,12:10.0,12:12.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
9537,3,1,T1 ,,oh god,12:12.0,12:13.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
9538,3,1,T1 ,yeah so,,12:13.0,12:14.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
9539,3,1,T1 ,,like I pause filler I'm not in like there's like three levels of math,12:14.0,12:19.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
9540,3,1,T1 ,,there's like the low math (inaudible) who don't like get as quickly,12:19.0,12:23.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
9541,3,1,T1 ,,just like the regular math,12:23.0,12:24.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
9542,3,1,T1 ,,and then there's the pause filler advanced math,12:24.0,12:26.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
9543,3,1,T1 ,,I'm in just like the regular math,12:26.0,12:28.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
9544,3,1,T1 ,,and I'm like right where I should be in my grade,12:28.0,12:31.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
9545,3,1,T1 ,,and English is more my subject,12:31.0,12:33.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
9546,3,1,T1 ,,like I'm in advanced English all the time,12:33.0,12:35.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
9547,3,1,T1 ,,but math it's all right I just,12:35.0,12:39.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
9548,3,1,T1 ,yeah so,,12:40.0,12:40.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
9549,3,1,T1 ,,,12:40.0,13:39.0,00:59.0,,,,,,
9550,3,1,T1 ,,all right so now you add nine right,12:40.0,12:47.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9551,3,1,T1 ,yeah so (inaudible),,12:47.0,12:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9552,3,1,T1 ,,so you add nine to this,12:48.0,12:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9553,3,1,T1 ,,and then you're left with thirteen p equals fifty,12:52.0,13:00.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9554,3,1,T1 ,,so,13:01.0,13:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9555,3,1,T1 ,pause filler so then you want to give it to the thirteen,,13:03.0,13:09.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9556,3,1,T1 ,,so you divide it by thirteen,13:09.0,13:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9557,3,1,T1 ,,wait does the fraction pause filler,13:14.0,13:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9558,3,1,T1 ,,does the fifty divided by thirteen equal out to a fraction,13:19.0,13:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9559,3,1,T1 ,no I don't think it's simplified,,13:23.0,13:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9560,3,1,T1 ,I think it's just fifty over thirteen,,13:24.0,13:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9561,3,1,T1 ,,all right great,13:26.0,13:27.0,00:01.0,,,0,,,
9562,3,1,T1 ,,I thought that it could've been a simplified fraction,13:30.0,13:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9563,3,1,T1 ,,I'm not sure,13:33.0,13:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9564,3,1,T1 ,I mean like thirteen is like prawn numbers,,13:34.0,13:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9565,3,1,T1 ,so it would not be that likely,,13:36.0,13:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9566,3,1,T1 ,,,13:39.0,14:19.0,00:40.0,,,,,,
9567,3,1,T1 ,,yeah so with this one it's a little bit different,13:39.0,13:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9568,3,1,T1 ,,but you just subtract ten from both sides,13:42.0,13:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9569,3,1,T1 ,yup,,13:48.0,13:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9570,3,1,T1 ,,so twenty-four,13:49.0,13:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9571,3,1,T1 ,,and pause filler so you're left with six x equals twenty-four,13:54.0,14:01.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9572,3,1,T1 ,,so then you divide by (laughter),14:01.0,14:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9573,3,1,T1 ,,sorry I'm getting over a cold,14:02.0,14:05.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
9574,3,1,T1 ,,so that's why I sound,14:05.0,14:06.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
9575,3,1,T1 ,pause filler yeah a six,,14:06.0,14:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9576,3,1,T1 ,,divided by six,14:09.0,14:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9577,3,1,T1 ,,and then x equals four because twenty-four divided by six equals four,14:10.0,14:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9578,3,1,T1 ,yeah oh your equals signs are getting better,,14:14.0,14:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9579,3,1,T1 ,,yeah,14:18.0,14:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9580,3,1,T1 ,okay next one,,14:19.0,14:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9581,3,1,T1 ,,,14:21.0,15:28.0,01:07.0,,,,,,
9582,3,1,T1 ,,all right so,14:21.0,14:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9583,3,1,T1 ,,with this one since that's a negative you add it right so,14:27.0,14:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9584,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,14:32.0,14:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9585,3,1,T1 ,,oh okay,14:41.0,14:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9586,3,1,T1 ,,oh my gosh,14:45.0,14:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9587,3,1,T1 ,,so that would equal,14:46.0,14:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9588,3,1,T1 ,,sixty-two equals fifteen k,14:54.0,14:59.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9589,3,1,T1 ,,oh my god,14:59.0,15:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9590,3,1,T1 ,,pause filler and then divide that by fifteen,15:01.0,15:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9591,3,1,T1 ,,so that would just be another,15:08.0,15:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9592,3,1,T1 ,let's see,,15:10.0,15:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9593,3,1,T1 ,where were we sixty-two (inaudible),,15:11.0,15:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9594,3,1,T1 ,nope,,15:12.0,15:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9595,3,1,T1 ,I'd say that no you can't simplify,,15:13.0,15:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9596,3,1,T1 ,it maybe maybe not,,15:18.0,15:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9597,3,1,T1 ,yeah because yeah,,15:26.0,15:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9598,3,1,T1 ,,all right,15:27.0,15:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9599,3,1,T1 ,,,15:29.0,16:36.0,01:07.0,,,,,,
9600,3,1,T1 ,,so for this one,15:30.0,15:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9601,3,1,T1 ,,subtract,15:36.0,15:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9602,3,1,T1 ,twelve,,15:38.0,15:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9603,3,1,T1 ,,sorry it's like it takes a minute for it to show up,15:42.0,15:52.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
9604,3,1,T1 ,yeah real slow okay,,15:53.0,15:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9605,3,1,T1 ,so yeah twenty-one,,15:57.0,16:10.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
9606,3,1,T1 ,that's right,,16:10.0,16:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9607,3,1,T1 ,,so then that cancels out obviously,16:11.0,16:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9608,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,16:14.0,16:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9609,3,1,T1 ,,so plus,16:15.0,16:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9610,3,1,T1 ,,oh no that equals,16:16.0,16:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9611,3,1,T1 ,,twenty-one equals seven x,16:19.0,16:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9612,3,1,T1 ,,and then twenty-one is divisible by sevens,16:23.0,16:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9613,3,1,T1 ,,so that's pause filler divisible by three,16:25.0,16:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9614,3,1,T1 ,,so then pause filler x equals three,16:29.0,16:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9615,3,1,T1 ,yup okay,,16:34.0,16:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9616,3,1,T1 ,,all right great,16:37.0,16:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9617,3,1,T1 ,,oh,16:39.0,16:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9618,3,1,T1 ,,,16:39.0,17:38.0,00:59.0,,,,,,
9619,3,1,T1 ,,so this is a different one,16:39.0,16:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9620,3,1,T1 ,,so first you're going to get to pause filler you're going to do the variables first,16:42.0,16:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9621,3,1,T1 ,,and then you do the one that's like less right,16:47.0,16:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9622,3,1,T1 ,yeah you do the less,,16:50.0,16:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9623,3,1,T1 ,because otherwise you'll have the negative p,,16:51.0,16:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9624,3,1,T1 ,and that's not that fun,,16:53.0,16:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9625,3,1,T1 ,,yeah so minus p,16:54.0,16:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9626,3,1,T1 ,,and then minus p,16:57.0,16:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9627,3,1,T1 ,,so you end up with fifteen equals,16:59.0,17:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9628,3,1,T1 ,,oh gosh,17:02.0,17:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9629,3,1,T1 ,,got it,17:03.0,17:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9630,3,1,T1 ,,pause filler fifteen sorry pause filler fifteen equals two p plus twelve,17:06.0,17:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9631,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,17:13.0,17:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9632,3,1,T1 ,,so then pause filler,17:13.0,17:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9633,3,1,T1 ,it's just like the other problems,,17:14.0,17:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9634,3,1,T1 ,,yeah now you subtract twelve,17:16.0,17:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9635,3,1,T1 ,,so three equals,17:20.0,17:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9636,3,1,T1 ,,oh god,17:23.0,17:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9637,3,1,T1 ,,two p no,17:25.0,17:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9638,3,1,T1 ,,no you divide it by two,17:28.0,17:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9639,3,1,T1 ,,so you end up with three halves,17:30.0,17:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9640,3,1,T1 ,yeah so,,17:36.0,17:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9641,3,1,T1 ,because you can't simplify that anymore,,17:36.0,17:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9642,3,1,T1 ,,yeah all right,17:38.0,17:47.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9643,3,1,T1 ,,,17:47.0,19:36.0,01:49.0,,,,,,
9644,3,1,T1 ,okay so for this one yeah you want to start off by having only one k,,17:47.0,17:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9645,3,1,T1 ,,so you have to subtract that anyway,17:57.0,18:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9646,3,1,T1 ,,subtract that from this,18:01.0,18:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9647,3,1,T1 ,,so you would end up with negative ten,18:05.0,18:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9648,3,1,T1 ,,because you leave the negative there equals,18:07.0,18:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9649,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,18:09.0,18:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9650,3,1,T1 ,,seven k minus sixty-eight,18:11.0,18:18.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9651,3,1,T1 ,,then plus ten on both sides,18:18.0,18:26.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9652,3,1,T1 ,no,,18:26.0,18:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9653,3,1,T1 ,actually you wouldn't want to do the plus ten because then you'll have seven k equals yeah so,,18:26.0,18:32.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9654,3,1,T1 ,,you add sixty-eight,18:32.0,18:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9655,3,1,T1 ,yup,,18:34.0,18:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9656,3,1,T1 ,,I'm just going to write over it you know what,18:35.0,18:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9657,3,1,T1 ,,so plus sixty-eight,18:38.0,18:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9658,3,1,T1 ,,so that cancels out,18:41.0,18:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9659,3,1,T1 ,,then,18:43.0,18:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9660,3,1,T1 ,,seventy-eight,18:46.0,18:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9661,3,1,T1 ,,equals seven k,18:50.0,18:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9662,3,1,T1 ,,wait is seventy-eight divided by seven divisible by seven I mean,18:55.0,18:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9663,3,1,T1 ,wait no I think you messed up because that's a negative ten,,18:58.0,19:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9664,3,1,T1 ,so it wouldn't be ten plus sixty,,19:01.0,19:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9665,3,1,T1 ,it would be ten minus it would be sixty-eight minus ten,,19:03.0,19:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9666,3,1,T1 ,,oh,19:07.0,19:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9667,3,1,T1 ,yeah so,,19:09.0,19:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9668,3,1,T1 ,,it would be fifty-eight,19:10.0,19:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9669,3,1,T1 ,,so fifty-eight equals seven k,19:13.0,19:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9670,3,1,T1 ,,so is fifty-eight divisible by a seven,19:15.0,19:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9671,3,1,T1 ,,I can't talk I'm sorry pause filler,19:18.0,19:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9672,3,1,T1 ,pause filler I don't think though because I don't remember that,,19:20.0,19:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9673,3,1,T1 ,fifty-six fifty-eight isn't,,19:23.0,19:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9674,3,1,T1 ,,okay great,19:26.0,19:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9675,3,1,T1 ,so you can just here we go,,19:28.0,19:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9676,3,1,T1 ,,so k equals fifty-eight,19:32.0,19:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9677,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,19:35.0,19:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9678,3,1,T1 ,,all right next stop,19:36.0,19:43.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9679,3,1,T1 ,,,19:43.0,22:16.0,02:33.0,,,,,,
9680,3,1,T1 ,pause filler okay to solve this problem you have to delete all the variables,,19:44.0,19:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9681,3,1,T1 ,,wait so it said come out,19:51.0,19:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9682,3,1,T1 ,,and get us,19:52.0,19:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9683,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,19:53.0,19:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9684,3,1,T1 ,pause filler do you know where they are,,19:54.0,19:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9685,3,1,T1 ,,pause filler I don't but,19:59.0,20:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9686,3,1,T1 ,okay maybe they're outside,,20:01.0,20:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9687,3,1,T1 ,I'll look and you will,,20:04.0,20:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9688,3,1,T1 ,,all right I'll be right back,20:06.0,20:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9689,3,1,T1 ,,all right great,20:41.0,20:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9690,3,1,T1 ,,so she's tutoring me,20:43.0,20:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9691,3,1,T1 ,,,20:45.0,26:25.0,05:40.0,,,,,,
9692,3,1,T1 ,,all right,20:45.0,20:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9693,3,1,T1 ,okay yeah okay (laughter),,20:46.0,20:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9694,3,1,T1 ,so yeah you want to make sure one side has variables and one side doesn't,,20:48.0,20:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9695,3,1,T1 ,so which one do you want to start with,,20:52.0,20:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9696,3,1,T1 ,,pause filler let's just start with the variables,20:57.0,20:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9697,3,1,T1 ,,so you subtract r,20:59.0,21:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9698,3,1,T1 ,,so then you would just end up with r  because you don't say one r because it's all yeah,21:03.0,21:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9699,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,21:07.0,21:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9700,3,1,T1 ,,so you keep the negative thirty-three equals,21:07.0,21:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9701,3,1,T1 ,,r minus fifteen,21:16.0,21:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9702,3,1,T1 ,,and then you add fifteen to both sides right,21:20.0,21:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9703,3,1,T1 ,yup,,21:28.0,21:28.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9704,3,1,T1 ,,so,21:32.0,21:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9705,3,1,T1 ,so then you would that would be,,21:33.0,21:40.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9706,3,1,T1 ,,so negative three plus negative thirty-three plus fifteen,21:40.0,21:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9707,3,1,T1 ,is,,21:44.0,21:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9708,3,1,T1 ,pause filler that's a negative three,,21:46.0,21:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9709,3,1,T1 ,I just want to,,21:48.0,21:56.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9710,3,1,T1 ,pause filler that would be a negative twelve I'm pretty sure,,21:56.0,21:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9711,3,1,T1 ,,oh wait don't you always want to end up with a variable on the left side,22:06.0,22:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9712,3,1,T1 ,pause filler I'm pretty sure that doesn't matter,,22:10.0,22:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9713,3,1,T1 ,but yeah if you want to write that around,,22:12.0,22:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9714,3,1,T1 ,,all right,22:14.0,22:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9715,3,1,T1 ,okay,,22:16.0,22:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9716,3,1,T1 ,,,22:18.0,23:34.0,01:16.0,,,,,,
9717,3,1,T1 ,,negative forty-two plus u equals eight plus four u so,22:18.0,22:22.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9718,3,1,T1 ,so want to get for the variable again,,22:23.0,22:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9719,3,1,T1 ,,yeah you subtract u from both sides,22:26.0,22:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9720,3,1,T1 ,,so you'd end up with negative forty-two equals eight,22:29.0,22:35.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9721,3,1,T1 ,,plus three u now,22:38.0,22:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9722,3,1,T1 ,,so,22:42.0,22:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9723,3,1,T1 ,now you want to get rid of that eight,,22:43.0,22:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9724,3,1,T1 ,oh that's fun underlining stuff (laughter),,22:47.0,22:49.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
9725,3,1,T1 ,,so then you subtract eight from this,22:51.0,22:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9726,3,1,T1 ,,so since it's a negative you would base yeah I'm just thinking of,22:55.0,23:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9727,3,1,T1 ,yes so it would still be a negative,,23:02.0,23:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9728,3,1,T1 ,,oh so yeah it would still be a negative,23:04.0,23:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9729,3,1,T1 ,,so you're basically just adding it,23:06.0,23:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9730,3,1,T1 ,,but it's a negative kind of,23:08.0,23:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9731,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,23:11.0,23:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9732,3,1,T1 ,,yeah yeah so you would obviously end up with negative fifty equals three u,23:11.0,23:18.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9733,3,1,T1 ,,and then fifty isn't divisible by three,23:18.0,23:22.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9734,3,1,T1 ,,so just divide it by three,23:23.0,23:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9735,3,1,T1 ,,and then u equals oh fifty over three,23:26.0,23:32.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9736,3,1,T1 ,,all right,23:32.0,23:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9737,3,1,T1 ,,so,23:35.0,23:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9738,3,1,T1 ,,,23:36.0,24:34.0,00:58.0,,,,,,
9739,3,1,T1 ,I'll pick numbers okay,,23:37.0,23:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9740,3,1,T1 ,,so you're just going to add no subtract n,23:42.0,23:50.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9741,3,1,T1 ,,just forget I put that sign there,23:50.0,23:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9742,3,1,T1 ,,pause filler subtract n from both sides,23:54.0,23:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9743,3,1,T1 ,,so what you end up with one of six equals ninety-nine n plus seven,23:56.0,24:09.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
9744,3,1,T1 ,,and then u,24:11.0,24:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9745,3,1,T1 ,,do you subtract seven next,24:14.0,24:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9746,3,1,T1 ,pause filler yeah you want to subtract the seven,,24:17.0,24:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9747,3,1,T1 ,,so you that you end up with ninety-nine on this side also,24:19.0,24:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9748,3,1,T1 ,,so ninety-nine equals,24:23.0,24:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9749,3,1,T1 ,that would be easy,,24:24.0,24:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9750,3,1,T1 ,,ninety-nine,24:25.0,24:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9751,3,1,T1 ,,and then obviously that divides into one,24:26.0,24:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9752,3,1,T1 ,,so n equals one,24:29.0,24:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9753,3,1,T1 ,,that was an easy problem,24:32.0,24:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9754,3,1,T1 ,yeah that (inaudible) numbers,,24:34.0,24:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9755,3,1,T1 ,,all right,24:36.0,24:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9756,3,1,T1 ,,so,24:38.0,24:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9757,3,1,T1 ,,,24:40.0,26:05.0,01:25.0,,,,,,
9758,3,1,T1 ,yeah,,24:41.0,24:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9759,3,1,T1 ,,fifty-five all right great,24:42.0,24:43.0,00:01.0,,,UL,,,
9760,3,1,T1 ,,so you subtract g this time because,24:43.0,24:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9761,3,1,T1 ,it's so that will less oh I want to try with g,,24:47.0,24:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9762,3,1,T1 ,there we go,,24:54.0,24:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9763,3,1,T1 ,,fifty-five,24:59.0,25:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9764,3,1,T1 ,,I can't even write on this,25:02.0,25:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9765,3,1,T1 ,,wait I'm just going to go back,25:03.0,25:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9766,3,1,T1 ,you want with the,,25:06.0,25:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9767,3,1,T1 ,,all right,25:08.0,25:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9768,3,1,T1 ,,so fifty-five minus,25:09.0,25:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9769,3,1,T1 ,,no like I'm sorry fifty-five equals seven plus twelve g,25:17.0,25:24.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9770,3,1,T1 ,yup,,25:25.0,25:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9771,3,1,T1 ,,so then,25:26.0,25:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9772,3,1,T1 ,,plus,25:29.0,25:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9773,3,1,T1 ,,no it's minus seven right,25:32.0,25:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9774,3,1,T1 ,yeah you want as good as positive,,25:34.0,25:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9775,3,1,T1 ,,so minus seven,25:36.0,25:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9776,3,1,T1 ,,and then that would end up being forty-eight yeah forty-eight,25:38.0,25:44.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9777,3,1,T1 ,yeah forty-eight,,25:44.0,25:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9778,3,1,T1 ,(inaudible) oh yeah because I want to subtract the two,,25:45.0,25:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9779,3,1,T1 ,,so forty-eight is pause filler that's twelve times four right,25:51.0,25:56.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9780,3,1,T1 ,pause filler yeah,,25:58.0,25:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9781,3,1,T1 ,that's what so you'd want to divide the twelve,,25:58.0,26:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9782,3,1,T1 ,,so g equals four great,26:01.0,26:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9783,3,1,T1 ,and okay and,,26:06.0,26:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9784,3,1,T1 ,,,26:10.0,26:25.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
9785,3,1,T1 ,,all right so you would want to start out by subtracting the n,26:12.0,26:19.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9786,3,1,T1 ,,and then doing that on both sides and,26:20.0,26:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9787,3,1,T1 ,,huh,26:30.0,26:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9788,3,1,T1 ,,oh it's doing great,26:32.0,26:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9789,3,1,T1 ,,oh sorry,26:37.0,26:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9790,3,1,T1 ,okay,,27:03.0,27:03.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9791,3,1,T1 ,(laughter) this is weird,,27:03.0,27:24.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
9792,3,1,S2 ,,,27:03.0,32:27.0,05:24.0,,,,,,
9793,3,1,S2 ,this is so weird,,27:25.0,27:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9794,3,1,S2 ,it's like you're holding hands,,27:26.0,27:34.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9795,3,1,S2 ,,these are confusing me,27:34.0,27:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,SD,
9796,3,1,S2 ,the smell,,27:39.0,27:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9797,3,1,S2 ,,they're supposed to be sweet and sour,27:41.0,27:58.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
9798,3,1,S2 ,that is weird,,27:58.0,28:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9799,3,1,S2 ,,yeah,28:01.0,28:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9800,3,1,S2 ,,better eat all the gummy candy I can because I have to get braces,28:02.0,28:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,SD,
9801,3,1,S2 ,,I don't have the exact (inaudible),28:05.0,28:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,SD,

9916,3,1,T2 ,in that case I probably shouldn't be break free,,36:09.0,36:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9917,3,1,T2 ,I am good with it,,36:12.0,36:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9918,3,1,T2 ,we're going to be (inaudible),,36:17.0,36:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9919,3,1,T2 ,okay so start off you want to add three,,36:24.0,36:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9920,3,1,T2 ,,yeah,36:29.0,36:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9921,3,1,T2 ,that was a thirteen (laughter) x equals twenty-five here we go,,36:30.0,36:37.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9922,3,1,T2 ,,all right great,36:37.0,36:42.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9923,3,1,T2 ,let me see,,36:42.0,36:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9924,3,1,T2 ,pause filler you change it do you know how to change it,,36:44.0,36:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9925,3,1,T2 ,or should I change it for you,,36:46.0,36:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9926,3,1,T2 ,oh this is the page I see okay,,36:47.0,36:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9927,3,1,T2 ,,so this is a negative,36:51.0,36:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9928,3,1,T2 ,,so we start off by adding,36:52.0,36:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9929,3,1,T2 ,okay so adding y,,36:55.0,36:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9930,3,1,T2 ,here we go,,36:58.0,36:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9931,3,1,T2 ,wait no not the y,,36:59.0,37:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9932,3,1,T2 ,,oh not the y,37:00.0,37:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9933,3,1,T2 ,but you know I guess you could do that right yeah,,37:01.0,37:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9934,3,1,T2 ,,no no you shouldn't do that,37:05.0,37:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9935,3,1,T2 ,,wait let's go back,37:09.0,37:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9936,3,1,T2 ,,let's go back,37:10.0,37:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9937,3,1,T2 ,,that was wrong (laughter),37:11.0,37:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9938,3,1,T2 ,,okay so you want to start off by subtracting eighteen from both sides,37:13.0,37:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9939,3,1,T2 ,okay okay negative y equals five,,37:19.0,37:28.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9940,3,1,T2 ,,yeah great,37:29.0,37:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9941,3,1,T2 ,,so just remember that pause filler there's a negative in front of it,37:30.0,37:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9942,3,1,T2 ,,so that means that there's a negative one,37:32.0,37:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9943,3,1,T2 ,,so divide that by negative one,37:35.0,37:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9944,3,1,T2 ,,and you'll get your answer,37:37.0,37:42.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9945,3,1,T2 ,okay y equals negative five,,37:42.0,37:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9946,3,1,T2 ,,all right,37:47.0,37:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9947,3,1,T2 ,,all right,37:47.0,37:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9948,3,1,T2 ,,,37:50.0,40:03.0,02:13.0,,,,,,
9949,3,1,T2 ,,this one is a little bit different pause filler,37:50.0,37:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9950,3,1,T2 ,,so what do you think you're going to start off by doing,37:53.0,37:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9951,3,1,T2 ,pause filler so for this one we want since there's pause filler I guess there's two ks,,37:57.0,38:04.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9952,3,1,T2 ,so pause filler you would want to get rid of one of the k,,38:04.0,38:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9953,3,1,T2 ,,yeah you should start off with the variable,38:09.0,38:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9954,3,1,T2 ,so we're going to add a k so that it cancels out the other k,,38:12.0,38:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9955,3,1,T2 ,,(sfx),38:14.0,38:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9956,3,1,T2 ,are you okay,,38:18.0,38:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9957,3,1,T2 ,,yeah I'm okay,38:22.0,38:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9958,3,1,T2 ,,thank you,38:23.0,38:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9959,3,1,T2 ,so we have negative fourteen equals thirty-six plus two k,,38:24.0,38:30.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9960,3,1,T2 ,,all right great,38:30.0,38:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9961,3,1,T2 ,,so you end up with two k,38:33.0,38:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9962,3,1,T2 ,,so now since pause filler this is a negative fourteen,38:35.0,38:42.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9963,3,1,T2 ,,what are you going to need though,38:42.0,38:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9964,3,1,T2 ,I'm going to add it so (inaudible),,38:44.0,38:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9965,3,1,T2 ,,well you would be doing it to the thirty-six remember because that's alone on the other side,38:49.0,38:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9966,3,1,T2 ,yeah but you also want to do it to both sides,,38:56.0,38:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9967,3,1,T2 ,so I guess,,38:59.0,39:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9968,3,1,T2 ,,I know but would you,39:01.0,39:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9969,3,1,T2 ,oh yeah oh that oh oh,,39:02.0,39:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9970,3,1,T2 ,,you would want to be subtracting thirty-six,39:03.0,39:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9971,3,1,T2 ,(laughter) okay I did not see it,,39:11.0,39:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9972,3,1,T2 ,,it's okay,39:15.0,39:15.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9973,3,1,T2 ,,it was my fault,39:15.0,39:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9974,3,1,T2 ,okay so hurry up pause filler,,39:18.0,39:26.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9975,3,1,T2 ,so now you want to subtract with thirty-six,,39:27.0,39:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9976,3,1,T2 ,yeah thirty-six okay,,39:33.0,39:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9977,3,1,T2 ,and then you get pause filler negative fifty equals two k,,39:37.0,39:44.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9978,3,1,T2 ,,all right so then you would want to divide by two on both sides,39:44.0,39:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9979,3,1,T2 ,yeah equals negative twenty-five,,39:53.0,39:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9980,3,1,T2 ,and we're good,,39:59.0,40:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9981,3,1,T2 ,,,40:03.0,41:09.0,01:06.0,,,,,,
9982,3,1,T2 ,,yup,40:03.0,40:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9983,3,1,T2 ,,all right so pause filler for this one you can do you should do the variable first always,40:04.0,40:14.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
9984,3,1,T2 ,,but you should start off by adding b on this side because sorry I just wrote over that pause filler you should start off by adding b because even though they both look the same that pause filler is worth less,40:14.0,40:29.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
9985,3,1,T2 ,,and you should always add and subtract the one that,40:29.0,40:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9986,3,1,T2 ,okay so add b here and like the other following get seventeen thirteen plus two b,,40:33.0,40:44.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
9987,3,1,T2 ,and okay,,40:44.0,40:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9988,3,1,T2 ,so now we need to make sure the b is on only one side,,40:45.0,40:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9989,3,1,T2 ,and to do that you have to subtract the thirteen,,40:50.0,40:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9990,3,1,T2 ,,right,40:53.0,40:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9991,3,1,T2 ,not the seventeen,,40:54.0,40:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9992,3,1,T2 ,and you get four equals two b,,40:56.0,41:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9993,3,1,T2 ,and then you want to divide the two divide the two,,41:00.0,41:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9994,3,1,T2 ,and you get two equals three,,41:04.0,41:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9995,3,1,T2 ,and b equals two,,41:07.0,41:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9996,3,1,T2 ,,,41:10.0,41:41.0,00:31.0,,,,,,
9997,3,1,T2 ,here we go,,41:10.0,41:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9998,3,1,T2 ,,all right so this one is a little bit easier,41:10.0,41:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9999,3,1,T2 ,,and you're multiplying,41:15.0,41:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10000,3,1,T2 ,,so what are you going to do to solve the equation,41:17.0,41:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10001,3,1,T2 ,so this one you want to measure g alone,,41:21.0,41:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10002,3,1,T2 ,and since it's multiplying the negative nine by the g one you divide the negative nine,,41:24.0,41:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10003,3,1,T2 ,,correct,41:28.0,41:28.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10004,3,1,T2 ,that okay negative nine negative nine,,41:29.0,41:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10005,3,1,T2 ,and g equals negative nine,,41:34.0,41:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10006,3,1,T2 ,there we go,,41:39.0,41:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10007,3,1,T2 ,,,41:42.0,42:38.0,00:56.0,,,,,,
10008,3,1,T2 ,,all right great,41:42.0,41:44.0,00:02.0,,,UL,,,
10009,3,1,T2 ,,and now next,41:44.0,41:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10010,3,1,T2 ,,all right so for this one it's different than the last one,41:46.0,41:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10011,3,1,T2 ,,and it's like what we've been doing but pause filler you would be subtracting ten to start off,41:50.0,41:58.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10012,3,1,T2 ,I see so seventy-two,,41:59.0,42:08.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10013,3,1,T2 ,okay so now you want to get rid of the eight right,,42:13.0,42:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10014,3,1,T2 ,,yes,42:18.0,42:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10015,3,1,T2 ,,so you would have to pause filler divide by negative eight in both sides,42:18.0,42:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10016,3,1,T2 ,,and let me know if you need help on that,42:23.0,42:29.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10017,3,1,T2 ,(inaudible) that's nine,,42:31.0,42:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10018,3,1,T2 ,,yeah,42:32.0,42:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10019,3,1,T2 ,,well you remember it would be negative nine,42:33.0,42:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10020,3,1,T2 ,yeah so there we go,,42:36.0,42:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10021,3,1,T2 ,,great,42:38.0,42:38.0,00:00.0,,,UL,,,
10022,3,1,T2 ,,all right next page,42:38.0,42:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10023,3,1,T2 ,,,42:40.0,44:24.0,01:44.0,,,,,,
10024,3,1,T2 ,,one hundred seventy equals sixty-five minus fourteen x,42:40.0,42:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10025,3,1,T2 ,okay so for this one you want to subtract the sixty-five,,42:45.0,42:51.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10026,3,1,T2 ,here we go,,42:55.0,42:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10027,3,1,T2 ,yup,,42:56.0,42:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10028,3,1,T2 ,,all right all right,43:01.0,43:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10029,3,1,T2 ,,so you just make sure you know that like you seem to be you seem to know,43:07.0,43:14.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10030,3,1,T2 ,,but I mean just the role is always like depending on whether it's positive or negative just add or subtract and everything,43:14.0,43:23.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10031,3,1,T2 ,yeah okay so pause filler now we got to subtract okay one hundred seven sixty-five is two like,,43:23.0,43:32.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10032,3,1,T2 ,I'm going to say that's forty-two,,43:32.0,43:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10033,3,1,T2 ,so forty-two equals negative fourteen x,,43:38.0,43:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10034,3,1,T2 ,,yeah yeah,43:48.0,43:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10035,3,1,T2 ,okay so and how we will want to pause filler divide by negative fourteen,,43:49.0,43:55.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10036,3,1,T2 ,not the x,,43:58.0,44:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10037,3,1,T2 ,,so pause filler is ninety-two divided by negative I can't talk is ninety-two divided by divisible by negative fourteen,44:01.0,44:09.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10038,3,1,T2 ,actually maybe let's see,,44:10.0,44:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10039,3,1,T2 ,wait fourteen times three happens,,44:11.0,44:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10040,3,1,T2 ,yup,,44:15.0,44:15.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10041,3,1,T2 ,yeah so we have pause filler x equals negative three,,44:16.0,44:23.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10042,3,1,T2 ,,great,44:23.0,44:24.0,00:01.0,,,UL,,,
10043,3,1,T2 ,,all right onto the next problem,44:24.0,44:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10044,3,1,T2 ,,,44:24.0,45:18.0,00:54.0,,,,,,
10045,3,1,T2 ,,you're moving fast,44:28.0,44:29.0,00:01.0,,,0,,,
10046,3,1,T2 ,,all right so pause filler this has bigger numbers in it,44:30.0,44:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10047,3,1,T2 ,,but you would start off by adding what number,44:34.0,44:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10048,3,1,T2 ,forty-one,,44:39.0,44:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10049,3,1,T2 ,,yup,44:39.0,44:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10050,3,1,T2 ,that looks like an h,,44:39.0,44:48.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10051,3,1,T2 ,yeah that's horrible,,44:48.0,44:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10052,3,1,T2 ,pause filler yes so that would be seventy-five equals negative nine k divided by the negative nine,,44:52.0,45:00.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10053,3,1,T2 ,,,44:52.0,45:00.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10054,3,1,T2 ,,so you just want to make that equal on both sides,45:01.0,45:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10055,3,1,T2 ,would you say seventy-five divided by negative nine,,45:10.0,45:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10056,3,1,T2 ,here we go,,45:16.0,45:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10057,3,1,T2 ,,all right great,45:16.0,45:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10058,3,1,T2 ,,,45:19.0,46:32.0,01:13.0,,,,,,
10059,3,1,T2 ,,so now this one is a lot different,45:19.0,45:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10060,3,1,T2 ,,so pause filler you would have to start off by adding p to both sides,45:23.0,45:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10061,3,1,T2 ,,so what would you add it to on the other side,45:27.0,45:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10062,3,1,T2 ,so I guess you want to so that would be nine p,,45:30.0,45:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10063,3,1,T2 ,so you want to add the p yeah,,45:33.0,45:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10064,3,1,T2 ,so if you do it to both sides we got the negative fifty-two here,,45:36.0,45:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10065,3,1,T2 ,we got the nine p over here,,45:40.0,45:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10066,3,1,T2 ,we got the negative sixteen which we need to now add so that,,45:42.0,45:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10067,3,1,T2 ,,yeah just remember that you always have to keep that negative there because that's important,45:48.0,45:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10068,3,1,T2 ,so it would be fifty-two minus sixteen which happens to be fourteen that would be forty,,45:55.0,46:02.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10069,3,1,T2 ,I'm pretty sure that would be thirty-six,,46:02.0,46:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10070,3,1,T2 ,,yeah,46:08.0,46:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10071,3,1,T2 ,that seems like (inaudible) okay thirty-six equals nine p,,46:08.0,46:14.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10072,3,1,T2 ,pause filler okay so then we want to divide it by nine,,46:17.0,46:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10073,3,1,T2 ,and we get pause filler,,46:20.0,46:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10074,3,1,T2 ,,four,46:23.0,46:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10075,3,1,T2 ,p equals four,,46:23.0,46:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10076,3,1,T2 ,I feel like there's a lot of nines in here okay,,46:25.0,46:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10077,3,1,T2 ,,all right great,46:30.0,46:32.0,00:02.0,,,UL,,,
10078,3,1,T2 ,(inaudible),,46:32.0,46:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10079,3,1,T2 ,,,46:33.0,47:57.0,01:24.0,,,,,,
10080,3,1,T2 ,,next one up and,46:33.0,46:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10081,3,1,T2 ,,so you're going to add,46:36.0,46:41.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10082,3,1,T2 ,the pause filler fourteen w,,46:44.0,46:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10083,3,1,T2 ,,yes,46:46.0,46:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10084,3,1,T2 ,,so that equals,46:47.0,46:57.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10085,3,1,T2 ,pause filler negative forty-one equals,,46:57.0,47:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10086,3,1,T2 ,pause filler I'll say forty forty w,,47:03.0,47:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10087,3,1,T2 ,,correct,47:10.0,47:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10088,3,1,T2 ,oh wait and we don't want to figure about that nineteen plus,,47:11.0,47:16.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10089,3,1,T2 ,okay so now subtract the nineteen,,47:17.0,47:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10090,3,1,T2 ,and okay to make it a hundred,,47:24.0,47:29.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10091,3,1,T2 ,be a negative a hundred sixty equals forty w,,47:31.0,47:36.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10092,3,1,T2 ,here we go,,47:38.0,47:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10093,3,1,T2 ,okay (inaudible) by forty and that would be negative four,,47:41.0,47:48.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10094,3,1,T2 ,yeah w equals negative four,,47:48.0,47:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10095,3,1,T2 ,,yeah because remember just regular sixteen divided by four equals four so,47:51.0,47:57.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10096,3,1,T2 ,yeah I wonder what all these buttons are doing okay,,47:57.0,48:05.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10097,3,1,T2 ,pause filler continuing on,,48:06.0,48:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10098,3,1,T2 ,,all right great okay,48:09.0,48:10.0,00:01.0,,,UL,,,
10099,3,1,T2 ,pause filler is he over there,,48:10.0,48:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10100,3,1,T2 ,,I'll go get him,48:11.0,48:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10101,3,1,T2 ,okay because I think,,48:16.0,48:30.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
10102,3,1,T2 ,oh candy candy candy oh candy candy,,48:30.0,48:38.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10103,3,1,T2 ,,all right great,48:45.0,48:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10104,3,1,T2 ,,,48:47.0,54:25.0,05:38.0,,,,,,
10105,3,1,T2 ,okay so all right,,48:47.0,48:56.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10106,3,1,T2 ,,,48:54.0,50:40.0,01:46.0,,,,,,
10107,3,1,T2 ,,so first you want to start off by adding y because it's negative n,48:56.0,49:05.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10108,3,1,T2 ,and then we get negative sixty-three equals forty-three plus two y,,49:05.0,49:15.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10109,3,1,T2 ,,so what do you think the next step is,49:18.0,49:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10110,3,1,T2 ,I think well we've got to get rid of that forty-three,,49:22.0,49:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10111,3,1,T2 ,kill it,,49:25.0,49:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10112,3,1,T2 ,okay so we want to subtract forty-three forty-three,,49:25.0,49:31.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10113,3,1,T2 ,,that cancels,49:31.0,49:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10114,3,1,T2 ,yeah yeah like here we go,,49:34.0,49:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10115,3,1,T2 ,oh come on now okay pause filler,,49:40.0,49:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10116,3,1,T2 ,yeah we want to pause filler add yeah subtract them together,,49:44.0,49:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10117,3,1,T2 ,we got a hundred and six equals two y,,49:48.0,49:55.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10118,3,1,T2 ,so divide it by two,,49:56.0,49:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10119,3,1,T2 ,and get y equals fifty-three pause filler,,50:01.0,50:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10120,3,1,T2 ,,all right so,50:08.0,50:18.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10121,3,1,T2 ,,oh gosh,50:19.0,50:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10122,3,1,T2 ,well page you messed up,,50:20.0,50:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10123,3,1,T2 ,,I can't even see what you're doing anymore,50:23.0,50:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10124,3,1,T2 ,it's so on,,50:28.0,50:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10125,3,1,T2 ,okay maybe we should just go to the next one,,50:33.0,50:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10126,3,1,T2 ,,yeah did you get the answer,50:36.0,50:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10127,3,1,T2 ,mm-hmm y equals fifty-three,,50:38.0,50:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

10129,3,1,T2 ,,,50:42.0,52:03.0,01:21.0,,,,,,
10130,3,1,T2 ,okay now they're all like negative p and positive p,,50:42.0,50:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10131,3,1,T2 ,,yeah so you would want to start up by adding p,50:47.0,50:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10132,3,1,T2 ,equals two p okay,,51:02.0,51:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10133,3,1,T2 ,and then pause filler you want to pause filler get rid of three,,51:06.0,51:13.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10134,3,1,T2 ,that was totally necessary,,51:15.0,51:25.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10135,3,1,T2 ,pause filler see pause filler a hundred ninety pause filler negative,,51:27.0,51:36.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10136,3,1,T2 ,pause filler thirty equals two p,,51:44.0,51:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10137,3,1,T2 ,,great,51:47.0,51:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

10286,3,2,S1 ,so she noticed it,,06:54.0,06:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10287,3,2,S1 ,and yeah I decided I'd do it,,06:55.0,06:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10288,3,2,S1 ,,yeah,06:59.0,06:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10289,3,2,S1 ,so,,06:59.0,06:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10290,3,2,S1 ,,it's not too long you get money,07:00.0,07:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10291,3,2,S1 ,yeah money is nice,,07:04.0,07:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10292,3,2,S1 ,,yeah but it's a good experience also,07:05.0,07:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10293,3,2,S1 ,yeah (inaudible),,07:09.0,07:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10294,3,2,S1 ,,thank you,07:17.0,07:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10295,3,2,S1 ,I have a question,,07:18.0,07:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10296,3,2,S1 ,is there a way to turn this down a little bit,,07:19.0,07:25.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10297,3,2,S1 ,,all right,07:25.0,07:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10298,3,2,S1 ,(inaudible) all right thanks,,07:26.0,07:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10299,3,2,T1 ,,,08:06.0,28:26.0,20:20.0,,,,,,
10300,3,2,T1 ,,,08:08.0,11:05.0,02:57.0,,,,,,
10301,3,2,T1 ,pause filler okay (laughter),,08:09.0,08:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10302,3,2,T1 ,,so do you know how to do this,08:10.0,08:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10303,3,2,T1 ,,you've learned this in school right,08:13.0,08:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10304,3,2,T1 ,yeah so okay so yeah,,08:15.0,08:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10305,3,2,T1 ,the first thing is you want to get x alone,,08:19.0,08:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10306,3,2,T1 ,you want to get rid of those the three over seven pause filler,,08:22.0,08:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10307,3,2,T1 ,,yes so then you would have to well on the sheet it was like saying that you would have to do seven x,08:27.0,08:36.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10308,3,2,T1 ,,but I guess that's not,08:36.0,08:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10309,3,2,T1 ,,well never mind,08:38.0,08:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10310,3,2,T1 ,yeah so there's like two ways to do this,,08:40.0,08:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10311,3,2,T1 ,you could either divide x plus three over seven,,08:42.0,08:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10312,3,2,T1 ,or you could multiply it plus three over seven,,08:46.0,08:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10313,3,2,T1 ,,yes so you would have to divide it by three sevens,08:50.0,08:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10314,3,2,T1 ,yeah or we could multiply it by the reciprocal,,08:54.0,08:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10315,3,2,T1 ,because that would also work,,08:58.0,08:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10316,3,2,T1 ,because that would turn it into one,,08:59.0,09:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10317,3,2,T1 ,,yeah yeah yeah,09:01.0,09:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10318,3,2,T1 ,,so what do you think,09:02.0,09:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10319,3,2,T1 ,,what do you,09:04.0,09:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10320,3,2,T1 ,pause filler I mean it all depends,,09:06.0,09:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10321,3,2,T1 ,would you rather divide forty or,,09:09.0,09:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10322,3,2,T1 ,would you rather multiply over forty,,09:12.0,09:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10323,3,2,T1 ,probably multiplying might be easier than dividing forty,,09:14.0,09:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10324,3,2,T1 ,,all right then teach me how to do that then,09:18.0,09:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10325,3,2,T1 ,okay okay that's weird oh okay yeah,,09:23.0,09:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10326,3,2,T1 ,so you would want to do is,,09:28.0,09:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10327,3,2,T1 ,you would want to just put like forty over here,,09:30.0,09:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10328,3,2,T1 ,so that works,,09:36.0,09:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10329,3,2,T1 ,so you I guess you would want to write out forty if you're going to multiply that,,09:39.0,09:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10330,3,2,T1 ,,all right so then,09:45.0,09:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10331,3,2,T1 ,so then pause filler if we're going to multiply it pause filler you're going to just write over here three over seven,,09:50.0,09:58.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10332,3,2,T1 ,or seven over three yeah,,09:58.0,10:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10333,3,2,T1 ,and you want to do a reciprocal,,10:00.0,10:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10334,3,2,T1 ,,yeah,10:02.0,10:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10335,3,2,T1 ,and I assume you know how to multiply fractions right,,10:04.0,10:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10336,3,2,T1 ,,I actually haven't learned this for like a year or two,10:07.0,10:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10337,3,2,T1 ,,so just refresh me on it,10:10.0,10:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10338,3,2,T1 ,,I kind of remember but,10:13.0,10:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10339,3,2,T1 ,so pause filler basically it's like multiplying normally except,,10:17.0,10:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10340,3,2,T1 ,you want to multiply the forty times seven and the one times three,,10:20.0,10:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10341,3,2,T1 ,,okay okay yeah yeah,10:27.0,10:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10342,3,2,T1 ,you just multiply straight across so you get,,10:29.0,10:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10343,3,2,T1 ,,two hundred eighty,10:32.0,10:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10344,3,2,T1 ,yeah,,10:33.0,10:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10345,3,2,T1 ,,over three right,10:37.0,10:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10346,3,2,T1 ,,and then does that pause filler does that simplify,10:41.0,10:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10347,3,2,T1 ,yea,,10:41.0,10:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10348,3,2,T1 ,pause filler no,,10:45.0,10:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10349,3,2,T1 ,,all right,10:47.0,10:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10350,3,2,T1 ,no,,10:47.0,10:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10351,3,2,T1 ,see pause filler I guess you could just say that,,10:48.0,10:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10352,3,2,T1 ,because it would be okay,,10:53.0,10:59.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10353,3,2,T1 ,because you know you probably know (inaudible) okay,,10:59.0,11:05.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10354,3,2,T1 ,,all right next up,11:05.0,11:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10355,3,2,T1 ,,,11:05.0,11:38.0,00:33.0,,,,,,
10356,3,2,T1 ,,so now do you want to multiply from the reciprocal again,11:06.0,11:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10357,3,2,T1 ,,so fourteen,11:11.0,11:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10358,3,2,T1 ,yeah,,11:12.0,11:12.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10359,3,2,T1 ,,time eight over three,11:14.0,11:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10360,3,2,T1 ,,and then that's over one so fourteen times eight,11:20.0,11:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10361,3,2,T1 ,,oh gosh what is fourteen times eight,11:25.0,11:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10362,3,2,T1 ,see pause filler seven time eight is fifty-six,,11:27.0,11:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10363,3,2,T1 ,fifty-six times two a hundred and twelve,,11:29.0,11:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10364,3,2,T1 ,,all right thank you,11:33.0,11:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10365,3,2,T1 ,,over three,11:35.0,11:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10366,3,2,T1 ,,,11:38.0,13:35.0,01:57.0,,,,,,
10367,3,2,T1 ,yeah,,11:38.0,11:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10368,3,2,T1 ,,all right so next up,11:38.0,11:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10369,3,2,T1 ,,okay so,11:43.0,11:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10370,3,2,T1 ,okay yeah for this one this one you just have you're adding an extra step to it,,11:46.0,11:52.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10371,3,2,T1 ,so the first thing want to do is make sure y is alone on this,,11:52.0,11:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10372,3,2,T1 ,,all right so you're adding eighteen to both sides,11:57.0,12:04.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10373,3,2,T1 ,,so that will equal seventy right,12:05.0,12:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10374,3,2,T1 ,pause filler yeah,,12:10.0,12:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10375,3,2,T1 ,,so seventy negative two thirds y sorry my writing is so messy equals seventy,12:12.0,12:24.0,00:12.0,,SV,,,,
10376,3,2,T1 ,,so you want to do seventy times wait three,12:26.0,12:37.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
10377,3,2,T1 ,yeah you wanted to make sure there's a three,,12:37.0,12:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10378,3,2,T1 ,,yeah wait let me go back,12:38.0,12:49.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
10379,3,2,T1 ,okay you want to just multiply,,12:51.0,12:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10380,3,2,T1 ,,seven times two equals (inaudible),12:54.0,13:04.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10381,3,2,T1 ,,and then that would equal to one hundred five,13:08.0,13:14.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10382,3,2,T1 ,yeah maybe you could probably just put a y equals,,13:14.0,13:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10383,3,2,T1 ,,yeah so finally it's our y equals one hundred,13:18.0,13:25.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10384,3,2,T1 ,except one thing you forgot to do is,,13:25.0,13:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10385,3,2,T1 ,I'm pretty sure the one o five would be a negative because yeah,,13:27.0,13:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10386,3,2,T1 ,you know y was a negative so,,13:33.0,13:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10387,3,2,T1 ,,all right next up,13:35.0,13:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10388,3,2,T1 ,,,13:35.0,14:31.0,00:56.0,,,,,,
10389,3,2,T1 ,,all right so same thing here,13:42.0,13:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10390,3,2,T1 ,yeah,,13:47.0,13:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10391,3,2,T1 ,,so you would want to do minus thirteen on both sides,13:48.0,13:54.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10392,3,2,T1 ,,and that would equal one x equals thirty-one,13:55.0,14:07.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
10393,3,2,T1 ,,then thirty-one over three times two over one equals sixty-two,14:08.0,14:16.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10394,3,2,T1 ,yep,,14:16.0,14:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10395,3,2,T1 ,,so would it be x equals sixty-two then,14:19.0,14:25.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10396,3,2,T1 ,yeah as you said,,14:25.0,14:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10397,3,2,T1 ,because you can't really do you could divide it by one but that would still be a sixty-two,,14:27.0,14:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10398,3,2,T1 ,,yeah okay so this is a little bit different because it's like on the other side,14:31.0,14:40.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10399,3,2,T1 ,,,14:31.0,16:14.0,01:43.0,,,,,,
10400,3,2,T1 ,,but it's still the same so,14:40.0,14:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10401,3,2,T1 ,yeah,,14:42.0,14:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10402,3,2,T1 ,,add sixteen to both sides so then you I'm just going to flip this around so three,14:43.0,14:53.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10403,3,2,T1 ,,actually I'm just going to go six over three equals,14:55.0,15:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10404,3,2,T1 ,,my gosh it's not even showing up,15:00.0,15:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10405,3,2,T1 ,it's not,,15:07.0,15:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10406,3,2,T1 ,,wait one second,15:08.0,15:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10407,3,2,T1 ,,this tip like lagging,15:10.0,15:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10408,3,2,T1 ,okay,,15:12.0,15:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10409,3,2,T1 ,,forty-seven over pause filler,15:15.0,15:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10410,3,2,T1 ,,so then oh gosh what's six times forty-seven,15:20.0,15:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10411,3,2,T1 ,pause filler well one thing you could do let's see wait (inaudible),,15:23.0,15:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10412,3,2,T1 ,I guess before you do that you maybe you could simplify pause filler the sixty over three to like two,,15:26.0,15:36.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10413,3,2,T1 ,that might help you,,15:37.0,15:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10414,3,2,T1 ,,oh yeah so three over one so forty-seven time two equals pause filler fifty-four right,15:38.0,15:49.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
10415,3,2,T1 ,well not times two forty-seven would be eighty but mostly fourteen ninety-four because it wouldn't,,15:51.0,16:01.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10416,3,2,T1 ,,yeah so ninety-four and then pause filler,16:01.0,16:08.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10417,3,2,T1 ,,that would be over that would just be ninety-four,16:08.0,16:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10418,3,2,T1 ,,so x equals ninety-four,16:12.0,16:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10419,3,2,T1 ,,I haven't done the reciprocal for a long time,16:19.0,16:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10420,3,2,T1 ,,so that's why I'm just,16:21.0,16:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10421,3,2,T1 ,it is fun,,16:25.0,16:26.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
10422,3,2,T1 ,,,16:26.0,18:40.0,02:14.0,,,,,,
10423,3,2,T1 ,,so big numbers now,16:26.0,16:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10424,3,2,T1 ,,minus,16:28.0,16:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10425,3,2,T1 ,yeah,,16:31.0,16:31.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10426,3,2,T1 ,,forty-eight so,16:32.0,16:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10427,3,2,T1 ,yeah so you want to subtract,,16:33.0,16:43.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10428,3,2,T1 ,,would that be forty-nine,16:43.0,16:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10429,3,2,T1 ,yeah,,16:48.0,16:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10430,3,2,T1 ,,all right,16:48.0,16:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10431,3,2,T1 ,,all right so so that would be five over twelve there,16:52.0,17:01.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10432,3,2,T1 ,yeah,,17:01.0,17:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10433,3,2,T1 ,,here I'm just going to,17:03.0,17:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10434,3,2,T1 ,yeah okay,,17:14.0,17:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10435,3,2,T1 ,and that would be a y right (inaudible),,17:15.0,17:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10436,3,2,T1 ,,all right so forty-nine times five,17:17.0,17:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10437,3,2,T1 ,,I wish there was a calculator gosh,17:23.0,17:26.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
10438,3,2,T1 ,I know,,17:26.0,17:26.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
10439,3,2,T1 ,,so nine times five equals pause filler forty-five sorry forty-five,17:27.0,17:38.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
10440,3,2,T1 ,forty-five,,17:39.0,17:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10441,3,2,T1 ,and that equals to a hundred well,,17:40.0,17:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10442,3,2,T1 ,,one hundred sixty-five,17:45.0,17:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10443,3,2,T1 ,no wait that wait,,17:48.0,17:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10444,3,2,T1 ,forty-five does a hundred and forty-five,,17:49.0,17:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10445,3,2,T1 ,because forty times five equals two hundred so,,17:51.0,17:57.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10446,3,2,T1 ,,are you sure it's not a hundred sixty-five,17:57.0,18:04.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10447,3,2,T1 ,wait maybe,,18:04.0,18:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10448,3,2,T1 ,oh wait yeah it's forty-nine,,18:05.0,18:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10449,3,2,T1 ,yeah forty-nine times five equals five okay,,18:09.0,18:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10450,3,2,T1 ,that's like okay so that's your five right pause filler,,18:15.0,18:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10451,3,2,T1 ,so you have four over pause filler,,18:20.0,18:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10452,3,2,T1 ,then as you go like that because you have to have zero there,,18:23.0,18:31.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10453,3,2,T1 ,and that's yeah,,18:31.0,18:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10454,3,2,T1 ,so it would be two hundred forty-five and pause filler five (inaudible),,18:32.0,18:40.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10455,3,2,T1 ,,all right next page,18:40.0,18:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10456,3,2,T1 ,,,18:40.0,23:55.0,05:15.0,,,,,,
10457,3,2,T1 ,,oh gosh all right,18:43.0,18:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10458,3,2,T1 ,,so this one is going to be plus sixty-one to both sides,18:45.0,18:51.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10459,3,2,T1 ,yup,,18:51.0,18:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10460,3,2,T1 ,,and then you also want to add the two ys y thing right,18:51.0,18:57.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10461,3,2,T1 ,,because that's like (inaudible),18:58.0,18:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10462,3,2,T1 ,yeah so yeah,,18:59.0,19:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10463,3,2,T1 ,because there is two ones I really want one,,19:00.0,19:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10464,3,2,T1 ,,what just happened,19:05.0,19:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10465,3,2,T1 ,wait a minute,,19:07.0,19:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10466,3,2,T1 ,so would you really want to so wait which side would you want to have your y on before you do this,,19:08.0,19:17.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10467,3,2,T1 ,,pause filler I guess this side,19:19.0,19:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10468,3,2,T1 ,,like this side over here,19:21.0,19:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10469,3,2,T1 ,oh so for that you'd have to subtract the y pause filler,,19:24.0,19:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10470,3,2,T1 ,no so that would be harder than adding the y over here,,19:27.0,19:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10471,3,2,T1 ,because I guess if you add it over here then you would get pause filler,,19:32.0,19:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10472,3,2,T1 ,oh wait (inaudible),,19:37.0,19:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10473,3,2,T1 ,huh huh,,19:37.0,19:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10474,3,2,T1 ,I guess it doesn't make a difference,,19:39.0,19:47.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10475,3,2,T1 ,but the y would be you'd have the negative y if you do it this way,,19:47.0,19:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10476,3,2,T1 ,or you have a positive y if you did it that way,,19:52.0,19:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10477,3,2,T1 ,so that yeah it doesn't matter that much,,19:56.0,19:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10478,3,2,T1 ,so I guess yeah,,19:58.0,19:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10479,3,2,T1 ,,just work through the first step really quick because I'm confused just,20:00.0,20:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10480,3,2,T1 ,,I'm sorry,20:04.0,20:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10481,3,2,T1 ,yeah pause filler,,20:05.0,20:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10482,3,2,T1 ,yeah not subtracting sixty-one I mean this one is like a smaller one so I mean,,20:08.0,20:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10483,3,2,T1 ,usually we'll do the one that was smaller but it doesn't matter exactly,,20:15.0,20:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10484,3,2,T1 ,,well this one is smaller right,20:23.0,20:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10485,3,2,T1 ,,oh yeah so,20:24.0,20:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10486,3,2,T1 ,I mean when I add the sixty-five just sixty-one yeah,,20:25.0,20:31.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10487,3,2,T1 ,,all right so twenty-five,20:33.0,20:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10488,3,2,T1 ,eight-six,,20:39.0,20:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10489,3,2,T1 ,,yeah,20:40.0,20:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10490,3,2,T1 ,okay,,20:55.0,20:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10491,3,2,T1 ,,oh wait no that's equals,20:56.0,20:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10492,3,2,T1 ,,oh my gosh,20:58.0,20:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10493,3,2,T1 ,,I'll just,21:00.0,21:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10494,3,2,T1 ,,and then pause filler,21:01.0,21:07.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10495,3,2,T1 ,,so then you would sub you would oh so how do you add this then,21:10.0,21:22.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
10496,3,2,T1 ,,because it's like,21:22.0,21:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10497,3,2,T1 ,oh wait,,21:23.0,21:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10498,3,2,T1 ,so you want to get rid of the wait so now you want to subtract the y right,,21:24.0,21:29.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10499,3,2,T1 ,because you only have y on one side,,21:29.0,21:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10500,3,2,T1 ,and so if you got rid of that y,,21:31.0,21:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10501,3,2,T1 ,then you would have like a zero so,,21:33.0,21:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10502,3,2,T1 ,,so would that be negative six over six y then,21:37.0,21:44.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10503,3,2,T1 ,pause filler six,,21:44.0,21:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10504,3,2,T1 ,wait,,21:44.0,21:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10505,3,2,T1 ,,like what is going to get six over seven minus one,21:46.0,21:54.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10506,3,2,T1 ,,because y is one basically,21:54.0,21:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10507,3,2,T1 ,well so when you're subtracting that y the y pause filler is really just can be pause filler a negative seven over seven y right,,21:56.0,22:09.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
10508,3,2,T1 ,so then it would just be a negative thirteen over seven y when you subtract them together,,22:09.0,22:20.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
10509,3,2,T1 ,,all right,22:21.0,22:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10510,3,2,T1 ,,so,22:25.0,22:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10511,3,2,T1 ,so then once you have that y,,22:29.0,22:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10512,3,2,T1 ,you have that,,22:39.0,22:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10513,3,2,T1 ,and then you just want to multiply it by seven over thirteen,,22:46.0,22:52.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10514,3,2,T1 ,mm-hmm that's lovely,,22:52.0,22:54.0,00:02.0,,,,LPP,,
10515,3,2,T1 ,,so what's eighty-six times seven,22:55.0,22:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10516,3,2,T1 ,pause filler I don't know,,22:59.0,23:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10517,3,2,T1 ,okay (inaudible) okay eight six times seven two two,,23:02.0,23:08.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10518,3,2,T1 ,and for the four (inaudible) six fifty-six plus four sixty-eight pause filler,,23:08.0,23:19.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
10519,3,2,T1 ,maybe six hundred and two,,23:19.0,23:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10520,3,2,T1 ,,all right that's so close so six hundred two and then pause filler that is over negative thirteen,23:23.0,23:38.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
10521,3,2,T1 ,yeah,,23:40.0,23:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10522,3,2,T1 ,,like I'm just going to go with that you know (laughter),23:41.0,23:50.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10523,3,2,T1 ,put a little negative sign then,,23:51.0,23:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10524,3,2,T1 ,there we go,,23:54.0,23:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10525,3,2,T1 ,,all right let's move onto the next one,23:55.0,23:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10526,3,2,T1 ,,,23:56.0,28:26.0,04:30.0,,,,,,
10527,3,2,T1 ,,all right so let's just start off by adding a two,23:59.0,24:08.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10528,3,2,T1 ,,so this cancels out then it,24:20.0,24:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10529,3,2,T1 ,and then you just have,,24:30.0,24:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10530,3,2,T1 ,,one hundred yeah (laughter) so,24:31.0,24:36.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10531,3,2,T1 ,yep,,24:34.0,24:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10532,3,2,T1 ,you have,,24:37.0,24:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10533,3,2,T1 ,,plus ten over third x,24:39.0,24:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10534,3,2,T1 ,,and then negative eleven x is left over on the other side,24:42.0,24:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10535,3,2,T1 ,,so now you want to add eleven x right,24:47.0,24:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10536,3,2,T1 ,,so then would that be if you're adding eleven x would that be,24:54.0,25:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10537,3,2,T1 ,pause filler wait if you're adding wait if you're adding elevenx,,25:00.0,25:10.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10538,3,2,T1 ,,would that be eleven and then ten over three,25:10.0,25:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10539,3,2,T1 ,okay if you're going to do that then on the other side you have zero equals scribble,,25:15.0,25:24.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10540,3,2,T1 ,so then you only want you want to have x on one side and the hundred on the other,,25:25.0,25:33.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10541,3,2,T1 ,so you don't want to do that,,25:33.0,25:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10542,3,2,T1 ,you would either have to pause filler put the hundred on the other side or,,25:37.0,25:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10543,3,2,T1 ,you would have to subtract your ten x (inaudible),,25:41.0,25:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10544,3,2,T1 ,do you get that,,25:45.0,25:52.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10545,3,2,T1 ,,all right so pause filler,25:54.0,25:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10546,3,2,T1 ,so which one would you rather do,,25:55.0,26:02.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10547,3,2,T1 ,so you could either subtract a hundred,,26:03.0,26:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10548,3,2,T1 ,or you could subtract ten x,,26:06.0,26:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10549,3,2,T1 ,the ten x will probably have less steps in here because you already put a hundred on one side,,26:10.0,26:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10550,3,2,T1 ,,all right so subtract ten x,26:15.0,26:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10551,3,2,T1 ,,so that would be negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three,26:22.0,26:39.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
10552,3,2,T1 ,wait wait pause filler,,26:41.0,26:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10553,3,2,T1 ,it doesn't look right,,26:45.0,26:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10554,3,2,T1 ,,three x or three,26:50.0,26:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10555,3,2,T1 ,well you pause filler wait one second sorry,,26:53.0,27:02.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10556,3,2,T1 ,,it's okay,27:02.0,27:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10557,3,2,T1 ,wait a minute pause filler,,27:04.0,27:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10558,3,2,T1 ,I'm sorry I like zoned out for a couple second wait,,27:05.0,27:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10559,3,2,T1 ,so you added the eleven x,,27:09.0,27:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10560,3,2,T1 ,is that what you ended up doing,,27:13.0,27:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10561,3,2,T1 ,,pause filler I well then you say that you could subtract ten x from both sides,27:20.0,27:27.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10562,3,2,T1 ,yeah so is that what you did,,27:27.0,27:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10563,3,2,T1 ,,yeah so,27:29.0,27:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10564,3,2,T1 ,okay so,,27:29.0,27:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10565,3,2,T1 ,,so negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three,27:29.0,27:35.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10566,3,2,T1 ,no no no,,27:35.0,27:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10567,3,2,T1 ,so your question is would it be a negative twenty-one x,,27:35.0,27:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10568,3,2,T1 ,because you still have to divide it by three,,27:40.0,27:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10569,3,2,T1 ,so I'm pretty sure it won't,,27:42.0,27:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10570,3,2,T1 ,but yeah I'm getting confused,,27:44.0,27:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10571,3,2,T1 ,wait no wait no,,27:46.0,27:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10572,3,2,T1 ,you can't do that yeah because pause filler yeah you can't put the divided by three thing underneath that because that wouldn't work,,27:49.0,27:57.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10573,3,2,T1 ,so ten over three,,27:58.0,28:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10574,3,2,T1 ,,so you would have to,28:03.0,28:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10575,3,2,T1 ,so your negative eleven x because negative eleven is like over one and,,28:04.0,28:13.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10576,3,2,T1 ,,wouldn't you multiply it by three x probably,28:13.0,28:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10577,3,2,T1 ,well you're not trying to get rid well you're trying to get rid on that side by subtraction not multiplication,,28:17.0,28:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10578,3,2,T1 ,so what you can do,,28:24.0,28:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10579,3,2,T1 ,,It's going good,28:27.0,28:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10580,3,2,T1 ,,all right,28:33.0,28:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10581,3,2,T1 ,,okay,28:49.0,28:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10582,3,2,T1 ,okay,,28:51.0,28:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10583,3,2,T1 ,okay,,28:58.0,28:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10584,3,2,S2 ,,,29:35.0,35:39.0,06:04.0,,,,,,
10585,3,2,S2 ,,okay,29:36.0,29:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10586,3,2,S2 ,,what did you get,29:36.0,29:41.0,00:05.0,,,,,QE,
10587,3,2,S2 ,Skittles as well,,29:41.0,29:48.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10588,3,2,S2 ,I haven't had Skittles in like forever,,29:48.0,29:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,SD
10589,3,2,S2 ,,me neither,29:52.0,29:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10590,3,2,S2 ,huh that is somewhat weird,,29:54.0,30:05.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
10591,3,2,S2 ,on the back it says a blue one is blue raspberry,,30:07.0,30:17.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10592,3,2,S2 ,but it doesn't say like blue raspberry,,30:17.0,30:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10593,3,2,S2 ,it just says raspberry,,30:19.0,30:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10594,3,2,S2 ,,okay so you know what like those marshmallow Peeps are right,30:20.0,30:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,QE,
10595,3,2,S2 ,mm-hmm,,30:22.0,30:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10596,3,2,S2 ,,so my mom just buy pause filler Peeps,30:25.0,30:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10597,3,2,S2 ,,but they're blue raspberry flavored,30:28.0,30:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10598,3,2,S2 ,,and it was really weird,30:31.0,30:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10599,3,2,S2 ,it sounds weird,,30:34.0,30:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10600,3,2,S2 ,I should've known they're flavored Peeps,,30:35.0,30:41.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10601,3,2,S2 ,I thought they were just marshmallow flavored,,30:41.0,30:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10602,3,2,S2 ,,me too (laughter),30:43.0,30:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

10621,3,2,S2 ,I don't know,,32:52.0,32:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10622,3,2,S2 ,maybe I'm thinking maybe I'd be like a computer scientist or something like that-ish,,32:53.0,33:01.0,00:08.0,,,,,,SD
10623,3,2,S2 ,you know I like computers,,33:01.0,33:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,SD
10624,3,2,S2 ,,that's cool,33:03.0,33:04.0,00:01.0,,,LP,,,

10634,3,2,S2 ,you don't really because you know pause filler this school it's like has a really good computer science and theater thing,,33:30.0,33:38.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10635,3,2,S2 ,which is sort of a weird combination,,33:38.0,33:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10636,3,2,S2 ,,yeah,33:40.0,33:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

10638,3,2,S2 ,let's see,,33:51.0,33:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10639,3,2,S2 ,the red ones are okay,,33:53.0,33:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

10644,3,2,S2 ,I like the purple ones they're the best,,34:20.0,34:37.0,00:17.0,,,,,,SD
10645,3,2,S2 ,,all of these kind of remind me of a holiday,34:37.0,34:56.0,00:19.0,,,,,SD,

10647,3,2,S2 ,,I know it's kind of weird to say,34:59.0,35:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10648,3,2,S2 ,,but the blue ones kind of remind me of Easter,35:00.0,35:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,SD,
10649,3,2,S2 ,,and the red ones remind me of the Valentine's day just like the taste,35:02.0,35:09.0,00:07.0,,,,,SD,
10650,3,2,S2 ,,and the purple ones remind me Christmas,35:11.0,35:19.0,00:08.0,,,,,SD,
10651,3,2,S2 ,the purple ones feel sort of summery,,35:19.0,35:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10652,3,2,S2 ,I (inaudible) the purple ones would have to taste like the fourth of July,,35:23.0,35:41.0,00:18.0,,,,,SD,
10653,3,2,S2 ,huh,,35:46.0,35:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10654,3,2,S2 ,yes,,35:47.0,35:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10655,3,2,S2 ,,all right so first you're going to,36:01.0,36:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10656,3,2,T2 ,,,36:03.0,56:39.0,20:36.0,,,,,,
10657,3,2,T2 ,one second I don't have that thing up,,36:04.0,36:11.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10658,3,2,T2 ,are you in Chrome,,36:11.0,36:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10659,3,2,T2 ,is that it,,36:13.0,36:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10660,3,2,T2 ,are you in Chrome for the browser,,36:14.0,36:24.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10661,3,2,T2 ,,pause filler I'm not sure,36:26.0,36:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10662,3,2,T2 ,one sec,,36:29.0,36:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10663,3,2,T2 ,oh yeah you are,,36:31.0,36:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10664,3,2,T2 ,but one second let me open up,,36:32.0,36:39.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10665,3,2,T2 ,so you're on,,36:39.0,36:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10666,3,2,T2 ,,where did the pen go,36:40.0,36:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10667,3,2,T2 ,,what the heck,36:43.0,36:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10668,3,2,T2 ,is your thing set up as one over x equals twenty-five,,36:45.0,36:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10669,3,2,T2 ,,yes,36:50.0,36:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10670,3,2,T2 ,okay,,36:51.0,36:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10671,3,2,T2 ,,oh my gosh,36:51.0,36:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10672,3,2,T2 ,,where did the pen go,36:53.0,36:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10673,3,2,T2 ,,I swear I'm going insane,36:57.0,37:20.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
10674,3,2,T2 ,,one second,37:25.0,37:31.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10675,3,2,T2 ,did you find it,,37:38.0,37:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10676,3,2,T2 ,,yeah,37:46.0,37:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10677,3,2,T2 ,what was it,,37:47.0,37:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10678,3,2,T2 ,,he had the pen,37:49.0,37:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10679,3,2,T2 ,,he certainly grabbed it,37:51.0,37:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10680,3,2,T2 ,,,37:55.0,39:44.0,01:49.0,,,,,,
10681,3,2,T2 ,,all right so now do you know how to do this,37:55.0,38:02.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10682,3,2,T2 ,,we're going to start off by multiplying by x on both sides,38:02.0,38:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10683,3,2,T2 ,okay so you multiply it by x on the (inaudible),,38:06.0,38:13.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10684,3,2,T2 ,,well actually never mind,38:13.0,38:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10685,3,2,T2 ,,that was wrong,38:18.0,38:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10686,3,2,T2 ,,wait I'm looking at the tutor worksheet,38:18.0,38:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10687,3,2,T2 ,,yeah you do multiply both sides by x okay,38:34.0,38:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10688,3,2,T2 ,okay so and so you multiply that by x,,38:36.0,38:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10689,3,2,T2 ,then you get one x over x,,38:43.0,38:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10690,3,2,T2 ,so that could be one,,38:47.0,38:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10691,3,2,T2 ,,oh yeah that would just be one no x on this side,38:49.0,38:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10692,3,2,T2 ,,after you multiply on this side,38:52.0,38:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10693,3,2,T2 ,,after you multiply it by x,38:53.0,38:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10694,3,2,T2 ,,it pause filler it cancels out the x,38:55.0,38:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10695,3,2,T2 ,,so then that would be twenty-five x,38:57.0,39:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10696,3,2,T2 ,yeah so then you divide it by twenty-five on both sides,,39:00.0,39:07.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10697,3,2,T2 ,okay,,39:08.0,39:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10698,3,2,T2 ,okay so then you have x equals one over twenty-five,,39:16.0,39:22.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10699,3,2,T2 ,,all right oh you all right okay,39:26.0,39:44.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
10700,3,2,T2 ,,,39:44.0,40:58.0,01:14.0,,,,,,
10701,3,2,T2 ,,so you want to start off by adding seventeen,39:44.0,39:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10702,3,2,T2 ,,now what do you do next,39:48.0,39:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10703,3,2,T2 ,,you add a number to the sides,39:49.0,39:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10704,3,2,T2 ,okay pause filler okay yeah it makes sense,,39:52.0,39:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10705,3,2,T2 ,so you just add the seventeen,,39:54.0,39:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10706,3,2,T2 ,and then you would get eighty,,40:00.0,40:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10707,3,2,T2 ,,yeah so negative three over y equals eighty,40:03.0,40:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10708,3,2,T2 ,,now you want to multiply it by y on both sides,40:12.0,40:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10709,3,2,T2 ,okay so one pause filler negative three equals eighty-y,,40:15.0,40:25.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10710,3,2,T2 ,this you would want to divide it by y,,40:26.0,40:31.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10711,3,2,T2 ,no you would want to divide it by,,40:31.0,40:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10712,3,2,T2 ,no you would want to divide by,,40:37.0,40:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10713,3,2,T2 ,,eighty,40:39.0,40:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10714,3,2,T2 ,eighty,,40:39.0,40:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10715,3,2,T2 ,so then you would get y equals negative three over eighty,,40:40.0,40:53.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
10716,3,2,T2 ,that must be okay that was this is beautiful okay,,40:54.0,40:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10717,3,2,T2 ,,,40:58.0,42:09.0,01:11.0,,,,,,
10718,3,2,T2 ,okay next,,40:58.0,41:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10719,3,2,T2 ,,all right so two hundred ten equals negative fourteen over y,41:03.0,41:10.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10720,3,2,T2 ,,what do you think your first step is going to be,41:10.0,41:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10721,3,2,T2 ,pause filler so you multiply it by y yeah,,41:13.0,41:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10722,3,2,T2 ,,so that cancels that out on this side,41:16.0,41:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10723,3,2,T2 ,,and then you can equal two hundred ten,41:20.0,41:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10724,3,2,T2 ,so you got negative yes,,41:23.0,41:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10725,3,2,T2 ,and then you get two hundred and ten y equals negative fourteen,,41:24.0,41:33.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10726,3,2,T2 ,okay so after you do that you pause filler want to divide everything by twenty-five,,41:34.0,41:44.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10727,3,2,T2 ,,yeah so you're left with y on one side,41:44.0,41:53.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10728,3,2,T2 ,,because the two hundred ten is canceled out,41:55.0,42:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10729,3,2,T2 ,mm-hmm and (inaudible) you're both uh-huh with seven (inaudible),,42:00.0,42:08.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10730,3,2,T2 ,that looks good,,42:08.0,42:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10731,3,2,T2 ,okay so because this one,,42:09.0,42:17.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10732,3,2,T2 ,,,42:09.0,43:31.0,01:22.0,,,,,,
10733,3,2,T2 ,,you want to start off by adding twenty-four to both sides,42:17.0,42:26.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10734,3,2,T2 ,and then oh one hundred thirty-seven equals five over x,,42:26.0,42:41.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
10735,3,2,T2 ,and then like the other ones you would want to multiply it by x,,42:41.0,42:51.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10736,3,2,T2 ,,correct,42:51.0,42:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10737,3,2,T2 ,and one hundred thirty-seven x equals five divided by hundred thirty-seven,,42:55.0,43:11.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
10738,3,2,T2 ,,perfect,43:12.0,43:12.0,00:00.0,,,UL,,,
10739,3,2,T2 ,yup x equals pause filler one hundred thirty-seven yeah,,43:12.0,43:27.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
10740,3,2,T2 ,,you got it,43:27.0,43:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10741,3,2,T2 ,yeah okay pause filler,,43:30.0,43:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10742,3,2,T2 ,next one,,43:31.0,43:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10743,3,2,T2 ,,,43:31.0,45:17.0,01:46.0,,,,,,
10744,3,2,T2 ,,yup,43:33.0,43:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10745,3,2,T2 ,pause filler yeah,,43:36.0,43:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10746,3,2,T2 ,,all right oh so this is different,43:37.0,43:43.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10747,3,2,T2 ,yeah,,43:43.0,43:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10748,3,2,T2 ,,so you negative thirty-nine is smaller,43:44.0,43:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10749,3,2,T2 ,,so you probably want to start off by adding thirty-nine to both sides,43:47.0,43:57.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10750,3,2,T2 ,pause filler well yeah it makes sense,,43:57.0,43:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10751,3,2,T2 ,,so remember that seventeen over x and twelve over x are like terms,44:05.0,44:11.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10752,3,2,T2 ,,so you probably want to subtract twelve x from both sides,44:11.0,44:18.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10753,3,2,T2 ,yeah okay one second,,44:19.0,44:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10754,3,2,T2 ,let me just get this up,,44:21.0,44:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10755,3,2,T2 ,equals twelve x or soon not to be twelve x,,44:23.0,44:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10756,3,2,T2 ,oh it's twenty-one (inaudible) eighteen eighteen,,44:28.0,44:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10757,3,2,T2 ,we can subtract that to get pause filler five over x equals eighteen,,44:34.0,44:46.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
10758,3,2,T2 ,,all right yup,44:46.0,44:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10759,3,2,T2 ,multiply it by x to get five pause filler equals eighteen x,,44:47.0,44:57.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10760,3,2,T2 ,and we can divide by eighteen to get on with over here pause filler,,44:57.0,45:05.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10761,3,2,T2 ,five over eighteen equals x,,45:07.0,45:11.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10762,3,2,T2 ,that's so sloppy,,45:11.0,45:17.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10763,3,2,T2 ,and x,,45:17.0,45:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10764,3,2,T2 ,,all right so this one is very similar,45:18.0,45:26.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10765,3,2,T2 ,,,45:18.0,49:59.0,04:41.0,,,,,,
10766,3,2,T2 ,,so negative nine and two are smaller,45:26.0,45:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10767,3,2,T2 ,,so what would you do with that,45:29.0,45:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10768,3,2,T2 ,pause filler so you would want to you want to add it,,45:32.0,45:39.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10769,3,2,T2 ,and you get plus another ninety-two,,45:39.0,45:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10770,3,2,T2 ,okay pause filler then you have three x equals pause filler a hundred and three plus twelve x,,45:46.0,46:01.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
10771,3,2,T2 ,and then you want to subtract with twelve x,,46:01.0,46:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10772,3,2,T2 ,get rid of that until (inaudible),,46:05.0,46:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10773,3,2,T2 ,,well twelve over x remember,46:07.0,46:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10774,3,2,T2 ,oh yeah (laughter),,46:09.0,46:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10775,3,2,T2 ,,but it's okay you still subtract,46:11.0,46:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10776,3,2,T2 ,here,,46:14.0,46:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10777,3,2,T2 ,,but you should subtract pause filler three x right three over x first,46:14.0,46:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10778,3,2,T2 ,you did that one,,46:20.0,46:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10779,3,2,T2 ,it could be a zero equals a hundred three plus fifteen x,,46:21.0,46:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10780,3,2,T2 ,,no because if you're subtracting pause filler three over x on from twelve,46:27.0,46:34.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10781,3,2,T2 ,,then it would be pause filler nine over x like one hundred three,46:35.0,46:41.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10782,3,2,T2 ,pause filler yeah one second yeah,,46:41.0,46:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10783,3,2,T2 ,,oh well actually right you're right sorry,46:45.0,46:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10784,3,2,T2 ,okay,,46:48.0,46:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10785,3,2,T2 ,,so you would subtract twelve x,46:49.0,46:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10786,3,2,T2 ,,because three x is on the other equal side of the,46:50.0,46:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10787,3,2,T2 ,okay so minus twelve x,,46:53.0,46:59.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10788,3,2,T2 ,yeah that's a beautiful x (laughter),,46:59.0,47:08.0,00:09.0,,,,LPP,,
10789,3,2,T2 ,so then you know being negative nine yeah negative yeah twelve over x,,47:08.0,47:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10790,3,2,T2 ,and we got negative nine x equals a hundred and three,,47:15.0,47:22.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10791,3,2,T2 ,that makes sense,,47:25.0,47:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10792,3,2,T2 ,okay and then,,47:28.0,47:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10793,3,2,T2 ,,you divide by well you said you multiply I mean,47:30.0,47:43.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
10794,3,2,T2 ,I guess you could divide right pause filler maybe,,47:44.0,47:58.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
10795,3,2,T2 ,I think you could divide but pause filler multiply okay pause filler,,47:58.0,48:05.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10796,3,2,T2 ,x wait no nine equals,,48:06.0,48:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10797,3,2,T2 ,,how do you get your screen to go lower,48:11.0,48:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10798,3,2,T2 ,,because I can't see what you're doing,48:13.0,48:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10799,3,2,T2 ,pause filler you can't pause filler,,48:15.0,48:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10800,3,2,T2 ,see how far can you see to what I'm doing,,48:16.0,48:23.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10801,3,2,T2 ,,I can see,48:24.0,48:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10802,3,2,T2 ,here I'm going to write a bunch of numbers,,48:26.0,48:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10803,3,2,T2 ,tell me which ones you can see,,48:30.0,48:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10804,3,2,T2 ,can you see any of those,,48:31.0,48:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10805,3,2,T2 ,,I can see one two three and four,48:33.0,48:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10806,3,2,T2 ,okay so you can't see five and six pause filler,,48:35.0,48:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10807,3,2,T2 ,okay now I'll get rid of those pause filler okay pause filler,,48:37.0,48:43.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10808,3,2,T2 ,huh is your pause filler scribbler screen like fully like,,48:44.0,48:52.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10809,3,2,T2 ,is it from like one end to the screen all the way up to the other,,48:52.0,48:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10810,3,2,T2 ,,well it is now because I've just made it bigger but it's,48:57.0,49:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10811,3,2,T2 ,can you see nine equals one hundred threex,,49:02.0,49:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10812,3,2,T2 ,,pause filler yes I wait it's okay,49:06.0,49:13.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10813,3,2,T2 ,,just keep working,49:13.0,49:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10814,3,2,T2 ,,I can fix it,49:13.0,49:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10815,3,2,T2 ,,just keep working,49:17.0,49:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10816,3,2,T2 ,,it's okay,49:18.0,49:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10817,3,2,T2 ,pause filler ops one second I think pause filler oh actually a way to scroll down,,49:19.0,49:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10818,3,2,T2 ,you can just probably use a scroll button pause filler,,49:24.0,49:29.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10819,3,2,T2 ,no that one,,49:29.0,49:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10820,3,2,T2 ,like okay yeah okay pause filler yeah,,49:31.0,49:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10821,3,2,T2 ,I'll just try and go with it,,49:32.0,49:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10822,3,2,T2 ,so then I go pause filler one hundred and three x oh (laughter) pause filler,,49:35.0,49:43.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10823,3,2,T2 ,yes you divide a hundred and three,,49:43.0,49:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10824,3,2,T2 ,so you got nine over a hundred and three equals x,,49:46.0,49:53.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10825,3,2,T2 ,there we go okay,,49:53.0,49:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10826,3,2,T2 ,,,49:59.0,53:15.0,03:16.0,,,,,,
10827,3,2,T2 ,and next one,,49:59.0,50:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10828,3,2,T2 ,,all right so twenty-five is smaller,50:03.0,50:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10829,3,2,T2 ,,so you want to start up by subtracting that from both sides right,50:07.0,50:24.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
10830,3,2,T2 ,yea,,50:11.0,50:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10831,3,2,T2 ,pause filler yeah,,50:24.0,50:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10832,3,2,T2 ,come on (laughter),,50:24.0,50:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10833,3,2,T2 ,that's sort of like I just want to know what that looks like,,50:25.0,50:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10834,3,2,T2 ,then got one over x no wait and then that will be plus thirty-five equals nine over x,,50:30.0,50:47.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
10835,3,2,T2 ,and then since you have that already,,50:50.0,50:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10836,3,2,T2 ,you want to get rid of the one over x,,50:55.0,50:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10837,3,2,T2 ,and it's just the bottoms all (inaudible) is,,50:59.0,51:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10838,3,2,T2 ,you can just subtract that,,51:01.0,51:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10839,3,2,T2 ,,yes so you subtract one over x on both sides,51:02.0,51:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10840,3,2,T2 ,,and then you would end up with,51:05.0,51:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10841,3,2,T2 ,thirty-five equals eight overx,,51:07.0,51:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10842,3,2,T2 ,,so then you would want to multiply it by x on both sides to cancel out the x on this side,51:10.0,51:21.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
10843,3,2,T2 ,well I was thinking pause filler since pause filler since the wait,,51:21.0,51:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10844,3,2,T2 ,you could try dividing by eight,,51:25.0,51:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10845,3,2,T2 ,do you think that would work,,51:27.0,51:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10846,3,2,T2 ,,well on my tutor sheet it doesn't say anything about dividing by eight so,51:30.0,51:38.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10847,3,2,T2 ,,I think you would just I think that it would just pause filler give you extra steps that you don't plan,51:39.0,51:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10848,3,2,T2 ,well maybe well I guess if you multiply if you divide it by eight when you just have x right x by itself,,51:45.0,51:52.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10849,3,2,T2 ,,no because it's dividing anyway,51:54.0,51:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10850,3,2,T2 ,,like eight it is divided by x anyway so pause filler,51:56.0,51:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10851,3,2,T2 ,,you would have to multiply it or something,51:59.0,52:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10852,3,2,T2 ,,but it just it's pause filler,52:02.0,52:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10853,3,2,T2 ,okay,,52:06.0,52:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10854,3,2,T2 ,,it would be too complicated I guess,52:07.0,52:13.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10855,3,2,T2 ,,on all of the things it says to,52:13.0,52:19.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10856,3,2,T2 ,okay,,52:21.0,52:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10857,3,2,T2 ,wait so then you get thirty-five x equals eight,,52:21.0,52:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10858,3,2,T2 ,or so we just divide it by thirty-five,,52:27.0,52:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10859,3,2,T2 ,and you get x equals like could you see that stuff on the bottom I was doing,,52:31.0,52:41.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10860,3,2,T2 ,,pause filler no I couldn't,52:41.0,52:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10861,3,2,T2 ,,but I can see what you're doing right now,52:42.0,52:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10862,3,2,T2 ,okay x equals eight over thirty-five pause filler,,52:44.0,52:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10863,3,2,T2 ,but on this problem could you just draw a line at the bottom of the page that where you can see,,52:50.0,52:58.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10864,3,2,T2 ,,yeah,52:58.0,52:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10865,3,2,T2 ,okay that way,,53:02.0,53:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10866,3,2,T2 ,,all right wait,53:04.0,53:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10867,3,2,T2 ,okay pause filler,,53:05.0,53:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10868,3,2,T2 ,okay so you can see all the stuff,,53:09.0,53:15.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10869,3,2,T2 ,,,53:15.0,56:05.0,02:50.0,,,,,,
10870,3,2,T2 ,,all right so you're going to start off by subtracting twenty-two,53:16.0,53:22.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10871,3,2,T2 ,and then you get a hundred and three,,53:23.0,53:30.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10872,3,2,T2 ,,yup,53:32.0,53:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10873,3,2,T2 ,plus ten x and then ninex,,53:32.0,53:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10874,3,2,T2 ,,okay,53:37.0,53:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10875,3,2,T2 ,and then pause filler yeah you're going to get rid of the tenx,,53:38.0,53:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10876,3,2,T2 ,,so you probably want to subtract,53:46.0,53:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10877,3,2,T2 ,yeah so then you get a hundred three equals pause filler negative onex,,53:49.0,54:11.0,00:22.0,,,,,,
10878,3,2,T2 ,,all right so then you want to multiply,54:11.0,54:33.0,00:22.0,,,,,,
10879,3,2,T2 ,I was just trying something out,,54:33.0,54:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10880,3,2,T2 ,because if you multiply that by negative one x,,54:35.0,54:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10881,3,2,T2 ,and then it would be negative one right over negative one x right,,54:42.0,54:49.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10882,3,2,T2 ,and then you could cancel out the negative one,,54:51.0,54:56.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10883,3,2,T2 ,,well if you see look at number nine on here,54:56.0,55:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10884,3,2,T2 ,,this is like a really similar problem,55:01.0,55:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10885,3,2,T2 ,,and you can kind of see what they're doing,55:04.0,55:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10886,3,2,T2 ,,it's not really like,55:06.0,55:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10887,3,2,T2 ,oh yes I mean it just seems like you would get rid of the step,,55:10.0,55:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10888,3,2,T2 ,but really it's just do those stuff,,55:13.0,55:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10889,3,2,T2 ,so you want to multiply by the x hundred and three,,55:16.0,55:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10890,3,2,T2 ,and you get x equals one over (inaudible),,55:19.0,55:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10891,3,2,T2 ,wait okay pause filler,,55:24.0,55:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10892,3,2,T2 ,,well you still have to divide it by negative one,55:25.0,55:39.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
10893,3,2,T2 ,,so you multiply that on both sides and then pause filler,55:41.0,55:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10894,3,2,T2 ,yeah actually you divide it,,55:50.0,55:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10895,3,2,T2 ,then the step would be on the other side to just divide,,55:51.0,55:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10896,3,2,T2 ,you get x by itself,,55:55.0,55:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10897,3,2,T2 ,and you have to divide negative three by negative one,,55:56.0,55:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10898,3,2,T2 ,,okay all right,55:59.0,56:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10899,3,2,T2 ,pause filler but is that the same thing,,56:00.0,56:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10900,3,2,T2 ,I don't think so pause filler,,56:03.0,56:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10901,3,2,T2 ,,I doubt it,56:04.0,56:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10902,3,2,T2 ,okay,,56:04.0,56:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10903,3,2,T2 ,,,56:05.0,56:39.0,00:34.0,,,,,,
10904,3,2,T2 ,,all right so let's pause filler one ninety,56:05.0,56:14.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10905,3,2,T2 ,,what's ninety what's one ninety there we go yeah,56:16.0,56:26.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10906,3,2,T2 ,,and then I would want to yeah,56:26.0,56:31.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10907,3,2,T2 ,,oh this is a big number pause filler,56:31.0,56:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10908,3,2,T2 ,,so you got negative five over x equals,56:33.0,56:41.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10909,3,2,T2 ,okay,,56:47.0,56:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10910,3,2,T2 ,it's like really tiny,,56:50.0,56:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10911,3,2,T2 ,I don't know,,56:51.0,56:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10912,3,2,T2 ,I don't know what happened to it,,56:53.0,56:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10913,3,2,T2 ,,all right,57:05.0,57:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10914,3,2,T2 ,okay,,57:11.0,57:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10915,3,2,T2 ,bye,,57:16.0,57:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10916,3,2,T2 ,,all right,57:16.0,57:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10917,3,2,T2 ,okay bye,,57:19.0,57:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10918,3,2,T2 ,,bye,57:19.0,57:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10919,3,2,T2 ,bye,,57:19.0,57:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10920,4,1,S1 ,,,00:41.0,08:17.0,07:36.0,,,,,,
10921,4,1,S1 ,what,,02:48.0,02:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10922,4,1,S1 ,,okay,07:54.0,07:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10923,4,1,S1 ,,all right,08:02.0,08:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10924,4,1,S1 ,(inaudible),,08:19.0,08:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10925,4,1,S1 ,so there's one on every page,,10:06.0,10:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10926,4,1,S1 ,so I just go to there to go to the next problem,,10:09.0,10:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10927,4,1,S1 ,and they work they do the problem,,10:12.0,10:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10928,4,1,T1 ,,,10:33.0,20:55.0,10:22.0,,,,,,
10929,4,1,T1 ,,,10:34.0,12:48.0,02:14.0,,,,,,
10930,4,1,T1 ,pause filler you can start,,11:23.0,11:46.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
10931,4,1,T1 ,,okay so pause filler all right this thing's weird to control pause filler,11:46.0,12:01.0,00:15.0,,SV,,,,
10932,4,1,T1 ,,so is this how pause filler to start the equation,12:25.0,12:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10933,4,1,T1 ,pause filler yeah so then the sixes cancel out,,12:30.0,12:40.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10934,4,1,T1 ,,yeah,12:40.0,12:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10935,4,1,T1 ,and then you add thirteen to six,,12:41.0,12:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10936,4,1,T1 ,,yeah okay so you get x equals pause filler nineteen,12:43.0,12:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10937,4,1,T1 ,pause filler,,12:47.0,12:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10938,4,1,T1 ,,,12:48.0,13:33.0,00:45.0,,,,,,
10939,4,1,T1 ,,all right so fifteen equals negative eight plus p,12:48.0,12:58.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
10940,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler so you have fifteen,12:58.0,13:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10941,4,1,T1 ,,and then you add eight,13:03.0,13:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10942,4,1,T1 ,,because you undo the eights correct okay,13:04.0,13:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10943,4,1,T1 ,yeah,,13:08.0,13:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10944,4,1,T1 ,,eight and so the eights cancel out,13:09.0,13:23.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
10945,4,1,T1 ,,and then you get fifteen plus eight,13:23.0,13:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10946,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler you get twenty-three,13:25.0,13:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10947,4,1,T1 ,yeah,,13:32.0,13:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10948,4,1,T1 ,,equals p okay all right so this problem works the same as everything else,13:32.0,13:45.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
10949,4,1,T1 ,,,13:33.0,14:07.0,00:34.0,,,,,,
10950,4,1,T1 ,pause filler yeah,,13:45.0,13:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10951,4,1,T1 ,,okay so you use thirteen minus eleven,13:46.0,13:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10952,4,1,T1 ,,seventeen minus eleven is six equals k,14:01.0,14:06.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10953,4,1,T1 ,,,14:16.0,15:07.0,00:51.0,,,,,,
10954,4,1,T1 ,,so for this problem you would divide out the forty-four,14:16.0,14:21.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10955,4,1,T1 ,yeah,,14:21.0,14:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10956,4,1,T1 ,,okay pause filler two twenty divided by forty-four is pause filler forty-five,14:21.0,14:55.0,00:34.0,,,,,,
10957,4,1,T1 ,,so I have five,14:56.0,15:02.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10958,4,1,T1 ,,because twenty two hundred twenty divided by forty-four is five,15:02.0,15:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10959,4,1,T1 ,yeah,,15:07.0,15:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10960,4,1,T1 ,,,15:11.0,16:16.0,01:05.0,,,,,,
10961,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler negative nine plus thirteen p it pause filler fifty,15:12.0,15:48.0,00:36.0,,,,,,
10962,4,1,T1 ,fifty,,15:48.0,15:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10963,4,1,T1 ,,yeah so p equals fifty thirteenths pause filler four (inaudible) almost done (inaudible),15:49.0,16:16.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
10964,4,1,T1 ,,,16:23.0,16:39.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
10965,4,1,T1 ,,twenty twenty-four over six over six equals pause filler four okay,16:23.0,16:39.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
10966,4,1,T1 ,,,16:49.0,17:56.0,01:07.0,,,,,,
10967,4,1,T1 ,,forty plus (inaudible) forty plus twenty-two is sixty-two,16:49.0,17:14.0,00:25.0,,,,,,
10968,4,1,T1 ,pause filler,,17:12.0,17:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10969,4,1,T1 ,,equals pause filler yeah sixty-two fifteenths equals k (inaudible) twenty yeah,17:15.0,17:56.0,00:41.0,,,,,,
10970,4,1,T1 ,,,17:56.0,18:16.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
10971,4,1,T1 ,yeah that's right,,18:14.0,18:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10972,4,1,T1 ,,okay so they pretty much follow the same rules of just going,18:16.0,18:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10973,4,1,T1 ,,,18:16.0,19:38.0,01:22.0,,,,,,
10974,4,1,T1 ,yeah,,18:20.0,18:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10975,4,1,T1 ,,yeah all right so,18:21.0,18:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
10976,4,1,T1 ,okay so what you do is you subtract this p,,18:28.0,18:35.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10977,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler okay,18:35.0,18:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10978,4,1,T1 ,pause filler from this p,,18:36.0,18:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10979,4,1,T1 ,,okay so you want all the variables on one side,18:38.0,18:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
10980,4,1,T1 ,,and then you get the equation,18:40.0,18:54.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
10981,4,1,T1 ,yeah,,18:57.0,18:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10982,4,1,T1 ,,twelve pause filler nope (inaudible) so you get fifteen equals four p,19:00.0,19:13.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
10983,4,1,T1 ,one two p because you're subtracting,,19:13.0,19:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10984,4,1,T1 ,,oh okay thank you (inaudible) twelve pause filler three because you subtract twelve,19:18.0,19:27.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
10985,4,1,T1 ,,and then you get three equals two p or one-point-five equals p,19:28.0,19:36.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
10986,4,1,T1 ,yup,,19:37.0,19:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10987,4,1,T1 ,,,19:42.0,20:26.0,00:44.0,,,,,,
10988,4,1,T1 ,,you get pause filler k,19:43.0,19:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
10989,4,1,T1 ,,you'd subtract the k to get seven k,19:44.0,19:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
10990,4,1,T1 ,no,,19:50.0,19:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10991,4,1,T1 ,,right,19:51.0,19:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10992,4,1,T1 ,this the eight k would become the seven k,,19:51.0,19:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10993,4,1,T1 ,,yeah and that equals ten,19:54.0,19:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10994,4,1,T1 ,yeah,,19:58.0,19:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
10995,4,1,T1 ,,negative ten negative ten because there's a subtraction sign there,19:58.0,20:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10996,4,1,T1 ,,then you add the sixty-eight to get,20:01.0,20:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
10997,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler seven k equals seventy-eight,20:05.0,20:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
10998,4,1,T1 ,,and then you get k equals pause filler seventy-eight sevenths,20:11.0,20:18.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
10999,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler that may or may not be reducible,20:20.0,20:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11000,4,1,T1 ,,but that is the answer,20:23.0,20:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11001,4,1,T1 ,yeah,,20:25.0,20:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11002,4,1,T1 ,,okay pause filler do you have any idea where they are,20:30.0,20:38.0,00:08.0,,SV,,,,
11003,4,1,T1 ,nope,,20:39.0,20:39.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
11004,4,1,T1 ,,okay then pause filler they're somewhere near where I am,20:40.0,20:50.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
11005,4,1,T1 ,,what,21:19.0,21:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11006,4,1,T1 ,,okay,21:25.0,21:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11007,4,1,T1 ,,okay,21:28.0,21:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11008,4,1,T1 ,,okay,21:30.0,21:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11009,4,1,T1 ,yeah,,21:33.0,21:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11010,4,1,T1 ,yeah,,21:43.0,21:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11011,4,1,T1 ,,,21:45.0,29:37.0,07:52.0,,,,,,
11012,4,1,T1 ,,,21:45.0,22:24.0,00:39.0,,,,,,
11013,4,1,T1 ,,all right so you have pause filler,21:45.0,21:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11014,4,1,T1 ,,you subtract the r,21:48.0,21:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11015,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler so you're left with one r,21:51.0,21:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11016,4,1,T1 ,,so you get negative thirty-three equals pause filler r minus fifteen,21:53.0,22:01.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
11017,4,1,T1 ,,you add fifteen to both sides,22:01.0,22:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11018,4,1,T1 ,,so you get pause filler negative thirty-three plus fifteen is negative twenty pause filler eighteen,22:05.0,22:17.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
11019,4,1,T1 ,,you have eighteen,22:17.0,22:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11020,4,1,T1 ,pause filler yes,,22:21.0,22:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11021,4,1,T1 ,,okay so yeah negative eighteen equals r,22:22.0,22:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11022,4,1,T1 ,,,22:28.0,23:26.0,00:58.0,,,,,,
11023,4,1,T1 ,okay so it's the same thing,,22:28.0,22:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11024,4,1,T1 ,,yeah okay so you subtract u,22:35.0,22:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11025,4,1,T1 ,,and you get negative forty-two equals eight plus three u,22:38.0,22:48.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
11026,4,1,T1 ,,and then you get equals then you get,22:48.0,22:54.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11027,4,1,T1 ,,then you subtract the eight,22:54.0,22:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11028,4,1,T1 ,,so you get negative fifty,22:57.0,23:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11029,4,1,T1 ,,fifty equals three u,23:01.0,23:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11030,4,1,T1 ,,and you get pause filler,23:05.0,23:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11031,4,1,T1 ,,you divide by three,23:07.0,23:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11032,4,1,T1 ,,and you get negative fifty thirds equals u okay pause filler just larger numbers (laughs) all right,23:09.0,23:26.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
11033,4,1,T1 ,,,23:26.0,24:01.0,00:35.0,,,,,,
11034,4,1,T1 ,,so you subtract the n,23:26.0,23:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11035,4,1,T1 ,,you get ninety-nine n,23:27.0,23:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11036,4,1,T1 ,,so you get one hundred six equals pause filler ninety-nine n plus seven n seven,23:29.0,23:40.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
11037,4,1,T1 ,,and you subtract seven,23:41.0,23:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11038,4,1,T1 ,,and you get ninety-nine n equals ninety nine,23:43.0,23:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11039,4,1,T1 ,,so you get n equals one one all right pause filler,23:51.0,24:01.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
11040,4,1,T1 ,,,24:01.0,24:41.0,00:40.0,,,,,,
11041,4,1,T1 ,,okay so subtract g,24:01.0,24:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11042,4,1,T1 ,,subtract g,24:06.0,24:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11043,4,1,T1 ,,you get fifty-five equals seven plus twelve g,24:07.0,24:16.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
11044,4,1,T1 ,pause filler,,24:15.0,24:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11045,4,1,T1 ,,because you're subtracting,24:16.0,24:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11046,4,1,T1 ,,and then pause filler you subtract the seven,24:18.0,24:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11047,4,1,T1 ,,you get get rid of that pause filler,24:23.0,24:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11048,4,1,T1 ,,fifty-five minus seven is forty-eight equals twelve g,24:28.0,24:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11049,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler you divide by twelve,24:33.0,24:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11050,4,1,T1 ,,you get four equals g,24:37.0,24:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11051,4,1,T1 ,,,24:42.0,25:30.0,00:48.0,,,,,,
11052,4,1,T1 ,good,,24:42.0,24:42.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11053,4,1,T1 ,,okay negative eleven plus y equals twenty-four plus eight y,24:42.0,24:49.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
11054,4,1,T1 ,,subtract y good enough,24:49.0,24:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11055,4,1,T1 ,,negative eleven equals pause filler twenty-four pause filler plus plus seven y,24:55.0,25:05.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
11056,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler you subtract the twenty-four,25:05.0,25:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11057,4,1,T1 ,,you get negative thirty-five equals seven y,25:10.0,25:16.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11058,4,1,T1 ,,and so you divide,25:19.0,25:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11059,4,1,T1 ,,you get pause filler seven,25:20.0,25:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11060,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler you get negative negative five (inaudible) equals pause filler yeah y,25:22.0,25:30.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
11061,4,1,T1 ,,there we go okay so pause filler,25:30.0,25:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11062,4,1,T1 ,,,25:30.0,27:02.0,01:32.0,,,,,,
11063,4,1,T1 ,,it's just the same principle,25:33.0,25:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11064,4,1,T1 ,,you subtract all the ds,25:37.0,25:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11065,4,1,T1 ,,you subtract them,25:40.0,25:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11066,4,1,T1 ,you could do the,,25:41.0,25:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11067,4,1,T1 ,if you do the twenty-eight if you subtract the twenty-eight then you'll end up with a positive d,,25:43.0,25:53.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
11068,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler yeah it would be,25:53.0,25:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11069,4,1,T1 ,,it would be a nicer number,25:54.0,25:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11070,4,1,T1 ,,so you subtract the twenty-eight,25:55.0,25:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11071,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler you get fifty-three minus twenty-eight which is pause filler fifty minus twenty-five,25:57.0,26:04.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
11072,4,1,T1 ,,so you have twenty-five d plus seventy equals equals nineteen,26:05.0,26:15.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
11073,4,1,T1 ,,subtract seventy seventy,26:16.0,26:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11074,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler you subtract the seventy,26:19.0,26:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11075,4,1,T1 ,,you get twenty-five,26:23.0,26:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11076,4,1,T1 ,,twenty-five equals pause filler nineteen minus seventy is pause filler nine minus sixty is fifty-one,26:27.0,26:40.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
11077,4,1,T1 ,,negative fifty-one that seems about,26:40.0,26:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11078,4,1,T1 ,yes,,26:44.0,26:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11079,4,1,T1 ,,that seems about right,26:45.0,26:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11080,4,1,T1 ,,you divide by twenty-five forgot the variable there,26:46.0,26:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11081,4,1,T1 ,,you get d equals pause filler fifty-one twenty-fifths okay,26:50.0,27:02.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
11082,4,1,T1 ,,,27:04.0,27:54.0,00:50.0,,,,,,
11083,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler it's probably easier to do if you subtract the nine,27:04.0,27:10.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11084,4,1,T1 ,(sfx),,27:06.0,27:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11085,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler x nine x there we go,27:10.0,27:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11086,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler you subtract the nine x,27:14.0,27:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11087,4,1,T1 ,,you get one hundred two equals fifty-three pause filler plus ten x pause filler so,27:15.0,27:29.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
11088,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler one hundred two minus fifty-three is fifty-two minus three is forty-nine equals ten x,27:29.0,27:40.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
11089,4,1,T1 ,,so you get pause filler forty four-point-nine equals x okay pause filler thirteen y plus twenty-seven pause filler,27:40.0,27:54.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
11090,4,1,T1 ,,it's easier to just subtract that y,27:54.0,27:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11091,4,1,T1 ,,,27:54.0,28:46.0,00:52.0,,,,,,
11092,4,1,T1 ,,so you get twelve y plus twenty-seven equals negative seventy-three,27:57.0,28:08.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
11093,4,1,T1 ,,so you subtract the twenty-seven,28:10.0,28:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11094,4,1,T1 ,,you get twelve y equals pause filler twenty-seven negative seventy-three a hundred negative one hundred,28:13.0,28:26.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
11095,4,1,T1 ,pause filler,,28:24.0,28:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11096,4,1,T1 ,,okay and negative one hundred twelfths or y equals negative pause filler twenty-five thirds,28:27.0,28:37.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
11097,4,1,T1 ,,because you can reduce it okay pause filler a hundred okay,28:39.0,28:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
11098,4,1,T1 ,,so you subtract the five p,28:46.0,28:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11099,4,1,T1 ,,,28:46.0,29:20.0,00:34.0,,,,,,
11100,4,1,T1 ,,so you get one hundred equals pause filler twenty p plus fifty,28:49.0,28:58.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
11101,4,1,T1 ,,subtract the fifty,29:00.0,29:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11102,4,1,T1 ,,you get fifty equals twenty p,29:01.0,29:06.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11103,4,1,T1 ,,pause filler you divide by twenty,29:06.0,29:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11104,4,1,T1 ,,you get five halves equals p,29:08.0,29:14.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11105,4,1,T1 ,,that's it,29:19.0,29:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11106,4,1,T1 ,I guess so,,29:20.0,29:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

11244,4,1,T2 ,I guess that's seventeen plus negative b equals thirteen b no wait plus b sorry,,42:32.0,42:52.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
11245,4,1,T2 ,so that's plus negative b negative two b equal what the what did I just do no,,42:52.0,43:17.0,00:25.0,,,,,,
11246,4,1,T2 ,,pause filler it should equal thirteen I think,43:17.0,43:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11247,4,1,T2 ,thirteen (inaudible) seventeen negative two b is equal to negative four (inaudible) two this one would be b is equal to two,,43:25.0,44:03.0,00:38.0,,,,,,
11248,4,1,T2 ,,yes,44:04.0,44:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

11563,4,2,T1 ,divided by fifteen x,,26:03.0,26:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11564,4,2,T1 ,pause filler fifteen divided by one fifteenth divided by one,,26:06.0,26:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11565,4,2,T1 ,,you just have to multiply the reciprocal of this,26:17.0,26:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11566,4,2,T1 ,okay so you oh so you don��_t oh my god these are like hugely yeah okay,,26:20.0,26:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11567,4,2,T1 ,,yeah so instead of one hundred,26:27.0,26:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11568,4,2,T1 ,fifteen times fifteen is two hundred twenty-five isn't it yeah,,26:28.0,26:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11569,4,2,T1 ,,one wait pause filler,26:33.0,26:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11570,4,2,T1 ,because you multiply by the reciprocal,,26:34.0,26:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11571,4,2,T1 ,so you get one pause filler over fifty,,26:38.0,26:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11572,4,2,T1 ,times fifteen x equals one thirty-five,,26:40.0,26:45.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11573,4,2,T1 ,so you get x,,26:45.0,26:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11574,4,2,T1 ,x equals pause filler one,,26:49.0,26:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11575,4,2,T1 ,oh my god one thirty-five times,,26:55.0,27:04.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
11576,4,2,T1 ,oh okay so you get pause filler five twenty-five pause filler,,27:04.0,27:10.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11577,4,2,T1 ,five times two is ten,,27:10.0,27:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11578,4,2,T1 ,ten pause filler is ten,,27:15.0,27:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11579,4,2,T1 ,so you get that,,27:17.0,27:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11580,4,2,T1 ,then you get times zero,,27:20.0,27:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11581,4,2,T1 ,you get pause filler three times five is fifteen,,27:23.0,27:31.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
11582,4,2,T1 ,pause filler three times two is six,,27:32.0,27:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11583,4,2,T1 ,but you have the actual ones,,27:33.0,27:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11584,4,2,T1 ,so seven,,27:34.0,27:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11585,4,2,T1 ,you get six oh one times,,27:35.0,27:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11586,4,2,T1 ,then you get five five two,,27:38.0,27:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11587,4,2,T1 ,add all that up,,27:42.0,27:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11588,4,2,T1 ,you get five seven,,27:44.0,27:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11589,4,2,T1 ,yeah thirteen and a thirteen and a one,,27:46.0,27:53.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
11590,4,2,T1 ,you get three,,27:53.0,27:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11591,4,2,T1 ,so x equals pause filler three three three seven five,,27:55.0,28:04.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
11592,4,2,T1 ,oh so that looks really bad,,28:04.0,28:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11593,4,2,T1 ,,,28:04.0,28:57.0,00:53.0,,,,,,
11594,4,2,T1 ,two hundred and twenty fifths,,28:06.0,28:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11595,4,2,T1 ,,okay oh,28:10.0,28:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11596,4,2,T1 ,all right pause filler that��_s actually much nicer fraction than everything else,,28:13.0,28:21.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
11597,4,2,T1 ,so you move the two ninety-two,,28:22.0,28:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11598,4,2,T1 ,you get twenty-nine x equals,,28:23.0,28:30.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
11599,4,2,T1 ,pause filler negative two hundred ninety,,28:30.0,28:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11600,4,2,T1 ,pause filler plus pause filler two ninths x,,28:42.0,28:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11601,4,2,T1 ,or pause filler you move that,,28:49.0,28:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11602,4,2,T1 ,you get twenty-nine point,,28:51.0,28:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11603,4,2,T1 ,or no you subtract it,,28:55.0,28:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11604,4,2,T1 ,so you get twenty pause filler,,28:56.0,29:04.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
11605,4,2,T1 ,okay,,29:16.0,29:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11606,4,2,T1 ,yeah okay,,30:20.0,30:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11607,4,2,S2 ,,,30:23.0,35:11.0,04:48.0,,,,,,
11608,4,2,S2 ,,I feel good,30:37.0,30:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11609,4,2,S2 ,okay,,30:39.0,30:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11610,4,2,S2 ,,good,35:14.0,35:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11611,4,2,S2 ,,(inaudible),35:14.0,35:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11612,4,2,S2 ,,oh yeah are you going to,35:56.0,35:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11613,4,2,S2 ,,yay,36:07.0,36:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11614,4,2,S2 ,,okay so okay,36:07.0,36:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11615,4,2,S2 ,,equal to twenty-five over one,36:10.0,36:24.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
11616,4,2,T2 ,,,36:12.0,38:02.0,01:50.0,,,,,,
11617,4,2,T2 ,,,36:12.0,37:05.0,00:53.0,,,,,,
11618,4,2,T2 ,,oh wait all right,36:24.0,36:33.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
11619,4,2,T2 ,,oh pause filler I see,36:33.0,36:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11620,4,2,T2 ,you can solve it that way,,36:34.0,36:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11621,4,2,T2 ,I just don��_t think that��_s the way they intended it to be solved,,36:36.0,36:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11622,4,2,T2 ,but yeah it's possible,,36:39.0,36:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11623,4,2,T2 ,,okay x is equal to that number ditto,36:41.0,37:01.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
11624,4,2,T2 ,,,37:06.0,40:45.0,03:39.0,,,,,,
11625,4,2,T2 ,,okay so negative three over y plus negative seventeen is equal to sixty-three,37:06.0,37:19.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
11626,4,2,T2 ,,plus seventeen,37:20.0,37:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11627,4,2,T2 ,,plus three over y is equal to,37:23.0,37:32.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
11628,4,2,T2 ,,eighty and then,37:32.0,37:41.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
11629,4,2,T2 ,,,38:09.0,56:32.0,18:23.0,,,,,,
11630,4,2,T2 ,,okay pause filler let's cancel out,38:11.0,38:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11631,4,2,T2 ,,y is equal to,38:13.0,38:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11632,4,2,T2 ,pause filler hold on,,38:15.0,38:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11633,4,2,T2 ,I don��_t think multiplying by three works,,38:16.0,38:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11634,4,2,T2 ,because don��_t you have to multiply it by y because y is what's three is being divided by,,38:19.0,38:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11635,4,2,T2 ,,probably,38:29.0,38:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11636,4,2,T2 ,,that's eighty pause filler,38:32.0,38:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11637,4,2,T2 ,pause filler so yeah,,38:37.0,38:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11638,4,2,T2 ,,pause filler negative three equals y,38:42.0,39:04.0,00:22.0,,,,,,
11639,4,2,T2 ,,so I'll multiply by y over negative three,39:05.0,39:26.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
11640,4,2,T2 ,pause filler multiply it by y over negative three,,39:27.0,39:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11641,4,2,T2 ,pause filler that would cancel the entire thing,,39:32.0,39:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11642,4,2,T2 ,I think you can just multiply it by y,,39:33.0,39:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11643,4,2,T2 ,and move pause filler the lower half over,,39:37.0,39:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11644,4,2,T2 ,so you get pause filler negative three equals,,39:39.0,39:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11645,4,2,T2 ,,oh wait I'm (inaudible),39:42.0,39:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11646,4,2,T2 ,that��_s fine,,39:47.0,39:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11647,4,2,T2 ,,so I'll just multiply byy,39:47.0,39:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11648,4,2,T2 ,yeah,,39:54.0,39:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11649,4,2,T2 ,,oh I see I see,39:54.0,39:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11650,4,2,T2 ,,okay I got it,39:56.0,39:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11651,4,2,T2 ,,times y times y,39:59.0,40:05.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11652,4,2,T2 ,,oh I see where this is going,40:05.0,40:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11653,4,2,T2 ,,negative three is equal to eighty y divided by,40:06.0,40:16.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
11654,4,2,T2 ,,wait a minute that would not work,40:16.0,40:26.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
11655,4,2,T2 ,,and y (inaudible) y,40:27.0,40:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11656,4,2,T2 ,,but it's y,40:28.0,40:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11657,4,2,T2 ,,pause filler divide it by eighty,40:30.0,40:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11658,4,2,T2 ,,eighty divided by eighty,40:34.0,40:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11659,4,2,T2 ,,negative three over eighty is equal to y,40:39.0,40:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11660,4,2,T2 ,,,40:50.0,42:08.0,01:18.0,,,,,,
11661,4,2,T2 ,,pause filler okay four over k plus fifty-four is equal to one sixteen,40:50.0,41:02.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
11662,4,2,T2 ,,fifty-four,41:08.0,41:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

11665,4,2,T2 ,,eleven six sixty-two,41:28.0,41:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11666,4,2,T2 ,,is equal to four over k,41:30.0,41:37.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
11667,4,2,T2 ,,divided by k,41:38.0,41:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11668,4,2,T2 ,,equal signs,41:41.0,41:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11669,4,2,T2 ,,four is equal to sixty-two k divided by sixty-two,41:45.0,41:54.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
11670,4,2,T2 ,,k is equal to (inaudible),41:58.0,42:03.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11671,4,2,T2 ,okay,,42:07.0,42:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11672,4,2,T2 ,,oh oh I see (inaudible),42:07.0,42:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11673,4,2,T2 ,,,42:08.0,42:17.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
11674,4,2,T2 ,,,42:08.0,42:44.0,00:36.0,,,,,,
11675,4,2,T2 ,,okay so multiply both sides by y,42:08.0,42:17.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
11676,4,2,T2 ,,so two times y is equal to negative fourteen,42:20.0,42:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11677,4,2,T2 ,,divide two ten by both sides,42:29.0,42:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

11891,5,1,S1 ,,she's insane in everything,06:13.0,06:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11892,5,1,S1 ,,I don't know how she does it,06:15.0,06:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11893,5,1,S1 ,I don't know how anyone does it to be perfectly honest,,06:17.0,06:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11894,5,1,S1 ,,yeah so now everyone just idols her,06:20.0,06:28.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
11895,5,1,S1 ,,oh,06:29.0,06:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11896,5,1,S1 ,so what's your stance in your class,,06:29.0,06:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,QE,
11897,5,1,S1 ,are you like pretty cool or,,06:31.0,06:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,QE,
11898,5,1,S1 ,,pause filler I was,06:33.0,06:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,SD
11899,5,1,S1 ,,and then somebody found out I like watching Japanese shows,06:36.0,06:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,SD
11900,5,1,S1 ,,and now barely anybody talks to me,06:40.0,06:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,SD
11901,5,1,S1 ,,I don't understand why it's a big deal (laughter),06:44.0,06:57.0,00:13.0,,,,,,SD
11902,5,1,S1 ,I'm sorry,,06:59.0,06:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11903,5,1,S1 ,pause filler I have a cousin I guess who's sort of like you,,07:01.0,07:09.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
11904,5,1,S1 ,pause filler except he watches My Little Pony,,07:11.0,07:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11905,5,1,S1 ,,oh,07:14.0,07:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11906,5,1,S1 ,do you know what those people are,,07:15.0,07:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,QE,
11907,5,1,S1 ,,yeah,07:18.0,07:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11908,5,1,S1 ,he's like seventeen,,07:19.0,07:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11909,5,1,S1 ,,seventeen,07:23.0,07:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11910,5,1,S1 ,yeah,,07:24.0,07:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11911,5,1,S1 ,,okay (inaudible) seems like thirteen or fourteen,07:24.0,07:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11912,5,1,S1 ,,and we understand just for like popularity wise you have like a joke,07:27.0,07:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11913,5,1,S1 ,,but it depends on really what you see in childhood to really watch the show,07:32.0,07:38.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11914,5,1,S1 ,oh yeah I mean I was like he's like whatever he has in his computer out or his Xbox out,,07:39.0,07:47.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
11915,5,1,S1 ,and he has like a profile picture of like I don't know one of the weird things I,,07:47.0,07:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11916,5,1,S1 ,all right,,08:22.0,08:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11917,5,1,S1 ,all right roger that,,08:57.0,08:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11918,5,1,T1 ,,,08:59.0,28:57.0,19:58.0,,,,,,
11919,5,1,T1 ,,all right,08:59.0,09:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11920,5,1,T1 ,,,09:00.0,13:14.0,04:14.0,,,,,,
11921,5,1,T1 ,all right so pause filler ding it,,09:00.0,09:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11922,5,1,T1 ,all right so basically pause filler all right so pause filler you see this problem here,,09:07.0,09:15.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
11923,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,09:16.0,09:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11924,5,1,T1 ,all right I'm writing good so,,09:16.0,09:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11925,5,1,T1 ,all right so basically,,09:20.0,09:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11926,5,1,T1 ,pause filler do you see the variable here,,09:27.0,09:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11927,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,09:30.0,09:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11928,5,1,T1 ,okay why is my thing blue,,09:30.0,09:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11929,5,1,T1 ,,was this supposed to be green,09:33.0,09:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11930,5,1,T1 ,yeah,,09:35.0,09:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11931,5,1,T1 ,all right so see the variable over here,,09:35.0,09:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11932,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,09:39.0,09:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11933,5,1,T1 ,basically what you have to do is that you have to get the variable by itself,,09:39.0,09:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11934,5,1,T1 ,and pause filler the way you do that is by pause filler adding on both sides,,09:45.0,09:53.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
11935,5,1,T1 ,and it's sort of weird I know because math all right so,,09:54.0,10:01.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
11936,5,1,T1 ,pause filler what you do is that if you have a subtraction space there if you have sign that's subtracted pause filler what you do is that you write below it add that number,,10:01.0,10:15.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
11937,5,1,T1 ,you see,,10:16.0,10:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11938,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,10:19.0,10:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11939,5,1,T1 ,so and then you'd add it to that side,,10:19.0,10:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11940,5,1,T1 ,so you'd write plus number on the thirteen you,,10:21.0,10:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11941,5,1,T1 ,see what I'm saying,,10:25.0,10:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11942,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,10:26.0,10:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11943,5,1,T1 ,so try it out,,10:27.0,10:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11944,5,1,T1 ,,so let's take a walk,10:28.0,10:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11945,5,1,T1 ,,so here you'd be adding okay,10:32.0,10:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11946,5,1,T1 ,,wow,10:36.0,10:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11947,5,1,T1 ,,this is weird,10:36.0,10:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11948,5,1,T1 ,oh it's all right yeah (laughter),,10:38.0,10:44.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11949,5,1,T1 ,,wow,10:44.0,10:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11950,5,1,T1 ,oh no no no you don't add the x,,10:46.0,10:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11951,5,1,T1 ,you add the six,,10:50.0,10:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11952,5,1,T1 ,,oh that's right,10:52.0,10:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11953,5,1,T1 ,,I can do that okay,10:53.0,10:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11954,5,1,T1 ,,let's see I can undo this,10:55.0,10:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11955,5,1,T1 ,like have you ever used one of these things before,,10:58.0,11:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11956,5,1,T1 ,,no,11:02.0,11:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11957,5,1,T1 ,oh man it works like a charm if you're trying to like draw on stuff,,11:03.0,11:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11958,5,1,T1 ,but I have like a surface,,11:07.0,11:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11959,5,1,T1 ,so basically what I do is that I get a Bluetooth mouse,,11:09.0,11:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11960,5,1,T1 ,and I use that to draw most of the time,,11:13.0,11:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11961,5,1,T1 ,but pause filler anyways let's just get back on topic,,11:17.0,11:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11962,5,1,T1 ,so what you do is that you would add the number not the variable,,11:19.0,11:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11963,5,1,T1 ,you want to get the variable by itself,,11:22.0,11:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11964,5,1,T1 ,,uh-huh,11:25.0,11:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11965,5,1,T1 ,yeah,,11:25.0,11:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11966,5,1,T1 ,,so then here would be the plus six,11:26.0,11:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11967,5,1,T1 ,,and yeah I'll also add six,11:29.0,11:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11968,5,1,T1 ,pause filler yes,,11:33.0,11:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11969,5,1,T1 ,correct,,11:34.0,11:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11970,5,1,T1 ,,okay so,11:35.0,11:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11971,5,1,T1 ,pause filler basically pause filler just scratch out the six sort of like pause filler sort of like this,,11:39.0,11:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
11972,5,1,T1 ,,I see there we go,11:48.0,11:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11973,5,1,T1 ,so just pretend that six doesn't exist anymore,,11:52.0,11:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11974,5,1,T1 ,,right,11:56.0,11:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11975,5,1,T1 ,oh and I'll rewrite that because I accidentally did it,,11:57.0,12:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11976,5,1,T1 ,I was trying to,,12:00.0,12:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11977,5,1,T1 ,oh whoops crap,,12:06.0,12:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11978,5,1,T1 ,all right,,12:10.0,12:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11979,5,1,T1 ,are you still scratching up the six now,,12:16.0,12:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11980,5,1,T1 ,all you have to do is put a cross between the negative six and the plus six,,12:19.0,12:26.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
11981,5,1,T1 ,but you keep the six on the thirteen side as it is,,12:27.0,12:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11982,5,1,T1 ,,right wait okay it asked me a question,12:31.0,12:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11983,5,1,T1 ,,so I don't know why I did that,12:34.0,12:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11984,5,1,T1 ,it went full screen on my Skype for a second,,12:37.0,12:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11985,5,1,T1 ,,okay,12:40.0,12:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
11986,5,1,T1 ,okay so you see pause filler all you need to do is just add,,12:43.0,12:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11987,5,1,T1 ,,so then this would be nineteen,12:49.0,12:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11988,5,1,T1 ,,great,12:52.0,12:52.0,00:00.0,,,0,,,
11989,5,1,T1 ,yeah,,12:52.0,12:52.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11990,5,1,T1 ,,we'll put a nine there and separate that,12:53.0,12:59.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
11991,5,1,T1 ,and then you'd write x sequels because that's the only thing left,,12:59.0,13:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11992,5,1,T1 ,,oh yeah so then okay yeah that's starting to make sense,13:05.0,13:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
11993,5,1,T1 ,yeah so now you're done,,13:10.0,13:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
11994,5,1,T1 ,,sweet,13:13.0,13:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
11995,5,1,T1 ,,,13:15.0,14:39.0,01:24.0,,,,,,
11996,5,1,T1 ,,so we go to the next problem right,13:15.0,13:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11997,5,1,T1 ,yeah all right so that would be oh my gosh twenty-three,,13:18.0,13:22.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
11998,5,1,T1 ,all right this is going to be the end of me,,13:22.0,13:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
11999,5,1,T1 ,so all right so usually get a basic of this one right because all you have to do is just add again,,13:25.0,13:35.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
12000,5,1,T1 ,you just add to both sides,,13:35.0,13:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12001,5,1,T1 ,so it's basically just do it again I guess it's a,,13:36.0,13:41.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12002,5,1,T1 ,,it's good practice to fully understand it,13:41.0,13:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12003,5,1,T1 ,yeah and the only difference here is that it's flipped,,13:45.0,13:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12004,5,1,T1 ,and that it has a p,,13:50.0,13:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12005,5,1,T1 ,I don't know how that's supposed to confuse us in anyway whatsoever but (laughter),,13:52.0,13:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12006,5,1,T1 ,,so I was going to cross that out because it's not really going to do much,13:56.0,14:02.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12007,5,1,T1 ,yeah you could just cross at it first I mean pause filler yeah,,14:02.0,14:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12008,5,1,T1 ,they write really weird on this paper because they have like oh I'm not allowed to showed it but they put like the nine after the p (laughter) like the plus eight after,,14:10.0,14:24.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
12009,5,1,T1 ,I don't know,,14:25.0,14:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12010,5,1,T1 ,,that's strange,14:26.0,14:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12011,5,1,T1 ,I know,,14:28.0,14:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12012,5,1,T1 ,college students you know all right,,14:29.0,14:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12013,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,14:31.0,14:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12014,5,1,T1 ,all right so you got that one,,14:32.0,14:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12015,5,1,T1 ,I'm just going to do that to confirm it,,14:34.0,14:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12016,5,1,T1 ,pause filler next page,,14:38.0,14:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12017,5,1,T1 ,,,14:40.0,15:32.0,00:52.0,,,,,,
12018,5,1,T1 ,,this is subtraction right,14:40.0,14:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12019,5,1,T1 ,yeah,,14:43.0,14:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12020,5,1,T1 ,all right so pause filler basically what you do is that instead of adding like we did before we subtract,,14:44.0,14:53.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
12021,5,1,T1 ,whoo,,14:53.0,14:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12022,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,14:54.0,14:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12023,5,1,T1 ,and then (inaudible) because that's going to that's pause filler because that's a pause filler addition symbol,,14:54.0,15:12.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
12024,5,1,T1 ,pause filler and basically what you have to do is that you have to do the exact opposite of the symbol that's up there,,15:12.0,15:20.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
12025,5,1,T1 ,you see,,15:20.0,15:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12026,5,1,T1 ,,yup,15:21.0,15:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12027,5,1,T1 ,pause filler so basically,,15:22.0,15:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12028,5,1,T1 ,pause filler it's really simple (laughter),,15:24.0,15:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12029,5,1,T1 ,and then you just do it the other side I mean,,15:28.0,15:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12030,5,1,T1 ,,,15:32.0,18:12.0,02:40.0,,,,,,
12031,5,1,T1 ,and they also made it okay this time,,15:32.0,15:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12032,5,1,T1 ,so that's the part that confused me the most,,15:35.0,15:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12033,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,15:38.0,15:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12034,5,1,T1 ,yeah,,15:38.0,15:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12035,5,1,T1 ,,so this is basically just six equals k,15:39.0,15:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12036,5,1,T1 ,,right,15:48.0,15:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12037,5,1,T1 ,pause filler yeah,,15:49.0,15:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12038,5,1,T1 ,we don't even need to do that much work for that one because that's like simple simple math,,15:50.0,15:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12039,5,1,T1 ,all right good job,,15:54.0,15:56.0,00:02.0,,,,LPB,,
12040,5,1,T1 ,,thanks,15:57.0,15:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12041,5,1,T1 ,all right next problem,,15:59.0,16:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12042,5,1,T1 ,oh whoops,,16:01.0,16:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12043,5,1,T1 ,I don't want to double-click,,16:02.0,16:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12044,5,1,T1 ,thank you p keyboard,,16:03.0,16:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12045,5,1,T1 ,all right this one is easier than it looks,,16:06.0,16:13.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12046,5,1,T1 ,all you have to do is divide,,16:14.0,16:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12047,5,1,T1 ,and then you're done,,16:18.0,16:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12048,5,1,T1 ,,I think I got it already,16:18.0,16:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,SD,
12049,5,1,T1 ,you did,,16:21.0,16:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12050,5,1,T1 ,,yeah I saw it,16:24.0,16:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12051,5,1,T1 ,,and then it came to me,16:25.0,16:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12052,5,1,T1 ,,but I think I'll do the math just in case okay,16:27.0,16:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12053,5,1,T1 ,yeah because they want you to do the math and stuff like that because they have like cameras all around us and stuff,,16:32.0,16:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12054,5,1,T1 ,,yeah I don't like camearas,16:38.0,16:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,SD,
12055,5,1,T1 ,I know they're scary (sfx),,16:40.0,16:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12056,5,1,T1 ,,boy that floor looks really weird,16:44.0,16:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12057,5,1,T1 ,looks like that's more like Malaysian symbol or something,,16:49.0,16:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12058,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,16:53.0,16:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12059,5,1,T1 ,,so yeah it is kind of is five,16:54.0,17:01.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12060,5,1,T1 ,,right,17:01.0,17:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12061,5,1,T1 ,pause filler five,,17:03.0,17:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12062,5,1,T1 ,pause filler how explain your answer,,17:05.0,17:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12063,5,1,T1 ,,okay I'll explain it in math,17:08.0,17:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12064,5,1,T1 ,,got five,17:13.0,17:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12065,5,1,T1 ,,it doesn't really look like a five,17:14.0,17:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12066,5,1,T1 ,,so that's twenty,17:19.0,17:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12067,5,1,T1 ,,so we got zero there,17:20.0,17:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12068,5,1,T1 ,,no,17:22.0,17:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12069,5,1,T1 ,,undo that,17:24.0,17:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12070,5,1,T1 ,,no,17:26.0,17:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12071,5,1,T1 ,,why,17:26.0,17:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12072,5,1,T1 ,,I don't want it,17:27.0,17:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12073,5,1,T1 ,,okay there we go,17:29.0,17:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12074,5,1,T1 ,,we put the zero there,17:31.0,17:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12075,5,1,T1 ,,and then five times four is twenty,17:33.0,17:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12076,5,1,T1 ,,so you have an extra two y two twenty,17:36.0,17:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12077,5,1,T1 ,,hey it is right,17:40.0,17:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12078,5,1,T1 ,,I do my math right right,17:43.0,17:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12079,5,1,T1 ,pause filler hold on,,17:49.0,17:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12080,5,1,T1 ,pause filler forty-four,,17:53.0,17:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12081,5,1,T1 ,then we go into that,,17:53.0,17:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12082,5,1,T1 ,then we go into that,,17:56.0,17:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12083,5,1,T1 ,yeah you're correct,,17:59.0,18:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12084,5,1,T1 ,,sweet,18:00.0,18:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12085,5,1,T1 ,all right so basically what you do is that you'd say x equals five because pause filler the two twenty is gone,,18:02.0,18:08.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12086,5,1,T1 ,and then the forty-four is gone,,18:08.0,18:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12087,5,1,T1 ,so you just have to leave it at five so,,18:09.0,18:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12088,5,1,T1 ,pause filler all right perfect line,,18:12.0,18:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12089,5,1,T1 ,all right page five,,18:16.0,18:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12090,5,1,T1 ,,,18:16.0,26:20.0,08:04.0,,,,,,
12091,5,1,T1 ,oh I don't want to double-click,,18:18.0,18:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12092,5,1,T1 ,oh my gosh,,18:23.0,18:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12093,5,1,T1 ,now it's showing me Adobe Flash Player,,18:23.0,18:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12094,5,1,T1 ,this isn't an Adobe Flash game,,18:25.0,18:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12095,5,1,T1 ,and I just closed another room,,18:27.0,18:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12096,5,1,T1 ,well I don't think that did anything I hope (laughter),,18:29.0,18:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12097,5,1,T1 ,all right what's this,,18:32.0,18:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12098,5,1,T1 ,all right pause filler if you saw that that's just what I'm clarifying pause filler people CMU so,,18:38.0,18:43.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12099,5,1,T1 ,,is that are there is that a minus with the thirteen p and forty-one or is that an equal sign,18:43.0,18:51.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
12100,5,1,T1 ,,for some reason I only see one line,18:52.0,18:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12101,5,1,T1 ,oh you just have to click the screen again,,18:56.0,18:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12102,5,1,T1 ,,oh,18:58.0,18:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12103,5,1,T1 ,oh you see it now,,19:00.0,19:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12104,5,1,T1 ,,yeah I faintly see it,19:04.0,19:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12105,5,1,T1 ,,so I got that in mind now,19:06.0,19:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12106,5,1,T1 ,pause filler it's minus nine plus thirteen p equals forty-one,,19:08.0,19:14.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12107,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,19:16.0,19:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12108,5,1,T1 ,,let's see how we would oh wait so we would,19:17.0,19:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12109,5,1,T1 ,,add nine to the negative nine and forty-one,19:22.0,19:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12110,5,1,T1 ,we'd add nine to forty-one,,19:27.0,19:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12111,5,1,T1 ,we wouldn't do anything with subtraction,,19:29.0,19:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12112,5,1,T1 ,,right so plus because pause filler we're just doing the opposite on the other side,19:34.0,19:42.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
12113,5,1,T1 ,,we're not really,19:42.0,19:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12114,5,1,T1 ,,oh yeah so the negative nine really doesn't have any value to us as of right now,19:44.0,19:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12115,5,1,T1 ,yeah and all you have to do is do it on the other side too,,19:50.0,19:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12116,5,1,T1 ,and then just cross it out because it says they said we have to like show our work,,19:53.0,19:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12117,5,1,T1 ,and that's why we typically do it,,19:58.0,19:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12118,5,1,T1 ,,yeah so only teachers could explain it this simply,20:01.0,20:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12119,5,1,T1 ,pause filler hearing it from a kid is like ten times better,,20:04.0,20:08.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12120,5,1,T1 ,,yeah why,20:08.0,20:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12121,5,1,T1 ,,I can't draw on this,20:09.0,20:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,SD,
12122,5,1,T1 ,oh,,20:12.0,20:12.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12123,5,1,T1 ,,okay let's see,20:14.0,20:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12124,5,1,T1 ,,here we go,20:19.0,20:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12125,5,1,T1 ,whoops,,20:20.0,20:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12126,5,1,T1 ,,yeah I'll draw another one,20:22.0,20:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12127,5,1,T1 ,all right,,20:24.0,20:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12128,5,1,T1 ,,here we go,20:25.0,20:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12129,5,1,T1 ,yeah yeah all right you got fifty,,20:25.0,20:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12130,5,1,T1 ,,fifty and thirteen,20:28.0,20:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12131,5,1,T1 ,and then here comes the trickier part,,20:29.0,20:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12132,5,1,T1 ,you have (laughter) oh you have to pause filler divide fifty by thirteen,,20:32.0,20:39.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12133,5,1,T1 ,,oh you got to be kidding me,20:39.0,20:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12134,5,1,T1 ,which is actually pretty difficult,,20:42.0,20:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12135,5,1,T1 ,,yeah because it doesn't go into any bits,20:45.0,20:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12136,5,1,T1 ,,so you have to figure out what number it is,20:47.0,20:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12137,5,1,T1 ,yeah so just I mean it will take a while because we're riding on this thing,,20:51.0,20:56.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12138,5,1,T1 ,and you're obviously a newbie to this sport,,20:56.0,20:59.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
12139,5,1,T1 ,so pause filler might pause filler be a bit difficult,,20:59.0,21:06.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12140,5,1,T1 ,,all right I'm going to wing it here,21:07.0,21:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12141,5,1,T1 ,,and see where pause filler thirteen times five gets me,21:10.0,21:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12142,5,1,T1 ,,and then I'll try to see how that goes,21:14.0,21:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12143,5,1,T1 ,thirteen times five,,21:18.0,21:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12144,5,1,T1 ,how does that work,,21:20.0,21:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12145,5,1,T1 ,,pause filler well for me what I would do is that I would you know do the problem,21:21.0,21:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12146,5,1,T1 ,,and if that's not the number I'd to go a little higher then to a little lower which then,21:27.0,21:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12147,5,1,T1 ,oh,,21:31.0,21:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12148,5,1,T1 ,,wow that's not it at all,21:33.0,21:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12149,5,1,T1 ,,pause filler I'm going to try four because four seems to be the magic number today,21:36.0,21:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12150,5,1,T1 ,,all right do me some good,21:44.0,21:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12151,5,1,T1 ,,okay that's not a twelve,21:49.0,21:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12152,5,1,T1 ,,that's not a two,21:51.0,21:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12153,5,1,T1 ,that's a twenty,,21:52.0,21:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12154,5,1,T1 ,that's a z oh,,21:53.0,21:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12155,5,1,T1 ,,it's something,21:56.0,21:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12156,5,1,T1 ,,it's something,21:58.0,21:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12157,5,1,T1 ,surely,,22:00.0,22:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12158,5,1,T1 ,,so it,22:01.0,22:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12159,5,1,T1 ,,wow,22:02.0,22:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12160,5,1,T1 ,,that's actually really close,22:03.0,22:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12161,5,1,T1 ,,so my guess it would be three because,22:06.0,22:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12162,5,1,T1 ,I don't think it would be three,,22:10.0,22:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12163,5,1,T1 ,it would have to be pause filler a decimal number because pause filler it's between three and four,,22:10.0,22:16.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12164,5,1,T1 ,pause filler if you did three and if you did basic math you'd get thirty-nine,,22:16.0,22:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12165,5,1,T1 ,,yeah so we would have so,22:20.0,22:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12166,5,1,T1 ,you just have to divide,,22:24.0,22:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12167,5,1,T1 ,I mean there's really no other way of doing it,,22:25.0,22:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12168,5,1,T1 ,,yeah so we get there,22:28.0,22:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12169,5,1,T1 ,,and it would be,22:30.0,22:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12170,5,1,T1 ,,wow,22:35.0,22:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12171,5,1,T1 ,,this okay so we would get eleven from this right,22:35.0,22:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12172,5,1,T1 ,,if we were to subtract this,22:40.0,22:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12173,5,1,T1 ,,I'm totally stumped,22:43.0,22:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12174,5,1,T1 ,,I'm totally stumped,22:44.0,22:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12175,5,1,T1 ,all right so let me tell you what you would do,,22:45.0,22:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12176,5,1,T1 ,so basically what you would do is that you just write thirteen,,22:49.0,22:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12177,5,1,T1 ,and undo that,,22:53.0,22:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12178,5,1,T1 ,and then fifty,,22:54.0,22:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12179,5,1,T1 ,all right,,23:00.0,23:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12180,5,1,T1 ,and then what you do is that you try to find the highest number that's closest to this which is pause filler three,,23:01.0,23:08.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12181,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,23:09.0,23:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12182,5,1,T1 ,and then you do that,,23:11.0,23:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12183,5,1,T1 ,and you get thirty-nine,,23:12.0,23:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12184,5,1,T1 ,and then you'd cross out the five,,23:17.0,23:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12185,5,1,T1 ,and then you get the four,,23:18.0,23:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12186,5,1,T1 ,and then you get that,,23:20.0,23:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12187,5,1,T1 ,and then you get one hundred and ten,,23:22.0,23:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12188,5,1,T1 ,and then what you'd have to do is you'd have to ridiculously try to find what one hundred and ten is,,23:24.0,23:31.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12189,5,1,T1 ,so pause filler thirteen times,,23:32.0,23:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12190,5,1,T1 ,pause filler let's try eight,,23:39.0,23:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12191,5,1,T1 ,pause filler twenty-four,,23:41.0,23:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12192,5,1,T1 ,pause filler one zero four,,23:46.0,23:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12193,5,1,T1 ,that's correct,,23:47.0,23:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12194,5,1,T1 ,so it would be eight and one zero four pause filler oh six,,23:48.0,23:57.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
12195,5,1,T1 ,sixty,,24:00.0,24:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12196,5,1,T1 ,now if you we're going to get an answer like this it's going to be like infinite all right,,24:02.0,24:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12197,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,24:08.0,24:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12198,5,1,T1 ,pause filler what we're going to do is that we're going to get this,,24:08.0,24:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12199,5,1,T1 ,and then we're going to do it,,24:12.0,24:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12200,5,1,T1 ,we're going to get one more decimal number,,24:13.0,24:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12201,5,1,T1 ,and if it's above five we just set it to the number above it,,24:16.0,24:21.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12202,5,1,T1 ,so pause filler let's say we get seven,,24:21.0,24:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12203,5,1,T1 ,pause filler we get like three point seven eight,,24:27.0,24:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12204,5,1,T1 ,if this number is four we don't have to change it,,24:30.0,24:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12205,5,1,T1 ,,oh yeah because it rounds up or down depending on the number and then the last of it,24:34.0,24:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12206,5,1,T1 ,yeah yeah and so basically this is just going to be a rounding thing,,24:39.0,24:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12207,5,1,T1 ,and yeah so pause filler,,24:45.0,24:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12208,5,1,T1 ,thirteen,,24:51.0,24:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12209,5,1,T1 ,,and sixteen,24:54.0,24:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12210,5,1,T1 ,,wouldn't that be four then,24:58.0,25:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12211,5,1,T1 ,it would have,,25:00.0,25:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12212,5,1,T1 ,,yeah because thirteen times four is fifty-two,25:03.0,25:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12213,5,1,T1 ,yeah right you're looking at your previous work,,25:07.0,25:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12214,5,1,T1 ,and I'm not (laughter),,25:10.0,25:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12215,5,1,T1 ,all right and then fifty-two,,25:12.0,25:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12216,5,1,T1 ,oh I'm going off the page ding it,,25:14.0,25:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12217,5,1,T1 ,and then that would be eight,,25:17.0,25:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12218,5,1,T1 ,and then that would be eighty,,25:20.0,25:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12219,5,1,T1 ,so it's obviously a number higher than five you see,,25:21.0,25:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12220,5,1,T1 ,so this would round to,,25:26.0,25:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12221,5,1,T1 ,,three point eight five,25:29.0,25:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12222,5,1,T1 ,yeah correct,,25:31.0,25:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12223,5,1,T1 ,,all right,25:32.0,25:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12224,5,1,T1 ,oh do you know what I just realized,,25:35.0,25:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12225,5,1,T1 ,,what,25:37.0,25:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12226,5,1,T1 ,what we could've done this is going to sound really really bad pause filler,,25:39.0,25:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12227,5,1,T1 ,basically what we could've done is that we could've just done this,,25:47.0,25:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12228,5,1,T1 ,and then we could've just stopped,,25:55.0,26:07.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
12229,5,1,T1 ,,(laughter) oh wow,26:07.0,26:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12230,5,1,T1 ,oh we overcomplicated the problem,,26:09.0,26:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12231,5,1,T1 ,,yeah oh my gosh,26:11.0,26:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12232,5,1,T1 ,all right but I think we showed enough work on this page already,,26:12.0,26:19.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12233,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,26:19.0,26:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12234,5,1,T1 ,,there's nothing (inaudible),26:20.0,26:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12235,5,1,T1 ,pause filler,,26:20.0,26:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12236,5,1,T1 ,so I'm just going to underline both of these just in case,,26:22.0,26:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12237,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,26:28.0,26:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

12242,5,1,T1 ,,okay I think I got this,26:39.0,26:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12243,5,1,T1 ,,let's see if I can get this,26:41.0,26:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12244,5,1,T1 ,all right,,26:42.0,26:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12245,5,1,T1 ,,wait not it kept cutting out,26:47.0,26:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12246,5,1,T1 ,,I have no idea why the pen cuts out,26:50.0,26:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,SD,
12247,5,1,T1 ,,come on undo,26:53.0,26:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12248,5,1,T1 ,,I tell you to undo you undo,26:54.0,26:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12249,5,1,T1 ,,here we go,26:59.0,27:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12250,5,1,T1 ,,no I want that there,27:00.0,27:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12251,5,1,T1 ,,there we go okay,27:01.0,27:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12252,5,1,T1 ,,let's try this again,27:03.0,27:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12253,5,1,T1 ,,oh sweet,27:06.0,27:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12254,5,1,T1 ,all right that was okay I mean oh,,27:07.0,27:11.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12255,5,1,T1 ,,yeah I am so new to this,27:12.0,27:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,SD,
12256,5,1,T1 ,well it just takes time to get used to I mean,,27:16.0,27:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12257,5,1,T1 ,,yeah well everything in general takes time to get used to,27:19.0,27:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12258,5,1,T1 ,yeah like I've only used this three times but I don't own one,,27:24.0,27:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,SD
12259,5,1,T1 ,but I am really good at using it,,27:28.0,27:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,SD
12260,5,1,T1 ,like I could just like draw something really good on this side,,27:29.0,27:35.0,00:06.0,,,,,,SD
12261,5,1,T1 ,but (inaudible) pause filler yes six divided by twenty-four that's four equals x right,,27:35.0,27:41.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12262,5,1,T1 ,we actually got a simpler answer,,27:41.0,27:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12263,5,1,T1 ,thank you CMU all right,,27:43.0,27:46.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
12264,5,1,T1 ,,I don't understand college technology,27:46.0,27:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12265,5,1,T1 ,(inaudible) pause filler this is like I'm in a game designing studios,,27:50.0,27:56.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12266,5,1,T1 ,so I guess that's why they use this so (inaudible) yeah so,,27:56.0,28:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12267,5,1,T1 ,,I have a room surrounded by glass,28:00.0,28:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12268,5,1,T1 ,that is terrifying,,28:07.0,28:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12269,5,1,T1 ,,yeah,28:08.0,28:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12270,5,1,T1 ,all right so pause filler this one is a bit easier I guess,,28:09.0,28:16.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12271,5,1,T1 ,so take note I said I guess,,28:16.0,28:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12272,5,1,T1 ,so pause filler what we're going to do is that this is probably going to be another one of those problems where it's going to be like ridiculously like pause filler,,28:19.0,28:28.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
12273,5,1,T1 ,,just a crazy crazy number,28:28.0,28:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12274,5,1,T1 ,yeah so all we have to do is that we have to make a fraction this time all right,,28:31.0,28:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12275,5,1,T1 ,,yeah a fraction,28:37.0,28:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12276,5,1,T1 ,yeah because we're wait one minute,,28:38.0,28:43.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12277,5,1,T1 ,yeah,,28:47.0,28:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12278,5,1,T1 ,I'm not looking at this at all pause filler,,28:48.0,28:53.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12279,5,1,T1 ,,all right hang on a sec,28:53.0,28:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12280,5,1,T1 ,,okay,29:03.0,29:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12281,5,1,T1 ,all right,,29:24.0,29:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12282,5,1,T1 ,roger that,,29:38.0,29:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12283,5,1,T1 ,all right so now you're going to tutor me,,29:41.0,29:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12284,5,1,S2 ,,,29:42.0,35:04.0,05:22.0,,,,,,
12285,5,1,S2 ,,sweet,29:44.0,29:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12286,5,1,S2 ,yeah so basically what's going to happen is that you're going to pause filler master the art of the pause filler this thing,,29:45.0,29:55.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
12287,5,1,S2 ,and it's going to be great,,29:56.0,29:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12288,5,1,S2 ,like what you get used to it it's going to be sweet,,29:58.0,30:03.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12289,5,1,S2 ,you're going to be like mastering pause filler as you animate people say it going Super Saiyan,,30:03.0,30:10.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12290,5,1,S2 ,,yeah,30:10.0,30:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12291,5,1,S2 ,yeah so pause filler weirdos,,30:11.0,30:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12292,5,1,S2 ,anyway basically pause filler it's sort of hard to get used to,,30:15.0,30:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12293,5,1,S2 ,but once you start to realize that it's just like a piece of paper,,30:20.0,30:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12294,5,1,S2 ,it's really really easy,,30:24.0,30:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12295,5,1,S2 ,,yeah like the one thing that gets me off is that you have like a smaller pad to draw on,30:25.0,30:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,SD,
12296,5,1,S2 ,,but then the pad gets so much larger,30:30.0,30:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12297,5,1,S2 ,oh yeah basically what they use this for is that they're able to adjust the page,,30:33.0,30:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12298,5,1,S2 ,but we're not,,30:39.0,30:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12299,5,1,S2 ,like you have to be on like that side (inaudible) the thing that we on that side is okay,,30:41.0,30:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12300,5,1,S2 ,so it's basically like telling us how big the page should be,,30:45.0,30:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12301,5,1,S2 ,so it's sort of like an adaption process because you have to like pause filler on the screen you have to like get used to the size,,30:48.0,30:58.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
12302,5,1,S2 ,so basically if you're to do a straight line like this on this thing on that side it be like the way you'd want it to be drawn,,30:58.0,31:08.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
12303,5,1,S2 ,but if you're to do this and that page is like this it's going to like be really short,,31:08.0,31:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12304,5,1,S2 ,,yeah oh,31:16.0,31:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12305,5,1,S2 ,yeah,,31:19.0,31:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12306,5,1,S2 ,,if only this is like heat sensitive,31:19.0,31:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12307,5,1,S2 ,,so I can use my hands,31:21.0,31:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12308,5,1,S2 ,,this would be so much easier,31:23.0,31:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12309,5,1,S2 ,oh yeah definitely but,,31:25.0,31:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12310,5,1,S2 ,and they don't have the mouses turned on,,31:26.0,31:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12311,5,1,S2 ,so you can't I don't know,,31:28.0,31:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12312,5,1,S2 ,,oh a mouse probably would've been the easiest,31:30.0,31:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12313,5,1,S2 ,I know I'm used to using my mouse,,31:33.0,31:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,SD
12314,5,1,S2 ,so and I'm good at drawing with my mouse,,31:35.0,31:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,SD
12315,5,1,S2 ,,I just draw on the computer when I get very very bored,31:40.0,31:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,SD,
12316,5,1,S2 ,oh who doesn't draw on the computer whenever they get really bored,,31:44.0,31:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

12367,5,1,S2 ,,pause filler it's about a Google,34:46.0,34:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12368,5,1,S2 ,,someone did like pause filler an animated drawing of a Titan from a show and stuff like that,34:47.0,34:57.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
12369,5,1,S2 ,,and I don't feel like putting my picture up anywhere,34:57.0,35:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

12371,5,1,S2 ,,all sweet this time,35:03.0,35:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12372,5,1,S2 ,well we weren't doing anything,,35:10.0,35:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12373,5,1,S2 ,all right,,35:16.0,35:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12374,5,1,S2 ,I think I exited out the other one,,35:25.0,35:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12375,5,1,S2 ,yeah,,35:29.0,35:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12376,5,1,S2 ,all right,,35:39.0,35:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12377,5,1,S2 ,,got it,35:40.0,35:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12378,5,1,S2 ,yeah because I was closing something up there,,35:44.0,35:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12379,5,1,S2 ,and I accidentally closed pause filler that one so pause filler,,35:47.0,35:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12380,5,1,S2 ,yeah that's really cool,,35:52.0,35:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12381,5,1,S2 ,all right so I'm going to get everything,,35:54.0,35:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12382,5,1,S2 ,I'm good (laughter),,36:05.0,36:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12383,5,1,S2 ,thank you,,36:07.0,36:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12384,5,1,S2 ,see you later,,36:08.0,36:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12385,5,1,T2 ,,,36:09.0,56:27.0,20:18.0,,,,,,
12386,5,1,T2 ,,all right,36:09.0,36:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12387,5,1,T2 ,,,36:09.0,37:12.0,01:03.0,,,,,,
12388,5,1,T2 ,all right let's get this done and over with,,36:10.0,36:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12389,5,1,T2 ,all right pause filler you have to teach me how to use this problem because I have no idea what I'm doing,,36:15.0,36:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,SD
12390,5,1,T2 ,,okay so you have the x here,36:20.0,36:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12391,5,1,T2 ,,the idea is you want to leave that x alone and don't touch it,36:27.0,36:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12392,5,1,T2 ,,you want to actually add three to this three so,36:31.0,36:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12393,5,1,T2 ,what if I heard this before,,36:37.0,36:42.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12394,5,1,T2 ,,so yeah you pause filler add three,36:42.0,36:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12395,5,1,T2 ,,and that gets you zero,36:45.0,36:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12396,5,1,T2 ,,and yeah so then you know what to do from here right,36:49.0,36:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12397,5,1,T2 ,pause filler maybe I'll check later,,36:53.0,36:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12398,5,1,T2 ,,all right yeah so show me what you know,36:56.0,36:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12399,5,1,T2 ,all right so pause filler basically what I get twenty-five,,36:59.0,37:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12400,5,1,T2 ,and then I'm done,,37:03.0,37:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12401,5,1,T2 ,,yeah twenty-five equals x,37:05.0,37:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12402,5,1,T2 ,,. that is good,37:06.0,37:07.0,00:01.0,,,LP,,,
12403,5,1,T2 ,,I'm going to put a checkmark yay,37:07.0,37:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12404,5,1,T2 ,all right we did it,,37:10.0,37:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12405,5,1,T2 ,oh what page,,37:12.0,37:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12406,5,1,T2 ,,,37:14.0,39:49.0,02:35.0,,,,,,
12407,5,1,T2 ,,okay so see if you do another one like this again,37:14.0,37:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12408,5,1,T2 ,all right but this one we haven't done before,,37:20.0,37:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12409,5,1,T2 ,do you know how to do this one,,37:26.0,37:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12410,5,1,T2 ,,yeah,37:27.0,37:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12411,5,1,T2 ,all right so tell me,,37:28.0,37:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12412,5,1,T2 ,oh I went into full screen,,37:30.0,37:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12413,5,1,T2 ,(laughter) all right I'm good now,,37:34.0,37:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12414,5,1,T2 ,,all right,37:38.0,37:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12415,5,1,T2 ,,so wait,37:41.0,37:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12416,5,1,T2 ,,okay yeah all right,37:46.0,37:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12417,5,1,T2 ,,let's go,37:48.0,37:53.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12418,5,1,T2 ,,you're going to go,37:54.0,37:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12419,5,1,T2 ,we didn't do this one yet,,37:56.0,37:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12420,5,1,T2 ,so you have to touch me how to do it,,37:58.0,37:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12421,5,1,T2 ,,all right all right,37:59.0,38:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12422,5,1,T2 ,I know how to do it but (inaudible),,38:00.0,38:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,SD
12423,5,1,T2 ,,okay so,38:02.0,38:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12424,5,1,T2 ,we have to do it,,38:04.0,38:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12425,5,1,T2 ,I'm sorry,,38:05.0,38:05.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12426,5,1,T2 ,,so for this you want the y to be positive,38:06.0,38:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12427,5,1,T2 ,,so you're actually going to add a y to the y okay,38:09.0,38:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12428,5,1,T2 ,,I'll (inaudible) for a second,38:13.0,38:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12429,5,1,T2 ,,and here you're also going to subtract the eighteen,38:16.0,38:21.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12430,5,1,T2 ,,so you can do that,38:21.0,38:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12431,5,1,T2 ,,so whenever you have like one positive number without positive or negative the idea is to get you want to add the opposite of that,38:25.0,38:35.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
12432,5,1,T2 ,,so you actually want to subtract eighteen from the eighteen,38:36.0,38:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12433,5,1,T2 ,,and get zero,38:40.0,38:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12434,5,1,T2 ,,but then you'd also going to subtract that eighteen from the twenty-three,38:41.0,38:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12435,5,1,T2 ,actually I think what you do pause filler is that you'd subtract the twenty-three,,38:47.0,38:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12436,5,1,T2 ,not the eighteen,,38:54.0,38:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12437,5,1,T2 ,because you want to get y on this side,,38:56.0,38:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12438,5,1,T2 ,right,,38:59.0,39:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12439,5,1,T2 ,,yeah,39:01.0,39:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12440,5,1,T2 ,oh all right yeah,,39:02.0,39:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12441,5,1,T2 ,and then you do that,,39:03.0,39:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12442,5,1,T2 ,and then you did twenty-three,,39:05.0,39:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12443,5,1,T2 ,and then you'd minus twenty-three,,39:08.0,39:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12444,5,1,T2 ,ops that's a two,,39:10.0,39:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12445,5,1,T2 ,all right and then op,,39:11.0,39:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12446,5,1,T2 ,then this is what my homework looks like so (laughter),,39:15.0,39:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12447,5,1,T2 ,,so you do that,39:19.0,39:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12448,5,1,T2 ,yeah pause filler and then you get negative five,,39:21.0,39:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12449,5,1,T2 ,and then you get y,,39:24.0,39:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12450,5,1,T2 ,and then that's what it equals,,39:27.0,39:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12451,5,1,T2 ,,all right yeah that's good,39:29.0,39:31.0,00:02.0,,,LP,,,
12452,5,1,T2 ,,go with,39:32.0,39:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12453,5,1,T2 ,I mean,,39:33.0,39:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12454,5,1,T2 ,oh my god,,39:33.0,39:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12455,5,1,T2 ,what is that a v,,39:35.0,39:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12456,5,1,T2 ,,it's supposed to be a checkmark,39:36.0,39:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12457,5,1,T2 ,,it's not like the pencil where mine just keep drawing out,39:38.0,39:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12458,5,1,T2 ,,here we go,39:41.0,39:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12459,5,1,T2 ,oh there you go,,39:42.0,39:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12460,5,1,T2 ,there you got it,,39:43.0,39:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12461,5,1,T2 ,,to complete checkmark thing all right,39:44.0,39:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12462,5,1,T2 ,,oh wow,39:50.0,39:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12463,5,1,T2 ,,,39:51.0,41:53.0,02:02.0,,,,,,
12464,5,1,T2 ,,okay let's see with this one now,39:51.0,39:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12465,5,1,T2 ,,so here it's going to be confusing because now you have two variables and two numbers pause filler on different sides,39:55.0,40:04.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
12466,5,1,T2 ,,so one of the first things you actually want to do is you want to add k to both sides,40:04.0,40:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12467,5,1,T2 ,,so yeah each k is going to receive a k,40:10.0,40:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12468,5,1,T2 ,,and the positive k is going to become two k you know,40:16.0,40:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12469,5,1,T2 ,ah yeah like has a y2k robot is taking over right yeah,,40:20.0,40:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12470,5,1,T2 ,,yeah yeah stuff like that,40:26.0,40:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12471,5,1,T2 ,yeah,,40:29.0,40:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12472,5,1,T2 ,,and so you can go ahead,40:30.0,40:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12473,5,1,T2 ,,and can do that,40:32.0,40:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12474,5,1,T2 ,oh what not a two,,40:34.0,40:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12475,5,1,T2 ,I don't want a two,,40:36.0,40:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12476,5,1,T2 ,,pause filler hitting undo in this thing is so hard,40:42.0,40:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12477,5,1,T2 ,pause filler it's easy for me,,40:45.0,40:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12478,5,1,T2 ,you just got to get used to it,,40:47.0,40:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12479,5,1,T2 ,,yeah,40:48.0,40:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12480,5,1,T2 ,pause filler and then you get two k,,40:50.0,40:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12481,5,1,T2 ,well that was like I've been drawing like perfect ks,,40:53.0,40:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12482,5,1,T2 ,I'm on a streak,,40:55.0,40:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12483,5,1,T2 ,so then what I do is minus thirty-six,,40:57.0,41:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12484,5,1,T2 ,,that's right,41:00.0,41:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12485,5,1,T2 ,minus thirty-six,,41:02.0,41:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12486,5,1,T2 ,and then that would be negative fifty equals two k and then two k,,41:07.0,41:15.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
12487,5,1,T2 ,but not the k I don't want that so,,41:16.0,41:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12488,5,1,T2 ,and then you divide that by two,,41:19.0,41:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12489,5,1,T2 ,but then two divided by fifty,,41:21.0,41:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12490,5,1,T2 ,pause filler two four pause filler,,41:26.0,41:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12491,5,1,T2 ,,twenty-five,41:30.0,41:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12492,5,1,T2 ,oh yeah I forgot,,41:35.0,41:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12493,5,1,T2 ,twenty-five,,41:38.0,41:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12494,5,1,T2 ,and then k equals twenty-five,,41:39.0,41:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12495,5,1,T2 ,,yeah yeah that's correct,41:46.0,41:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12496,5,1,T2 ,,all right so we got this page down,41:50.0,41:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12497,5,1,T2 ,,,41:54.0,42:35.0,00:41.0,,,,,,
12498,5,1,T2 ,,all right,41:54.0,41:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12499,5,1,T2 ,,oh my gosh,41:56.0,41:56.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12500,5,1,T2 ,,this is really hard to do,41:56.0,41:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12501,5,1,T2 ,,okay,42:00.0,42:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12502,5,1,T2 ,all right this is basically like the same thing before it's like I flipped it around,,42:01.0,42:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12503,5,1,T2 ,,yeah so let's see if you can do this without my instruction,42:05.0,42:17.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
12504,5,1,T2 ,all right let's do it,,42:17.0,42:25.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
12505,5,1,T2 ,(sfx) there one,,42:26.0,42:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12506,5,1,T2 ,,yeah there we go,42:30.0,42:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12507,5,1,T2 ,,so yeah b equals two,42:33.0,42:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12508,5,1,T2 ,,that's good,42:36.0,42:36.0,00:00.0,,,LP,,,
12509,5,1,T2 ,,I'm going to fix that real quickly,42:38.0,42:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

12514,5,1,T2 ,all right five,,42:44.0,42:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12515,5,1,T2 ,all right nine wait hold on it's like the (inaudible) could just like skip the page if he doesn't want to do it,,42:46.0,42:53.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12516,5,1,T2 ,that's sweet anyway all right,,42:53.0,42:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12517,5,1,T2 ,,that's is cool,42:56.0,42:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12518,5,1,T2 ,all right so all right,,42:58.0,42:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12519,5,1,T2 ,,you know how to do this one right or do you not,43:00.0,43:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12520,5,1,T2 ,I know how to do it,,43:03.0,43:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12521,5,1,T2 ,but you need to like teach me because this one is new,,43:04.0,43:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12522,5,1,T2 ,,all right so here you have negative nine g equals eighty-one,43:07.0,43:13.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12523,5,1,T2 ,,so for you I would pause filler yeah you want to separate the negative nine and the g,43:13.0,43:20.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12524,5,1,T2 ,,so what you're going to do is actually you're going to add nine to you should,43:21.0,43:28.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12525,5,1,T2 ,what,,43:28.0,43:28.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12526,5,1,T2 ,,you're going to add nine to each of these,43:28.0,43:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12527,5,1,T2 ,,no you can add nine to the negative nine,43:30.0,43:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12528,5,1,T2 ,,and then divide a positive nine by the eighty-one,43:32.0,43:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12529,5,1,T2 ,all right,,43:36.0,43:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12530,5,1,T2 ,that sounds pretty pause filler cool,,43:38.0,43:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12531,5,1,T2 ,and then,,43:50.0,43:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12532,5,1,T2 ,I'm done,,43:56.0,43:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12533,5,1,T2 ,,all right that's good,43:59.0,44:00.0,00:01.0,,,LP,,,
12534,5,1,T2 ,,and here we go,44:00.0,44:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12535,5,1,T2 ,,it looks sort of like a checkmark,44:05.0,44:15.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
12536,5,1,T2 ,yeah,,44:15.0,44:15.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12537,5,1,T2 ,,all right,44:15.0,44:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12538,5,1,T2 ,,,44:19.0,45:43.0,01:24.0,,,,,,
12539,5,1,T2 ,,so we've already done this right,44:19.0,44:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12540,5,1,T2 ,,let me see,44:21.0,44:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12541,5,1,T2 ,,yeah we've done something sort of like it,44:26.0,44:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12542,5,1,T2 ,,but it's still a little bit different,44:28.0,44:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12543,5,1,T2 ,,so here you have the tenth,44:32.0,44:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12544,5,1,T2 ,,and you actually want to get right of that ten,44:37.0,44:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12545,5,1,T2 ,,so we should go,44:39.0,44:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12546,5,1,T2 ,,and take away ten from the ten,44:41.0,44:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12547,5,1,T2 ,,but also from the eighty-two,44:44.0,44:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12548,5,1,T2 ,,so you can get started on that,44:49.0,44:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12549,5,1,T2 ,all right,,44:52.0,44:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12550,5,1,T2 ,so minus that's not a minus,,44:55.0,44:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12551,5,1,T2 ,minus ten minus ten pause filler,,45:01.0,45:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12552,5,1,T2 ,,yeah,45:07.0,45:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12553,5,1,T2 ,oh no it's wrong,,45:09.0,45:18.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
12554,5,1,T2 ,,not yet,45:18.0,45:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12555,5,1,T2 ,and then eight eight y equals seven oh,,45:21.0,45:30.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
12556,5,1,T2 ,,wow,45:31.0,45:31.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12557,5,1,T2 ,y equals seven,,45:36.0,45:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12558,5,1,T2 ,,there we go,45:41.0,45:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12559,5,1,T2 ,,okay I don't,45:47.0,45:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

12563,5,1,T2 ,,yeah yeah,45:59.0,45:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12564,5,1,T2 ,,,45:59.0,50:10.0,04:11.0,,,,,,
12565,5,1,T2 ,that was actually really good,,45:59.0,46:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12566,5,1,T2 ,all right no page seven all right,,46:00.0,46:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12567,5,1,T2 ,,oh we went up two pages,46:05.0,46:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12568,5,1,T2 ,,I didn't notice that,46:06.0,46:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12569,5,1,T2 ,,so this one is sort of the same,46:09.0,46:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12570,5,1,T2 ,,pause filler yeah,46:13.0,46:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12571,5,1,T2 ,yeah but except this is a fourteen x,,46:15.0,46:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12572,5,1,T2 ,how do I multiply that (laughter),,46:18.0,46:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12573,5,1,T2 ,,so (inaudible),46:20.0,46:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12574,5,1,T2 ,twenty-five,,46:21.0,46:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12575,5,1,T2 ,,yeah let's see,46:24.0,46:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12576,5,1,T2 ,,this is so this is a positive sixty-five,46:26.0,46:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12577,5,1,T2 ,,you're going to get rid of a sixty-five,46:29.0,46:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12578,5,1,T2 ,,and also take away sixty-five from the one hundred seven,46:31.0,46:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12579,5,1,T2 ,,I need to figure out what that is now,46:37.0,46:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12580,5,1,T2 ,,that would be,46:40.0,46:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12581,5,1,T2 ,,oh well,46:45.0,46:45.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12582,5,1,T2 ,,so sixty plus forty is a hundred okay okay,46:49.0,46:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12583,5,1,T2 ,remember you shouldn't be doing this for me,,46:52.0,46:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12584,5,1,T2 ,,right I also want to get the answer like before you do,46:54.0,47:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12585,5,1,T2 ,,so I make sure you get the right answer,47:00.0,47:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12586,5,1,T2 ,yeah,,47:02.0,47:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

12600,5,1,T2 ,,and so you have the fourteen x right now,47:42.0,47:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12601,5,1,T2 ,,it's stationary,47:45.0,47:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12602,5,1,T2 ,,this does nothing for now,47:47.0,47:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12603,5,1,T2 ,,and you're also going to get rid of that,47:49.0,47:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12604,5,1,T2 ,,so you can go ahead,47:51.0,47:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

12630,5,1,T2 ,no I'm just kidding all right,,49:04.0,49:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12631,5,1,T2 ,so pause filler so basically x equals,,49:06.0,49:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12632,5,1,T2 ,pause filler forty-two over fourteen,,49:14.0,49:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12633,5,1,T2 ,that's negative all right,,49:16.0,49:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12634,5,1,T2 ,,actually you can still simplify this,49:20.0,49:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12635,5,1,T2 ,really,,49:24.0,49:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

12637,5,1,T2 ,,and add another fourteen,49:30.0,49:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12638,5,1,T2 ,,and you get forty-two,49:31.0,49:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12639,5,1,T2 ,oh pause filler so wouldn't be that,,49:38.0,49:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12640,5,1,T2 ,,well that answer is correct,49:42.0,49:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12641,5,1,T2 ,,but to fully simplify you would have pause filler,49:45.0,49:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12642,5,1,T2 ,,three,49:48.0,49:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12643,5,1,T2 ,,right,49:48.0,49:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12644,5,1,T2 ,,or is it negative,49:49.0,49:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12645,5,1,T2 ,it would be negative because,,49:53.0,49:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12646,5,1,T2 ,,yeah that's right,49:57.0,49:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12647,5,1,T2 ,,negative plus negative is a positive,49:58.0,49:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12648,5,1,T2 ,,so yeah that's either way would be correct,50:02.0,50:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12649,5,1,T2 ,yeah so,,50:09.0,50:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

12686,5,1,T2 ,so twenty-five equals nine negative,,52:14.0,52:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12687,5,1,T2 ,,there we go,52:18.0,52:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12688,5,1,T2 ,,correct again,52:20.0,52:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12689,5,1,T2 ,,,52:23.0,54:35.0,02:12.0,,,,,,
12690,5,1,T2 ,,all right well this looks new,52:23.0,52:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12691,5,1,T2 ,yeah,,52:26.0,52:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12692,5,1,T2 ,,I'm going to have to review this in a few seconds all right,52:27.0,52:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12693,5,1,T2 ,,so before you would just have like you could have like negative p minus it to eight minus p,52:32.0,52:41.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
12694,5,1,T2 ,,but now you actually have you do have ps,52:42.0,52:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12695,5,1,T2 ,,but now one of the p is was an eight,52:46.0,52:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12696,5,1,T2 ,,so what you're going to do to this number here and the p here is each of those will receive their very own p,52:49.0,52:58.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
12697,5,1,T2 ,,so that's right yeah okay,52:59.0,53:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12698,5,1,T2 ,wait the sixteen gets on the variable,,53:05.0,53:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12699,5,1,T2 ,,wait is this (inaudible),53:09.0,53:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12700,5,1,T2 ,,yeah or this might actually be a typo,53:16.0,53:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12701,5,1,T2 ,,let's see,53:18.0,53:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12702,5,1,T2 ,no there's no way the sixteen could get a p of a variable,,53:20.0,53:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12703,5,1,T2 ,that's impossible,,53:24.0,53:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12704,5,1,T2 ,,oh okay they did it in a way where I could not understand it,53:30.0,53:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12705,5,1,T2 ,,the eight p receives so it becomes nine p,53:35.0,53:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12706,5,1,T2 ,yeah like these college students are weird,,53:40.0,53:43.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
12707,5,1,T2 ,,yeah because they're saying like add five y plus six to the six which we actually really mean to the five y,53:43.0,53:52.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
12708,5,1,T2 ,,so I don't really understand why they're explaining it like that because it makes no sense,53:54.0,53:59.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12709,5,1,T2 ,good god,,54:06.0,54:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12710,5,1,T2 ,I get thirty-six pause filler,,54:14.0,54:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12711,5,1,T2 ,and then the p would equal four because I said so,,54:20.0,54:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12712,5,1,T2 ,all right let's go,,54:24.0,54:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12713,5,1,T2 ,,yup,54:26.0,54:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12714,5,1,T2 ,,there we go,54:35.0,54:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12715,5,1,T2 ,,,54:36.0,56:18.0,01:42.0,,,,,,
12716,5,1,T2 ,,so yeah this is kind of like the same thing,54:36.0,54:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12717,5,1,T2 ,,but yet now you need to subtract them right,54:42.0,54:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12718,5,1,T2 ,oh,,54:46.0,54:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12719,5,1,T2 ,,no you're going to add w to both sides again,54:46.0,54:52.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12720,5,1,T2 ,,so let's see,54:53.0,54:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12721,5,1,T2 ,,let's see this,54:56.0,54:56.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

12772,5,2,S1 ,and it's going to be like,,00:25.0,00:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12773,5,2,S1 ,all right so the way Pittsburgh started yo,,00:27.0,00:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12774,5,2,S1 ,it was just like so this brick bitch guy who just like,,00:30.0,00:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

12781,5,2,S1 ,and I just started on this script,,00:44.0,00:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12782,5,2,S1 ,and it's going to be pretty good,,00:46.0,00:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12783,5,2,S1 ,,let's hope,00:48.0,00:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12784,5,2,S1 ,yeah if it gets like a million views I'm going to be so happy,,00:49.0,00:55.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12785,5,2,S1 ,,I think my highest number of views is twelve,00:56.0,00:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12786,5,2,S1 ,pause filler mine is pause filler one thousand,,01:00.0,01:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12787,5,2,S1 ,,(inaudible),01:06.0,01:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12788,5,2,S1 ,yeah that's a lot,,01:07.0,01:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12789,5,2,S1 ,,I got to start working on stuff,01:11.0,01:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12790,5,2,S1 ,yeah again,,01:13.0,01:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12791,5,2,S1 ,and my second was like at least three hundred views yeah,,01:15.0,01:22.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12792,5,2,S1 ,,that's actually like a pretty wide gap,01:22.0,01:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12793,5,2,S1 ,,three thousand and pause filler three hundred,01:25.0,01:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12794,5,2,S1 ,yeah it was only because I pause filler basically there's this video of this kid who was just banned from like a game that I play,,01:27.0,01:39.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
12795,5,2,S1 ,and like it was really famous across the website,,01:40.0,01:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12796,5,2,S1 ,and I got the video of him like swearing up the camera,,01:44.0,01:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12797,5,2,S1 ,it was so funny,,01:47.0,01:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12798,5,2,S1 ,and I got like a thousand views off,,01:49.0,01:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12799,5,2,S1 ,and I was like yes,,01:51.0,01:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12800,5,2,S1 ,,pause filler I got to figure out how to do some of that stuff so,01:54.0,01:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12801,5,2,S1 ,oh,,01:58.0,01:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12802,5,2,S1 ,there's other like for people like you like pause filler,,02:00.0,02:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12803,5,2,S1 ,there's many ways of creating videos and getting lots of views,,02:06.0,02:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12804,5,2,S1 ,somehow like you could pause filler talk about a guy who pause filler were a lot of things just happened to him,,02:11.0,02:18.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12805,5,2,S1 ,pause filler you can pull off a DramaAlert,,02:18.0,02:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12806,5,2,S1 ,you could pause filler you know him DramaAlert,,02:20.0,02:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12807,5,2,S1 ,,no,02:23.0,02:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12808,5,2,S1 ,he's basically just this guy on the internet that nobody likes,,02:24.0,02:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12809,5,2,S1 ,and he talks about YouTube news quote unquote,,02:28.0,02:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12810,5,2,S1 ,and he just overdramatizes everything on the website,,02:31.0,02:36.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12811,5,2,S1 ,so you can pull off a thing like that pause filler you can make anime music videos,,02:36.0,02:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12812,5,2,S1 ,,oh yeah,02:43.0,02:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12813,5,2,S1 ,,I think I was doing something like that a while ago,02:44.0,02:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12814,5,2,S1 ,,but I totally forgot about it,02:49.0,02:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12815,5,2,S1 ,yeah yeah it's something I don't really like,,02:51.0,02:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12816,5,2,S1 ,but it's what you people can do to get a lot of views somehow,,02:54.0,02:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12817,5,2,S1 ,but anyway there's pause filler you could try to be nice and original like me,,02:57.0,03:04.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12818,5,2,S1 ,but oh if that won't get you a lot of views because well because it's YouTube,,03:04.0,03:08.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12819,5,2,S1 ,you know there's pause filler what else pause filler,,03:08.0,03:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12820,5,2,S1 ,what's this thing that can get you a lot of views,,03:11.0,03:18.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12821,5,2,S1 ,oh yeah,,03:18.0,03:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12822,5,2,S1 ,game plays but that's like,,03:18.0,03:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12823,5,2,S1 ,you have to be like one in a hundred in order to get popular,,03:21.0,03:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12824,5,2,S1 ,,yeah,03:25.0,03:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12825,5,2,S1 ,yeah like you're only like you're either popular or not popular which is really bad about the YouTube system with that,,03:26.0,03:39.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
12826,5,2,S1 ,pause filler so I just hit three thousand views on my channel,,03:40.0,03:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12827,5,2,S1 ,so it's working on pretty well for me,,03:44.0,03:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12828,5,2,S1 ,and I have thirty-two subscribers,,03:47.0,03:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12829,5,2,S1 ,so it's going to it's probably going to start working out well soon,,03:50.0,03:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12830,5,2,S1 ,I just got to figure out a way to set up like a good video system,,03:55.0,03:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12831,5,2,S1 ,something that everyone likes which is,,03:59.0,04:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12832,5,2,S1 ,,it's really hard to figure what people want from you on YouTube,04:02.0,04:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12833,5,2,S1 ,yeah like I figured out that pause filler ranting about a bunch of pause filler random people actually works really well,,04:07.0,04:15.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
12834,5,2,S1 ,like those are series that I did for a little bit,,04:15.0,04:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12835,5,2,S1 ,it was called the Internet filth,,04:18.0,04:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12836,5,2,S1 ,and basically what I did is that I went onto like DeviantArt or YouTube,,04:20.0,04:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12837,5,2,S1 ,and I just like ranted on like a bunch of like I don't know crap that they drew or something or pause filler or about like what they what kind of ideas they post,,04:25.0,04:38.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
12838,5,2,S1 ,and I'm not sure if you're aware of the Five Nights Of Freddy's Phantom,,04:39.0,04:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12839,5,2,S1 ,but there was this guy named pause filler Smike,,04:43.0,04:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12840,5,2,S1 ,and what he did is that he basically just made a bunch of top tens about like the characters,,04:49.0,04:55.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12841,5,2,S1 ,and it was basically like every single one of those videos and,,04:55.0,04:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,

12858,5,2,T1 ,because there might have been some sudden change that I'm not aware about,,07:10.0,07:14.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
12859,5,2,T1 ,so I just got to get the green pen,,07:14.0,07:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12860,5,2,T1 ,,,07:17.0,09:33.0,02:16.0,,,,,,

12862,5,2,T1 ,,sort of,07:21.0,07:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12863,5,2,T1 ,basically all you have to do is multiply one of these numbers to the other side,,07:23.0,07:31.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
12864,5,2,T1 ,,all right wouldn't that be the three over seven,07:33.0,07:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12865,5,2,T1 ,yeah,,07:37.0,07:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12866,5,2,T1 ,,okay,07:38.0,07:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12867,5,2,T1 ,but what do you do once you pause filler get the three over seven onto the other side,,07:40.0,07:46.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12868,5,2,T1 ,,,07:47.0,07:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12869,5,2,T1 ,,you multiply it by four over one,07:47.0,07:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12870,5,2,T1 ,forty over one,,07:51.0,07:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12871,5,2,T1 ,,yeah that's right so we'll do that,07:53.0,07:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12872,5,2,T1 ,,,07:53.0,07:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12873,5,2,T1 ,,,07:58.0,08:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

12878,5,2,T1 ,all right,,08:13.0,08:19.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
12879,5,2,T1 ,,so I got to simplify that,08:19.0,08:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12880,5,2,T1 ,,,08:19.0,08:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

12882,5,2,T1 ,,,08:25.0,08:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12883,5,2,T1 ,,so we'll do a quick division thing over here,08:25.0,08:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
12884,5,2,T1 ,yeah you know what this should be really good for,,08:30.0,08:45.0,00:15.0,SV,,,,,

12946,5,2,T1 ,I'm afraid of sitting here now,,13:09.0,13:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12947,5,2,T1 ,and all right here comes the best part,,13:11.0,13:17.0,00:06.0,SV,,,,,
12948,5,2,T1 ,so once we and dad were going to another street corner so we could easily be picked up like,,13:17.0,13:22.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,
12949,5,2,T1 ,we saw a bunch of police officers (laughter),,13:23.0,13:25.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
12950,5,2,T1 ,no this is like going where you think it's going all right but,,13:28.0,13:32.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
12951,5,2,T1 ,pause filler there's just a bunch of police cars over here,,13:32.0,13:34.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
12952,5,2,T1 ,they're like three in a row all right,,13:34.0,13:37.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
12953,5,2,T1 ,,why,13:37.0,13:37.0,00:00.0,,SV,,,,
12954,5,2,T1 ,I don't know,,13:38.0,13:39.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
12955,5,2,T1 ,but I decided to make a joke,,13:39.0,13:41.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
12956,5,2,T1 ,because a lot of them were like wearing like short skirts,,13:41.0,13:46.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,
12957,5,2,T1 ,and I was like hey that's not eww that's wow,,13:46.0,13:50.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
12958,5,2,T1 ,and I was like I told you the weeaboo prostitutes were out tonight,,13:50.0,13:57.0,00:07.0,SV,,,,,
12959,5,2,T1 ,that's what I said to my dad,,13:57.0,13:59.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
12960,5,2,T1 ,and he was like well you're right Jordan,,13:59.0,14:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12961,5,2,T1 ,I'm like yes,,14:04.0,14:05.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
12962,5,2,T1 ,because it was so funny,,14:06.0,14:09.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
12963,5,2,T1 ,like I knew this would happened like sometime at that night,,14:09.0,14:13.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
12964,5,2,T1 ,,jeez Pittsburgh is getting weird and fast,14:14.0,14:18.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
12965,5,2,T1 ,no it's just like Pittsburgh had like and that's what I'm doing in my pause filler like abridged Pittsburgh history,,14:19.0,14:27.0,00:08.0,SV,,,,,
12966,5,2,T1 ,and then it's like basically nothing really happens from the thirtys to two thousands,,14:27.0,14:32.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,
12967,5,2,T1 ,until the furries came and ruined everything for us,,14:32.0,14:35.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
12968,5,2,T1 ,and every time that like a furry or anything related comes to this town I get severely afraid so,,14:35.0,14:42.0,00:07.0,SV,,,,,
12969,5,2,T1 ,and then I made like this short segment where I made an open letter to the furries and anything related,,14:43.0,14:49.0,00:06.0,SV,,,,,
12970,5,2,T1 ,,furries those things are kind of creepy if you think about it,14:50.0,14:53.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
12971,5,2,T1 ,they're even creepier if you go onto the Internet,,14:53.0,14:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12972,5,2,T1 ,like if you are a true a larker like me you furries are like weirder than they are in a costume,,14:56.0,15:09.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
12973,5,2,T1 ,like I don't think you'd understand because,,15:10.0,15:13.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
12974,5,2,T1 ,,,15:13.0,19:15.0,04:02.0,,,,,,
12975,5,2,T1 ,all right so let's get back on topic to see what you're doing here,,15:13.0,15:18.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,
12976,5,2,T1 ,because I'm getting really curious,,15:18.0,15:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12977,5,2,T1 ,all right so what you did is you add it onto that,,15:19.0,15:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12978,5,2,T1 ,and you got seventy right,,15:22.0,15:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12979,5,2,T1 ,,yeah,15:24.0,15:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
12980,5,2,T1 ,and then what's this,,15:26.0,15:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12981,5,2,T1 ,,that is y I messed it up pretty badly,15:31.0,15:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12982,5,2,T1 ,why did you put a y there,,15:35.0,15:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12983,5,2,T1 ,,pause filler because you're supposed to multiply the ys right,15:38.0,15:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12984,5,2,T1 ,,,15:38.0,15:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12985,5,2,T1 ,,,15:40.0,15:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12986,5,2,T1 ,,because you multiply y here,15:40.0,15:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12987,5,2,T1 ,,and the y would cancel out,15:43.0,15:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12988,5,2,T1 ,,,15:43.0,15:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12989,5,2,T1 ,,and those two multiply on this side,15:45.0,15:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12990,5,2,T1 ,,,15:45.0,15:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
12991,5,2,T1 ,,,15:47.0,15:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12992,5,2,T1 ,,and maybe you just add y seventy,15:47.0,15:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12993,5,2,T1 ,pause filler right so pause filler what you do is that correct,,15:50.0,15:57.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
12994,5,2,T1 ,no,,15:57.0,15:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12995,5,2,T1 ,oh my goodness,,16:01.0,16:06.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12996,5,2,T1 ,all right so one hundred and forty over three,,16:06.0,16:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
12997,5,2,T1 ,and then you're dividing three by one hundred four,,16:12.0,16:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
12998,5,2,T1 ,and four divided by three,,16:15.0,16:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
12999,5,2,T1 ,all right do what you're doing there here,,16:16.0,16:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13000,5,2,T1 ,,where,16:21.0,16:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13001,5,2,T1 ,pause filler this,,16:22.0,16:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13002,5,2,T1 ,,,16:25.0,16:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13003,5,2,T1 ,,oh okay so that's twenty,16:25.0,16:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13004,5,2,T1 ,,I can get this eighty well this nine eight,16:31.0,16:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13005,5,2,T1 ,,,16:31.0,16:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13006,5,2,T1 ,,I'm not good at drawing in small spaces,16:38.0,16:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13007,5,2,T1 ,,there we're going to leave it there,16:42.0,16:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13008,5,2,T1 ,,,16:45.0,16:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13009,5,2,T1 ,,and we're going to have a left over two,16:45.0,16:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13010,5,2,T1 ,,you can't even really see it from here,16:50.0,16:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13011,5,2,T1 ,,because the bar down here blocks it,16:51.0,16:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13012,5,2,T1 ,what bar,,16:54.0,16:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13013,5,2,T1 ,,there's a bar that moves the screen side to side,16:55.0,17:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13014,5,2,T1 ,oh pause filler I don't have it,,17:02.0,17:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13015,5,2,T1 ,,mine does,17:05.0,17:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13016,5,2,T1 ,oh pause filler ah weird pause filler,,17:07.0,17:13.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13017,5,2,T1 ,I don't even have a scroller,,17:14.0,17:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13018,5,2,T1 ,,actually now I do not have one either,17:15.0,17:21.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13019,5,2,T1 ,,ah that is odd pause filler,17:22.0,17:29.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13020,5,2,T1 ,pause filler well can you fit the rest of the problem there,,17:34.0,17:51.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
13021,5,2,T1 ,,no I have no space to write,17:54.0,17:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13022,5,2,T1 ,well I do,,17:57.0,17:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13023,5,2,T1 ,,that's weird,17:59.0,17:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13024,5,2,T1 ,see,,18:00.0,18:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13025,5,2,T1 ,,,18:00.0,18:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13026,5,2,T1 ,,I'm going to move it over here and have the twenty,18:00.0,18:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13027,5,2,T1 ,wait wait wait there,,18:07.0,18:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13028,5,2,T1 ,,okay so we're going to have the twenty over here,18:10.0,18:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13029,5,2,T1 ,,,18:10.0,18:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13030,5,2,T1 ,,and then minus the eighteen,18:16.0,18:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13031,5,2,T1 ,,,18:16.0,18:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13032,5,2,T1 ,no that's infinite pause filler,,18:19.0,18:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13033,5,2,T1 ,,,18:21.0,18:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13034,5,2,T1 ,,yeah so then you would have two over three because,18:21.0,18:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13035,5,2,T1 ,you'd put the line over the three,,18:24.0,18:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13036,5,2,T1 ,,no but wouldn't that be with decimals,18:29.0,18:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13037,5,2,T1 ,oh that yeah that would be with decimals,,18:33.0,18:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13038,5,2,T1 ,but oh wait I'm totally lost here now,,18:35.0,18:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13039,5,2,T1 ,,,18:35.0,18:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13040,5,2,T1 ,,,18:41.0,18:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13041,5,2,T1 ,,yeah I'm a little confused,18:41.0,18:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13042,5,2,T1 ,,I think if it's infinite you just put like two over three to show that it can never be simplified to a whole number,18:43.0,18:50.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13043,5,2,T1 ,,,18:43.0,18:50.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13044,5,2,T1 ,yeah so that's what I was thinking,,18:50.0,18:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13045,5,2,T1 ,so just write the,,18:52.0,18:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13046,5,2,T1 ,,,18:55.0,19:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13047,5,2,T1 ,,yeah so in the end I got like negative forty-six to over three equalsy,18:55.0,19:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13048,5,2,T1 ,all right,,19:00.0,19:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13049,5,2,T1 ,,okay,19:03.0,19:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13050,5,2,T1 ,all right (inaudible) but that's over right,,19:04.0,19:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13051,5,2,T1 ,all right pause filler,,19:07.0,19:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13052,5,2,T1 ,that's a really good checkmark,,19:09.0,19:13.0,00:04.0,,,,LPP,,
13053,5,2,T1 ,,yeah all right,19:13.0,19:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13054,5,2,T1 ,,okay,19:15.0,19:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13055,5,2,T1 ,,,19:16.0,21:38.0,02:22.0,,,,,,
13056,5,2,T1 ,all right what you do is you subtract thirteen basically,,19:17.0,19:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13057,5,2,T1 ,because this is a plus you see,,19:23.0,19:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13058,5,2,T1 ,,,19:23.0,19:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13059,5,2,T1 ,,yeah,19:26.0,19:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13060,5,2,T1 ,yeah,,19:28.0,19:28.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13061,5,2,T1 ,,so well technically what I could just do here is that I can just wipe whoa I can just wipe about the thirteen and then,19:29.0,19:37.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
13062,5,2,T1 ,,,19:29.0,19:37.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
13063,5,2,T1 ,,oh why is that weird,19:37.0,19:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13064,5,2,T1 ,,,19:39.0,19:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13065,5,2,T1 ,,and I can just turn the forty-four into a thirty-one,19:39.0,19:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13066,5,2,T1 ,,that saves up a whole lot of room,19:46.0,19:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13067,5,2,T1 ,indeed,,19:48.0,19:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13068,5,2,T1 ,,I want to redo that and pause filler,19:54.0,19:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13069,5,2,T1 ,,,19:54.0,19:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13070,5,2,T1 ,,okay no give me my two,19:58.0,20:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13071,5,2,T1 ,,there we go there there okay,20:01.0,20:07.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13072,5,2,T1 ,,stay there,20:07.0,20:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13073,5,2,T1 ,,now we need to multiply the x,20:09.0,20:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13074,5,2,T1 ,,,20:09.0,20:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13075,5,2,T1 ,,so technically we would get one over two would equal thirty,20:14.0,20:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13076,5,2,T1 ,,,20:14.0,20:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13077,5,2,T1 ,,,20:23.0,20:30.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13078,5,2,T1 ,,yeah so now we have to bring the thirty-one over to the one over two and multiply that to get the,20:23.0,20:30.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13079,5,2,T1 ,pause filler hold on,,20:32.0,20:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13080,5,2,T1 ,all right you got thirty-one over two right,,20:33.0,20:42.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
13081,5,2,T1 ,,yeah,20:42.0,20:42.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13082,5,2,T1 ,yeah,,20:43.0,20:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13083,5,2,T1 ,,so then fifteen one over two,20:44.0,20:53.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
13084,5,2,T1 ,,,20:44.0,20:53.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
13085,5,2,T1 ,,,20:53.0,20:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13086,5,2,T1 ,,because you got one left,20:53.0,20:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13087,5,2,T1 ,,well gave me an extra line,20:55.0,20:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13088,5,2,T1 ,,just give me that,21:01.0,21:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13089,5,2,T1 ,,there,21:04.0,21:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13090,5,2,T1 ,pause filler oh my god I'm so tired,,21:04.0,21:12.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
13091,5,2,T1 ,pause filler fifteen and a half correct,,21:12.0,21:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13092,5,2,T1 ,well,,21:20.0,21:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13093,5,2,T1 ,all right all right,,21:20.0,21:38.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
13094,5,2,T1 ,oh my gosh,,21:38.0,21:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13095,5,2,T1 ,,,21:42.0,27:48.0,06:06.0,,,,,,
13096,5,2,T1 ,I'm sick of these problems please,,21:42.0,21:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13097,5,2,T1 ,,I know,21:45.0,21:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13098,5,2,T1 ,,so eliminate that,21:46.0,21:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13099,5,2,T1 ,,,21:46.0,21:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13100,5,2,T1 ,,,21:48.0,21:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13101,5,2,T1 ,,we're just going to add sixteen,21:48.0,21:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13102,5,2,T1 ,,so that becomes forty-seven,21:50.0,21:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13103,5,2,T1 ,,,21:50.0,21:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13104,5,2,T1 ,,,21:59.0,22:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13105,5,2,T1 ,,so multiply the x,21:59.0,22:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13106,5,2,T1 ,,I'll move that down a little bit more,22:04.0,22:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13107,5,2,T1 ,,well that's weird equals,22:15.0,22:23.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
13108,5,2,T1 ,,oh jeez now I have to actually do some math,22:23.0,22:29.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13109,5,2,T1 ,,what's forty-seven times three,22:30.0,22:37.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13110,5,2,T1 ,pause filler,,22:35.0,22:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13111,5,2,T1 ,,,22:39.0,22:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13112,5,2,T1 ,,forty-seven ninety-four,22:39.0,22:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13113,5,2,T1 ,,no wait,22:48.0,22:53.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13114,5,2,T1 ,,,22:53.0,22:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13115,5,2,T1 ,,first we're actually multiplying forty-seven over one,22:53.0,22:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13116,5,2,T1 ,I'm going to pull out the calculator,,22:57.0,22:59.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
13117,5,2,T1 ,wait why didn't make,,23:01.0,23:03.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
13118,5,2,T1 ,oh you got to be kidding me,,23:04.0,23:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13119,5,2,T1 ,,I think they have like a lock on it,23:06.0,23:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13120,5,2,T1 ,oh no we can't cheat,,23:13.0,23:15.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
13121,5,2,T1 ,ding it all right,,23:15.0,23:16.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
13122,5,2,T1 ,,I was let me do it quickly,23:17.0,23:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13123,5,2,T1 ,,top there pause filler,23:25.0,23:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13124,5,2,T1 ,,,23:28.0,23:37.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
13125,5,2,T1 ,,twenty-one to twelve for one forty-one over six,23:28.0,23:37.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
13126,5,2,T1 ,with six all right,,23:39.0,23:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13127,5,2,T1 ,and then it's just six to the infinite,,23:43.0,23:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13128,5,2,T1 ,so that's what I get,,23:45.0,23:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13129,5,2,T1 ,,all right I'm going to see if this would work here well,23:51.0,24:06.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
13130,5,2,T1 ,,,24:08.0,24:18.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
13131,5,2,T1 ,,and this would be a two,24:08.0,24:18.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
13132,5,2,T1 ,,,24:19.0,24:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13133,5,2,T1 ,,so this should be two over six,24:19.0,24:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13134,5,2,T1 ,,,24:25.0,24:38.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
13135,5,2,T1 ,,so technically you would have twenty twenty-three,24:25.0,24:38.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
13136,5,2,T1 ,,all right that's what I get,24:39.0,24:58.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
13137,5,2,T1 ,pause filler let's see pause filler,,24:58.0,24:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13138,5,2,T1 ,I think (sfx),,25:05.0,25:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13139,5,2,T1 ,I don't see the sixty-one,,25:08.0,25:20.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
13140,5,2,T1 ,there should be a sixty-one in this problem,,25:21.0,25:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13141,5,2,T1 ,,okay let's see sixty plus sixty-one,25:26.0,25:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13142,5,2,T1 ,,,25:26.0,25:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13143,5,2,T1 ,because you see here this,,25:29.0,25:36.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13144,5,2,T1 ,,,25:29.0,25:36.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13145,5,2,T1 ,,yeah,25:36.0,25:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13146,5,2,T1 ,,,25:36.0,25:53.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
13147,5,2,T1 ,all right so whenever you whenever you multiply them both sides you got to do six over three,,25:36.0,25:53.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
13148,5,2,T1 ,and then six over three,,25:56.0,26:01.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13149,5,2,T1 ,and then you have one hundred eighty-six over three see,,26:01.0,26:12.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
13150,5,2,T1 ,,oh yeah,26:13.0,26:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13151,5,2,T1 ,so we might have to redo this problem all over again so here,,26:15.0,26:22.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13152,5,2,T1 ,I'll just erase it all all right,,26:22.0,26:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13153,5,2,T1 ,,okay,26:24.0,26:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13154,5,2,T1 ,oh I'm erasing the problem,,26:34.0,26:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13155,5,2,T1 ,dang it,,26:35.0,26:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13156,5,2,T1 ,oh my gosh,,27:06.0,27:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13157,5,2,T1 ,all right,,27:13.0,27:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13158,5,2,T1 ,all right,,27:23.0,27:29.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13159,5,2,T1 ,it's like a blank slate,,27:30.0,27:32.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
13160,5,2,T1 ,,,27:33.0,27:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13161,5,2,T1 ,,yeah so yeah so six times thirty-one,27:33.0,27:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13162,5,2,T1 ,six over three six over three times pause filler,,27:42.0,27:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13163,5,2,T1 ,,pause filler we're on the fifth,27:52.0,27:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

13441,5,2,T2 ,,,45:44.0,45:52.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
13442,5,2,T2 ,,you're going to multiply this problem by one over k,45:44.0,45:52.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
13443,5,2,T2 ,,and as you do that this actually nope hang on I messed up real quick (laughter),45:53.0,46:00.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13444,5,2,T2 ,,(inaudible) let me real quick so I don't forget where I'm at,46:00.0,46:07.0,00:07.0,,,,,,

13446,5,2,T2 ,,,46:07.0,46:11.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13447,5,2,T2 ,,to actually do that I would like to first start,46:12.0,46:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13448,5,2,T2 ,,this actually cancels it out,46:14.0,46:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13449,5,2,T2 ,,,46:14.0,46:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13450,5,2,T2 ,,,46:16.0,46:22.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13451,5,2,T2 ,,and then you would have four equals sixty-two k,46:16.0,46:22.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13452,5,2,T2 ,,,46:22.0,46:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13453,5,2,T2 ,,now you have to simplify it from there,46:22.0,46:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13454,5,2,T2 ,,and I'm going to let you do that,46:25.0,46:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

13456,5,2,T2 ,,yeah honestly having someone around your age teach you math helps out so much better than someone who's a lot older than you,46:32.0,46:39.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13457,5,2,T2 ,oh yeah because you know it's a kid,,46:40.0,46:43.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,

13480,5,2,T2 ,,because I don't have any decimal things or none before,47:36.0,47:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13481,5,2,T2 ,okay it's eighteen k equals eighteen,,47:39.0,47:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13482,5,2,T2 ,all right we did it yay ops,,47:41.0,47:42.0,00:01.0,,,,LPB,,
13483,5,2,T2 ,,oh there we go,47:42.0,47:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13484,5,2,T2 ,,now this one pause filler I'm going to give you a little pause filler sneak peak here in order to get this out pretty fast,47:44.0,47:58.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
13485,5,2,T2 ,,,47:44.0,50:59.0,03:15.0,,,,,,
13486,5,2,T2 ,,you're going to multiply each sides by y,47:58.0,48:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13487,5,2,T2 ,,,47:58.0,48:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13488,5,2,T2 ,,,48:01.0,48:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13489,5,2,T2 ,,so this y cancels out y,48:01.0,48:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13490,5,2,T2 ,,and you actually are going to add a y what y,48:03.0,48:10.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13491,5,2,T2 ,,,48:03.0,48:10.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13492,5,2,T2 ,no no,,48:11.0,48:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13493,5,2,T2 ,there,,48:11.0,48:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13494,5,2,T2 ,,yeah and then we're going to add y to the two ten,48:12.0,48:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13495,5,2,T2 ,,,48:12.0,48:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13496,5,2,T2 ,,so yeah wait yeah,48:18.0,48:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13497,5,2,T2 ,,so then you basically know what pause filler you get there,48:21.0,48:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13498,5,2,T2 ,,,48:26.0,48:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13499,5,2,T2 ,,and then all you need to do is just simplify the answer,48:26.0,48:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13500,5,2,T2 ,,oh okay,48:34.0,48:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13501,5,2,T2 ,I'm just using the highlighter,,48:37.0,48:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13502,5,2,T2 ,all right so wait,,48:38.0,48:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13503,5,2,T2 ,hold on,,48:40.0,48:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13504,5,2,T2 ,no I don't want to go in Scribblar,,48:43.0,48:50.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13505,5,2,T2 ,,(laughter),48:47.0,48:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13506,5,2,T2 ,all right please undo,,48:50.0,48:54.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
13507,5,2,T2 ,no apparently this is another glitch where it won't erase this,,48:58.0,49:03.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
13508,5,2,T2 ,so I'm just going to do that,,49:03.0,49:04.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
13509,5,2,T2 ,all right all right so I think what you're missing here is that,,49:04.0,49:10.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13510,5,2,T2 ,we have to put the y here and the negative fourteen there,,49:10.0,49:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13511,5,2,T2 ,,well actually if you would do that,49:15.0,49:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13512,5,2,T2 ,,,49:15.0,49:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13513,5,2,T2 ,,you would have fourteen y,49:18.0,49:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13514,5,2,T2 ,,,49:18.0,49:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13515,5,2,T2 ,,,49:20.0,49:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13516,5,2,T2 ,,but negative fourteen y was negative fourteen y,49:20.0,49:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13517,5,2,T2 ,oh,,49:24.0,49:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13518,5,2,T2 ,,,49:26.0,49:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13519,5,2,T2 ,,so if you were actually to multiply the ys here,49:26.0,49:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13520,5,2,T2 ,,,49:30.0,49:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13521,5,2,T2 ,,they would cancel out for some reason I do not know the whereabouts of,49:30.0,49:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13522,5,2,T2 ,,,49:35.0,49:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13523,5,2,T2 ,,and you just multiply it here,49:35.0,49:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13524,5,2,T2 ,,and you get y,49:37.0,49:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13525,5,2,T2 ,,,49:37.0,49:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13526,5,2,T2 ,all righty then pause filler,,49:38.0,49:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13527,5,2,T2 ,,only if it works,49:41.0,49:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13528,5,2,T2 ,,only if this explain to me why what happened,49:45.0,49:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13529,5,2,T2 ,,I would understand it better,49:48.0,49:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13530,5,2,T2 ,pause filler well these are college students,,49:52.0,49:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13531,5,2,T2 ,and they just rigged this up just for us,,49:53.0,49:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13532,5,2,T2 ,,yay,49:57.0,49:58.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
13533,5,2,T2 ,all right and then we put y here right,,49:58.0,50:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13534,5,2,T2 ,,yeah,50:02.0,50:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13535,5,2,T2 ,all right and then I do that's a perfect one,,50:03.0,50:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13536,5,2,T2 ,,yeah that actually is that's a pretty decent line,50:07.0,50:11.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13537,5,2,T2 ,,I don't see any curves or anything,50:11.0,50:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13538,5,2,T2 ,and then what you do here is negative fourteen negative fourteen,,50:17.0,50:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13539,5,2,T2 ,calculator calculator,,50:24.0,50:29.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
13540,5,2,T2 ,,honestly I don't even know the answer to this,50:29.0,50:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13541,5,2,T2 ,,but I do have a sort of answer to it,50:32.0,50:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13542,5,2,T2 ,all right so it's two ten divided by four two,,50:37.0,50:42.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13543,5,2,T2 ,,negative fourteen,50:44.0,50:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13544,5,2,T2 ,so I got fifteen negative fifteen,,50:44.0,50:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13545,5,2,T2 ,,,50:47.0,50:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13546,5,2,T2 ,,yeah so you have negative fifteen equals y yeah,50:47.0,50:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13547,5,2,T2 ,oh yeah look at that,,50:53.0,50:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13548,5,2,T2 ,oh yeah oh (sfx),,50:55.0,50:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13549,5,2,T2 ,,,51:00.0,54:57.0,03:57.0,,,,,,
13550,5,2,T2 ,,okay,51:00.0,51:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13551,5,2,T2 ,all right all right,,51:02.0,51:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13552,5,2,T2 ,,,51:04.0,51:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13553,5,2,T2 ,I have another basic understanding of what I'm supposed to do here,,51:04.0,51:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13554,5,2,T2 ,so I'm just going to talk while I work,,51:07.0,51:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13555,5,2,T2 ,all right so this goes off like,,51:10.0,51:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13556,5,2,T2 ,these easy problems are giving us more opportunities to talk,,51:13.0,51:16.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
13557,5,2,T2 ,thanks CMU,,51:16.0,51:16.0,00:00.0,,SV,,,,
13558,5,2,T2 ,you know all right,,51:16.0,51:17.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
13559,5,2,T2 ,,yeah,51:17.0,51:18.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
13560,5,2,T2 ,all right yeah,,51:18.0,51:19.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
13561,5,2,T2 ,,you make confusing equipment but easy math problems,51:19.0,51:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13562,5,2,T2 ,yeah like you have like robots in the room next to me,,51:21.0,51:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13563,5,2,T2 ,but in the next room you're teaching a kid how to do math,,51:27.0,51:30.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
13564,5,2,T2 ,,yeah,51:31.0,51:31.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
13565,5,2,T2 ,oh this is wrong,,51:31.0,51:36.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13566,5,2,T2 ,,yeah I was starting to wonder what was going on there,51:38.0,51:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13567,5,2,T2 ,yeah (inaudible) pause filler,,51:40.0,51:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13568,5,2,T2 ,,,51:40.0,51:47.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13569,5,2,T2 ,,so the next five up there right,51:40.0,51:47.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13570,5,2,T2 ,pause filler yeah,,51:48.0,51:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13571,5,2,T2 ,,so here's one thing I notice you're getting confused at,51:49.0,51:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13572,5,2,T2 ,,,51:49.0,51:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13573,5,2,T2 ,,,51:52.0,51:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13574,5,2,T2 ,,what you want to do is that,51:52.0,51:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13575,5,2,T2 ,,,51:54.0,51:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13576,5,2,T2 ,,you're doing the five,51:54.0,51:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13577,5,2,T2 ,,,51:58.0,52:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13578,5,2,T2 ,,you want to do this but,51:58.0,52:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13579,5,2,T2 ,,,52:00.0,52:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13580,5,2,T2 ,,and it's hard because for you,52:00.0,52:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13581,5,2,T2 ,,,52:04.0,52:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13582,5,2,T2 ,,you're not finding any numbers,52:04.0,52:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13583,5,2,T2 ,,but if you were actually to do this that,52:06.0,52:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13584,5,2,T2 ,,,52:06.0,52:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13585,5,2,T2 ,,so it must be x isn't it,52:08.0,52:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13586,5,2,T2 ,,I don't know why I put it,52:10.0,52:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13587,5,2,T2 ,that's anx,,52:11.0,52:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13588,5,2,T2 ,,,52:13.0,52:19.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13589,5,2,T2 ,,yeah so if you were to actually put the problem like this,52:13.0,52:19.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
13590,5,2,T2 ,,you would still put a five over what five over x,52:19.0,52:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13591,5,2,T2 ,,,52:19.0,52:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13592,5,2,T2 ,,then the x would care about,52:23.0,52:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13593,5,2,T2 ,,,52:23.0,52:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13594,5,2,T2 ,,,52:24.0,52:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13595,5,2,T2 ,,so it would just be one hundred thirty-seven x equals five,52:24.0,52:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13596,5,2,T2 ,,,52:28.0,52:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13597,5,2,T2 ,,and then it be a lot simpler for you to simplify it,52:28.0,52:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
13598,5,2,T2 ,,so with that I think if you were to start pause filler the space the problems like that,52:32.0,52:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13599,5,2,T2 ,,,52:32.0,52:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13600,5,2,T2 ,,you'll be able to get passed them pretty fast,52:37.0,52:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13601,5,2,T2 ,,,52:37.0,52:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13602,5,2,T2 ,all right so pause filler it just be times x right,,52:39.0,52:49.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
13603,5,2,T2 ,,,52:50.0,52:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13604,5,2,T2 ,,yeah so one over x,52:50.0,52:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13605,5,2,T2 ,,,52:52.0,52:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13606,5,2,T2 ,,or x times x,52:52.0,52:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13607,5,2,T2 ,,it doesn't matter whichever way of those you put it,52:54.0,52:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13608,5,2,T2 ,right,,53:00.0,53:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13609,5,2,T2 ,,,53:01.0,53:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13610,5,2,T2 ,,yeah so that's also correct,53:01.0,53:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13611,5,2,T2 ,,and your outcome is for this part here,53:04.0,53:11.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13612,5,2,T2 ,,so it's one thirty-seven x equals five yeah,53:12.0,53:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13613,5,2,T2 ,,,53:12.0,53:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13614,5,2,T2 ,all right pause filler,,53:17.0,53:24.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
13615,5,2,T2 ,one hundred and thirty-seven pause filler equals oh god my brain is like melting now,,53:25.0,53:37.0,00:12.0,,SV,,,,
13616,5,2,T2 ,,yeah okay I can just see how tired you are,53:38.0,53:41.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
13617,5,2,T2 ,oh,,53:42.0,53:42.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13618,5,2,T2 ,all right and then five,,53:42.0,53:56.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
13619,5,2,T2 ,yeah yeah (laughter),,53:56.0,54:01.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
13620,5,2,T2 ,,,54:01.0,54:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13621,5,2,T2 ,,also you might forgot a little something there,54:01.0,54:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13622,5,2,T2 ,what,,54:04.0,54:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13623,5,2,T2 ,oh yeah there's an x there,,54:05.0,54:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
13624,5,2,T2 ,yeah yeah yeah,,54:07.0,54:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13625,5,2,T2 ,,yeah,54:09.0,54:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
13626,5,2,T2 ,,so yeah,54:09.0,54:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
13627,5,2,T2 ,,then once you get all this you just got to simplify it,54:10.0,54:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13628,5,2,T2 ,,,54:10.0,54:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
13629,5,2,T2 ,,and then the whole thing becomes very very easy,54:13.0,54:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

14015,6,1,T1 ,,and then like that��_s the rest of the hall,18:18.0,18:24.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14016,6,1,T1 ,okay moving on,,18:25.0,18:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14017,6,1,T1 ,,okay he told us we unlocked the bonus round or something,18:27.0,18:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14018,6,1,T1 ,we're special,,18:31.0,18:32.0,00:01.0,,,LPA,,,
14019,6,1,T1 ,,,18:33.0,19:40.0,01:07.0,,,,,,
14020,6,1,T1 ,,okay so would you subtract the u or four u,18:34.0,18:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14021,6,1,T1 ,,or do you subtract,18:37.0,18:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14022,6,1,T1 ,,or do you add forty-two or subtract eight,18:38.0,18:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14023,6,1,T1 ,I'm subtracting the eight,,18:40.0,18:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14024,6,1,T1 ,,good yeah sometimes I'm like no,18:42.0,18:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14025,6,1,T1 ,,I don��_t want to subtract the eight,18:46.0,18:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14026,6,1,T1 ,,but today I am let's see,18:48.0,18:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14027,6,1,T1 ,,so let's see,18:51.0,18:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14028,6,1,T1 ,,negative of fifty plus u equals four u minus u minus u negative fifty,18:52.0,19:04.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
14029,6,1,T1 ,,wait I'll make sure you got it first three why are you,19:05.0,19:11.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14030,6,1,T1 ,,why do you hate me just computers such a mean human,19:12.0,19:19.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14031,6,1,T1 ,wait no undo go back,,19:19.0,19:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14032,6,1,T1 ,,seventeen this will be negative sixteen and then one thirty wait hold,19:24.0,19:30.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14033,6,1,T1 ,will be two thirds because sixteen times three is forty-eight yeah okay,,19:32.0,19:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14034,6,1,T1 ,,yup yup there that is the answer,19:36.0,19:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14035,6,1,T1 ,,,19:41.0,20:43.0,01:02.0,,,,,,
14036,6,1,T1 ,yeah okay pause filler okay so this is forty-nine and,,19:41.0,19:54.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
14037,6,1,T1 ,,wait you do that forty-nine and from,19:56.0,19:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14038,6,1,T1 ,oh wow I (laughter) that was wrong,,19:59.0,20:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14039,6,1,T1 ,,yeah so I would do n minus ninety-nine,20:04.0,20:13.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14040,6,1,T1 ,equals,,20:13.0,20:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14041,6,1,T1 ,,wait hold on equals one hundred n minus n,20:14.0,20:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14042,6,1,T1 ,okay and then seven wait yeah,,20:20.0,20:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14043,6,1,T1 ,,so then you get negative ninety-nine equals ninety-nine and (inaudible) nine over ninety-nine wow,20:25.0,20:33.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
14044,6,1,T1 ,,so many big numbers and yet you just get negative one what a waste of math,20:33.0,20:42.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14045,6,1,T1 ,,,20:43.0,21:27.0,00:44.0,,,,,,
14046,6,1,T1 ,,pause filler so how would you start this,20:43.0,20:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14047,6,1,T1 ,pause filler I subtracted the seven because why not,,20:45.0,20:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14048,6,1,T1 ,,forty,20:50.0,20:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14049,6,1,T1 ,you subtract the g,,20:51.0,20:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14050,6,1,T1 ,and then you have g equals four boom,,20:55.0,21:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14051,6,1,T1 ,,wait hold on I want to make sure that��_s right yup wait isn't eighteen minus seven wait oh never mind,21:02.0,21:18.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
14052,6,1,T1 ,,you did differently than me,21:18.0,21:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14053,6,1,T1 ,,you know what I screwed up I can't math,21:19.0,21:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14054,6,1,T1 ,,I'm terrible at math like wow,21:23.0,21:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14055,6,1,T1 ,,,21:27.0,22:11.0,00:44.0,,,,,,
14056,6,1,T1 ,pause filler okay so this is,,21:28.0,21:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14057,6,1,T1 ,you subtract the ten m,,21:29.0,21:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14058,6,1,T1 ,and so you have wait what negative nine equals,,21:32.0,21:41.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14059,6,1,T1 ,,and then you can add the nine right,21:42.0,21:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14060,6,1,T1 ,well you have the twenty-seven to the other side right,,21:46.0,21:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14061,6,1,T1 ,,oh yup you're right,21:49.0,21:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14062,6,1,T1 ,what's negative nine plus twenty-seven,,21:52.0,21:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14063,6,1,T1 ,,eighteen,21:55.0,21:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14064,6,1,T1 ,oh thanks,,21:57.0,21:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14065,6,1,T1 ,,and then divide out by negative nine,21:59.0,22:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14066,6,1,T1 ,,so then what did you get m equals what,22:03.0,22:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14067,6,1,T1 ,negative two,,22:06.0,22:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14068,6,1,T1 ,,that��_s what I go,22:08.0,22:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14069,6,1,T1 ,,so it's probably right,22:09.0,22:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14070,6,1,T1 ,,,22:12.0,27:30.0,05:18.0,,,,,,
14071,6,1,T1 ,,okay go to the next one I guess,22:12.0,22:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14072,6,1,T1 ,yup pause filler minus subtract the pause filler eight y,,22:17.0,22:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14073,6,1,T1 ,so you have negative seven y equals,,22:23.0,22:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14074,6,1,T1 ,add the eleven,,22:26.0,22:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14075,6,1,T1 ,,thirty-five,22:28.0,22:28.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14076,6,1,T1 ,thirty-five,,22:28.0,22:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14077,6,1,T1 ,,and then you get y equals negative five oh what was really really not that hard okay,22:29.0,22:39.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
14078,6,1,T1 ,,so I would personally subtract the nineteen,22:40.0,22:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14079,6,1,T1 ,oh wait,,22:43.0,22:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14080,6,1,T1 ,,because I don��_t,22:43.0,22:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14081,6,1,T1 ,fifty-three minus twenty-eight is five,,22:46.0,22:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14082,6,1,T1 ,,oh it's going to be a fraction again,22:51.0,23:04.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
14083,6,1,T1 ,,this one you get pause filler negative ten,23:04.0,23:11.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14084,6,1,T1 ,,do that negative ten point two,23:14.0,23:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14085,6,1,T1 ,one second pause filler,,23:20.0,23:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14086,6,1,T1 ,,it's a fraction,23:24.0,23:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14087,6,1,T1 ,,but I made it that small,23:25.0,23:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14088,6,1,T1 ,,because I feel like being fancy,23:27.0,23:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14089,6,1,T1 ,,because one fifth is zero point two,23:31.0,23:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14090,6,1,T1 ,,I think I'm finally figuring out how to write with this thing,23:34.0,23:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14091,6,1,T1 ,yes same okay I got negative two,,23:38.0,23:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14092,6,1,T1 ,add one twenty fifths,,23:42.0,23:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14093,6,1,T1 ,,what wait how did you get that,23:45.0,23:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14094,6,1,T1 ,pause filler wait thirty,,23:47.0,23:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14095,6,1,T1 ,,twenty you forgot the other side existed thing wait,23:51.0,23:58.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14096,6,1,T1 ,,show all the work for it,23:58.0,23:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14097,6,1,T1 ,,hold on clear it,23:59.0,24:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14098,6,1,T1 ,it's all up here in green up here,,24:01.0,24:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14099,6,1,T1 ,,hold on but can you like show each step out,24:03.0,24:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14100,6,1,T1 ,,so I can see what you did,24:07.0,24:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14101,6,1,T1 ,,because you should get that from what I understand,24:09.0,24:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14102,6,1,T1 ,,can you clear it,24:11.0,24:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14103,6,1,T1 ,,how do I why can't I not clear it,24:13.0,24:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14104,6,1,T1 ,,oh clear,24:21.0,24:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14105,6,1,T1 ,I'm trying to like erase it all,,24:22.0,24:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14106,6,1,T1 ,,but where's the erasing button,24:27.0,24:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14107,6,1,T1 ,it's on the side it's like,,24:30.0,24:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14108,6,1,T1 ,,oh thank you oh my god thank you I didn't even know it existed,24:32.0,24:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14109,6,1,T1 ,,I'm erasing at all,24:37.0,24:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14110,6,1,T1 ,,okay got it I wish you can make the eraser a little,24:40.0,24:49.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14111,6,1,T1 ,yeah,,24:49.0,24:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14112,6,1,T1 ,,if you like I'm scratching the touchscreen every time I write on it,24:49.0,24:56.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14113,6,1,T1 ,okay starting over,,24:56.0,24:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14114,6,1,T1 ,,okay,25:00.0,25:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14115,6,1,T1 ,so I started by subtracting the twenty-eight d from the fifty-three,,25:03.0,25:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14116,6,1,T1 ,so fifty-three minus twenty-eight equals twenty-five right,,25:07.0,25:22.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
14117,6,1,T1 ,and then you have twenty-five d,,25:22.0,25:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14118,6,1,T1 ,,right,25:27.0,25:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14119,6,1,T1 ,and then you do,,25:27.0,25:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14120,6,1,T1 ,you subtract the seventy from that side,,25:29.0,25:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14121,6,1,T1 ,and then you do seventy minus nineteen equals pause filler fifty-one,,25:31.0,25:43.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
14122,6,1,T1 ,so that��_s negative fifty-one,,25:43.0,25:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14123,6,1,T1 ,,the time on my computer is really off,25:47.0,25:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14124,6,1,T1 ,what does it say,,25:50.0,25:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14125,6,1,T1 ,,six zero five and then it's five thirty-two,25:52.0,25:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14126,6,1,T1 ,that��_s a (inaudible),,25:54.0,25:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14127,6,1,T1 ,and then d equals negative fifty-one twenty-five,,25:55.0,26:05.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
14128,6,1,T1 ,or that equals negative two one,,26:07.0,26:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14129,6,1,T1 ,that��_s what I got,,26:13.0,26:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14130,6,1,T1 ,I mean I think it's right,,26:14.0,26:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14131,6,1,T1 ,,oh wait yeah well yeah I think you're right,26:17.0,26:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

14252,6,1,T2 ,,,35:53.0,36:05.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
14253,6,1,T2 ,okay so what do you do first,,35:54.0,35:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14254,6,1,T2 ,,let's see let's see,35:57.0,35:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14255,6,1,T2 ,,why are you not letting me write through there,35:59.0,36:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14256,6,1,T2 ,,did I do it right,36:03.0,36:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14257,6,1,T2 ,yup,,36:04.0,36:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14258,6,1,T2 ,,,36:05.0,36:25.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
14259,6,1,T2 ,,okay next problem these aren't the problems you did right just not sure we're not saying or anything,36:06.0,36:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14260,6,1,T2 ,,yeah pause filler,36:11.0,36:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14261,6,1,T2 ,,and then you have to divide out by a negative one,36:14.0,36:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14262,6,1,T2 ,,because there's a negative,36:19.0,36:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14263,6,1,T2 ,,and then you get y,36:20.0,36:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14264,6,1,T2 ,,there's a negative five okay next one,36:23.0,36:31.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
14265,6,1,T2 ,,,36:25.0,37:16.0,00:51.0,,,,,,
14266,6,1,T2 ,,pause filler change the color so we're like not the same color,36:31.0,36:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14267,6,1,T2 ,,but I don��_t like that color,36:37.0,36:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14268,6,1,T2 ,,go with brown,36:40.0,36:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14269,6,1,T2 ,,you know what let's go brown,36:41.0,36:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14270,6,1,T2 ,,okay I know I wasn��_t supposed to change the color,36:44.0,36:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14271,6,1,T2 ,,but you know what I'm a rebel in this study,36:47.0,36:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14272,6,1,T2 ,you're such a rebel,,36:49.0,36:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14273,6,1,T2 ,,such a rebel let's so then you have to add fourteen,36:51.0,36:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14274,6,1,T2 ,,so you get negative k equals fifty plus k wait oh my,36:55.0,37:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14275,6,1,T2 ,,and then you subtract k,37:01.0,37:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14276,6,1,T2 ,,and then you subtract k again,37:03.0,37:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14277,6,1,T2 ,,so negative two k equals fifty,37:04.0,37:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14278,6,1,T2 ,,and then you just divide out by a negative two,37:07.0,37:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14279,6,1,T2 ,two yeah,,37:09.0,37:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14280,6,1,T2 ,,and then k is negative twenty-five whoa like math,37:10.0,37:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14281,6,1,T2 ,,whoo,37:15.0,37:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14282,6,1,T2 ,,I have many problems to do outside,37:16.0,37:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14283,6,1,T2 ,,,37:18.0,37:46.0,00:28.0,,,,,,
14284,6,1,T2 ,,and I'm going to add b,37:19.0,37:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14285,6,1,T2 ,okay,,37:22.0,37:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14286,6,1,T2 ,,so you get seventeen,37:23.0,37:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14287,6,1,T2 ,,seventeen equals thirteen plus two b,37:27.0,37:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14288,6,1,T2 ,,I'm showing on equal sign here equals,37:30.0,37:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14289,6,1,T2 ,,what the what the why why why do you do this to me,37:35.0,37:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14290,6,1,T2 ,,and then four equals two b,37:38.0,37:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14291,6,1,T2 ,,divide by out two,37:41.0,37:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14292,6,1,T2 ,,and divide out by two,37:42.0,37:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14293,6,1,T2 ,,and then two is b,37:44.0,37:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14294,6,1,T2 ,yeah,,37:47.0,37:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14295,6,1,T2 ,,all right,37:47.0,37:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14296,6,1,T2 ,,,37:49.0,38:11.0,00:22.0,,,,,,
14297,6,1,T2 ,wait pause filler never mind yeah go,,37:49.0,37:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14298,6,1,T2 ,,and screen up right okay,37:52.0,37:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14299,6,1,T2 ,,I hope this isn't that hard,37:54.0,37:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14300,6,1,T2 ,,okay so then you just divide out by negative nine,37:58.0,38:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14301,6,1,T2 ,yeah,,38:03.0,38:03.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14302,6,1,T2 ,,so g equals negative nine,38:03.0,38:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14303,6,1,T2 ,,whoo my life is so easy right now,38:08.0,38:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14304,6,1,T2 ,,wait how do I get to the next page,38:12.0,38:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14305,6,1,T2 ,,okay there we go,38:13.0,38:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14306,6,1,T2 ,,,38:13.0,38:56.0,00:43.0,,,,,,
14307,6,1,T2 ,,so I'll subtract ten,38:14.0,38:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14308,6,1,T2 ,ten yeah,,38:16.0,38:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14309,6,1,T2 ,,seventy-two equals negative eight y divided by negative eight,38:22.0,38:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14310,6,1,T2 ,,for some reason I always write those slashes,38:27.0,38:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14311,6,1,T2 ,,I really don��_t know why,38:29.0,38:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14312,6,1,T2 ,,it's like a weird habit so yeah why (inaudible) equal so,38:30.0,38:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14313,6,1,T2 ,,this thing hates me,38:35.0,38:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14314,6,1,T2 ,,all right next y equals,38:37.0,38:42.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14315,6,1,T2 ,,scribble me too mine is sixty-five,38:42.0,38:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14316,6,1,T2 ,,this better come out to be easy in division pause filler let me forty-two hey cool,38:45.0,38:55.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
14317,6,1,T2 ,,negative fourteen x divided that by negative fourteen divided up by negative fourteen,38:56.0,39:02.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14318,6,1,T2 ,,,38:56.0,39:17.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
14319,6,1,T2 ,,and then you get negative three equals y,39:02.0,39:09.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14320,6,1,T2 ,yeah okay here,,39:09.0,39:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14321,6,1,T2 ,,oh this is hard-ish,39:12.0,39:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14322,6,1,T2 ,,what are you doing,39:14.0,39:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14323,6,1,T2 ,,this thing hates me so much,39:15.0,39:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14324,6,1,T2 ,,you just so work so much (inaudible),39:17.0,39:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14325,6,1,T2 ,,,39:19.0,39:35.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
14326,6,1,T2 ,,seventy-five equals negative nine k,39:19.0,39:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14327,6,1,T2 ,,divide that by negative nine,39:24.0,39:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14328,6,1,T2 ,,divide that by negative nine,39:25.0,39:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14329,6,1,T2 ,,so then you get four and one third equals k or four point three repeating,39:28.0,39:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14330,6,1,T2 ,,,39:35.0,40:53.0,01:18.0,,,,,,
14331,6,1,T2 ,yeah okay pause filler what do you do first,,39:35.0,39:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14332,6,1,T2 ,,I'm just going to add p to get rid of that one,39:39.0,39:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14333,6,1,T2 ,,because it's annoying me,39:43.0,39:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14334,6,1,T2 ,,so you negative fifty-two equals nine p minus sixteen,39:45.0,39:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14335,6,1,T2 ,,then you have to add,39:50.0,39:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14336,6,1,T2 ,,my god what is it doing,39:52.0,39:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14337,6,1,T2 ,,plus sixteen plus sixteen so that would be forty-eight,39:53.0,40:03.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
14338,6,1,T2 ,,negative forty-eight no negative thirty-eight nope that��_s wrong,40:03.0,40:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14339,6,1,T2 ,,hold on thirty-eight,40:08.0,40:13.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14340,6,1,T2 ,,so I can't do math,40:13.0,40:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14341,6,1,T2 ,,thirty-eight equals nine p divided by nine divided by,40:14.0,40:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14342,6,1,T2 ,wait wouldn't it be negative forty-six,,40:18.0,40:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14343,6,1,T2 ,look what I wrote here,,40:21.0,40:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14344,6,1,T2 ,,no it's negative fifty-two plus,40:23.0,40:29.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14345,6,1,T2 ,,so negative would be four,40:32.0,40:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14346,6,1,T2 ,oh no it's thirty-six,,40:34.0,40:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14347,6,1,T2 ,it's thirty-six,,40:35.0,40:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14348,6,1,T2 ,,thirty-six so when you get four equals p,40:36.0,40:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14349,6,1,T2 ,,yeah math so this is so challenging plus one forty-one,40:42.0,40:53.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
14350,6,1,T2 ,,so you get negative fourteen w equals one hundred and sixty plus twenty-six w minus twenty-six w minus twenty-six w which is forty,40:53.0,41:08.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
14351,6,1,T2 ,,,40:53.0,41:24.0,00:31.0,,,,,,
14352,6,1,T2 ,,w equals one hundred and sixty divided by negative forty divided by negative forty,41:08.0,41:17.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14353,6,1,T2 ,,which would be w equals negative four,41:18.0,41:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14354,6,1,T2 ,,so math (inaudible) math stop come and get us,41:24.0,41:33.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14355,6,1,T2 ,do we have to,,41:34.0,41:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14356,6,1,T2 ,,I don't know,41:36.0,41:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14357,6,1,T2 ,no,,41:37.0,41:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14358,6,1,T2 ,,refusing,41:37.0,41:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14359,6,1,T2 ,okay well what had happened last time,,41:38.0,41:49.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
14360,6,1,T2 ,they just didn't do anything,,41:50.0,41:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14361,6,1,T2 ,so I guess we can go on,,41:51.0,41:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14362,6,1,T2 ,,wait should we wait though,41:52.0,41:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14363,6,1,T2 ,,because last time they told us to wait,41:54.0,41:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14364,6,1,T2 ,,I guess we're like special,41:56.0,42:02.0,00:06.0,,,,0,,
14365,6,1,T2 ,,and we apparently do these really quickly,42:03.0,42:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14366,6,1,T2 ,yeah I guess,,42:06.0,42:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14367,6,1,T2 ,,well I guess if you're doing this at the beginning it will be harder,42:06.0,42:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14368,6,1,T2 ,yeah should we pause filler,,42:11.0,42:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14369,6,1,T2 ,,where are they,42:12.0,42:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14370,6,1,T2 ,,we don��_t know where they are,42:16.0,42:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14371,6,1,T2 ,,we don��_t know where they are (laughter) where are,42:20.0,42:28.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
14372,6,1,T2 ,okay pause filler why don��_t we just see if they're,,42:29.0,42:38.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14373,6,1,T2 ,,I'll look up into the (inaudible) (sfx),42:41.0,42:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14374,6,1,T2 ,I don��_t like see anyone so,,42:43.0,43:08.0,00:25.0,,,,,,
14375,6,1,T2 ,,I'm going to check outside my door to see anyone there,43:08.0,44:10.0,01:02.0,,,,,,
14376,6,1,T2 ,,okay oh,44:19.0,44:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14377,6,1,T2 ,,okay so add y to both sides like you're saying,44:27.0,44:33.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14378,6,1,T2 ,,,44:33.0,44:45.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
14379,6,1,T2 ,,,44:33.0,45:10.0,00:37.0,,,,,,
14380,6,1,T2 ,yeah,,44:33.0,44:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14381,6,1,T2 ,,so if you subtracted y then there would be zero ys,44:35.0,44:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14382,6,1,T2 ,,and that would be kind of problematic,44:38.0,44:49.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
14383,6,1,T2 ,oh oh sorry,,44:49.0,44:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14384,6,1,T2 ,,so when you get negative one hundred and six equals two y divided by two divided by two negative fifty-three okay is that right probably,44:51.0,45:05.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
14385,6,1,T2 ,,,44:54.0,56:11.0,11:17.0,,,,,,
14386,6,1,T2 ,yeah,,45:05.0,45:05.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14387,6,1,T2 ,,I was writing that upside down that whole time,45:05.0,45:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14388,6,1,T2 ,,it's so much easier if I got wow,45:08.0,45:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14389,6,1,T2 ,,,45:10.0,45:55.0,00:45.0,,,,,,
14390,6,1,T2 ,,pause filler equals four divided by forty-eight plus two p,45:21.0,45:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14391,6,1,T2 ,,okay it's minus fifteen,45:30.0,45:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14392,6,1,T2 ,,negative two hundred and thirty equals two p divided by two divided by two negative one hundred fifteen equals p,45:35.0,45:53.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
14393,6,1,T2 ,,but why did that (inaudible) thirteen,45:53.0,45:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14394,6,1,T2 ,,,45:56.0,46:40.0,00:44.0,,,,,,
14395,6,1,T2 ,,this was one k plus g,45:56.0,46:03.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14396,6,1,T2 ,,oh this one is going to be semi easier right,46:04.0,46:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14397,6,1,T2 ,yeah so it's two g and then,,46:07.0,46:15.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
14398,6,1,T2 ,,minus fifty-three minus fifty-three this will be,46:17.0,46:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14399,6,1,T2 ,,hold on one seventy no seventy-six,46:20.0,46:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14400,6,1,T2 ,,I can't talk okay,46:26.0,46:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14401,6,1,T2 ,,seventy-six equals two g divided by two divided by two thirty-eight equals three,46:27.0,46:37.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
14402,6,1,T2 ,,,46:41.0,47:40.0,00:59.0,,,,,,
14403,6,1,T2 ,yeah okay,,46:42.0,46:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14404,6,1,T2 ,,thank you pause filler and plus m,46:44.0,46:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14405,6,1,T2 ,,these are all like the same type of problem,46:50.0,46:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14406,6,1,T2 ,yeah,,46:54.0,46:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14407,6,1,T2 ,,I wish my math homework was all the same type of problem specifically like eight thousand different types of math problems a day,46:54.0,47:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14408,6,1,T2 ,,it's thirty,47:02.0,47:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14409,6,1,T2 ,,are you back at school yet,47:03.0,47:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

14414,6,1,T2 ,,but the reason we had such a long break is there's this big debate thing at my school that��_s been going on a week,47:15.0,47:21.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14415,6,1,T2 ,,so it was like you know,47:21.0,47:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14416,6,1,T2 ,okay,,47:24.0,47:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14417,6,1,T2 ,,so it's like,47:25.0,47:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14418,6,1,T2 ,,I think we're supposed to go back last week or something,47:26.0,47:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14419,6,1,T2 ,,but we're not going back until Wednesday,47:28.0,47:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14420,6,1,T2 ,,because my break started on the eighteenth,47:31.0,47:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14421,6,1,T2 ,,so we had a really long break this year,47:33.0,47:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14422,6,1,T2 ,,it's never this long,47:35.0,47:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14423,6,1,T2 ,,I'm guessing that��_s all right,47:37.0,47:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14424,6,1,T2 ,,I'm just going to guess,47:38.0,47:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14425,6,1,T2 ,,that��_s all right,47:39.0,47:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

14427,6,1,T2 ,,,47:44.0,48:26.0,00:42.0,,,,,,
14428,6,1,T2 ,,the real question here should I add sixty-five or twenty-five,47:44.0,47:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14429,6,1,T2 ,,I'll add sixty-five you know,47:47.0,47:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14430,6,1,T2 ,it took fraction I think,,47:49.0,48:13.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
14431,6,1,T2 ,yeah that is,,48:13.0,48:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14432,6,1,T2 ,,twenty ninths four two point two repeating,48:15.0,48:23.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
14433,6,1,T2 ,two,,48:24.0,48:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14434,6,1,T2 ,,,48:26.0,50:08.0,01:42.0,,,,,,
14435,6,1,T2 ,,two point two repeating okay let's try this one,48:26.0,48:52.0,00:26.0,,,,,,
14436,6,1,T2 ,wow oh okay (laughter),,48:52.0,48:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

14438,6,1,T2 ,on the side or something there's like,,48:57.0,48:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14439,6,1,T2 ,,whoa coloring in the circle,49:00.0,49:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14440,6,1,T2 ,okay anyways pause filler,,49:05.0,49:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14441,6,1,T2 ,,and this is why you don��_t let me have technology,49:08.0,49:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14442,6,1,T2 ,,okay thirty-three and then you get negative two hundred equals one hundred x,49:15.0,49:24.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14443,6,1,T2 ,,and then negative two equals x,49:24.0,49:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14444,6,1,T2 ,,long story short there you go,49:26.0,49:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

14450,6,1,T2 ,,there's plenty of other totally (inaudible),49:43.0,49:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14451,6,1,T2 ,,but Harry Potter happens to not be one of them,49:45.0,49:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14452,6,1,T2 ,,forty-two forty-one yup forty-one y plus thirty-seven minus thirty-seven y you add the thirty-seven just to subtract it,49:55.0,50:07.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
14453,6,1,T2 ,,okay pause filler,50:07.0,50:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14454,6,1,T2 ,,,50:08.0,50:35.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
14455,6,1,T2 ,,so that would be twelve equals forty-one y,50:08.0,50:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14456,6,1,T2 ,,and then you just get twelve forty-first equals one op,50:15.0,50:22.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14457,6,1,T2 ,oh this has so many numbers,,50:22.0,50:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14458,6,1,T2 ,,oh math in general (inaudible) there we go,50:27.0,50:35.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
14459,6,1,T2 ,,,50:35.0,51:33.0,00:58.0,,,,,,
14460,6,1,T2 ,,okay I guess I'll start with subtracting sixty-one,50:35.0,50:44.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14461,6,1,T2 ,okay,,50:46.0,50:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14462,6,1,T2 ,,so then you would get two hundred and six minus thirty-three z,50:48.0,50:57.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14463,6,1,T2 ,,ah this (inaudible) you like writing calligraphy,50:58.0,51:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14464,6,1,T2 ,,because you have to (inaudible),51:00.0,51:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14465,6,1,T2 ,,so that would be sixty-seven two hundred and sixty-seven equals one,51:04.0,51:14.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
14466,6,1,T2 ,,oh my god one hundred and thirty-four z divide out,51:14.0,51:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14467,6,1,T2 ,,divide out long story shorter,51:20.0,51:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14468,6,1,T2 ,,it ends up being like two or something right I don��_t,51:21.0,51:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14469,6,1,T2 ,,yeah or no it would be like one and one hundred something,51:28.0,51:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14470,6,1,T2 ,,,51:33.0,52:58.0,01:25.0,,,,,,
14471,6,1,T2 ,,okay no that��_s a lot of numbers,51:34.0,51:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14472,6,1,T2 ,,pause filler I don't know what I'm doing,51:39.0,51:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14473,6,1,T2 ,well you could start by subtracting the fifty or adding these,,51:43.0,51:53.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
14474,6,1,T2 ,,or I'll subtract,51:54.0,51:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14475,6,1,T2 ,,yeah that��_s a good idea thank you,51:55.0,51:56.0,00:01.0,,,,LP,,
14476,6,1,T2 ,,negative sixty p minus one hundred and forty equals negative fifteen p plus fifty,51:56.0,52:05.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
14477,6,1,T2 ,,so then you can add forty to both side one forty thank you one forty to both sides,52:05.0,52:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14478,6,1,T2 ,,so then you get negative sixty p equals negative fifteen p plus ninety no one hundred and ninety,52:10.0,52:21.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
14479,6,1,T2 ,,and then add fifteen p,52:21.0,52:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14480,6,1,T2 ,,so then you get seventy negative no wait,52:27.0,52:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14481,6,1,T2 ,,wait just fix up,52:33.0,52:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14482,6,1,T2 ,,you get negative forty-five p equals one hundred and ninety,52:33.0,52:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14483,6,1,T2 ,,and then divided out by forty-five divided by forty-five,52:39.0,52:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14484,6,1,T2 ,,I want to say forty-five times like four,52:46.0,52:52.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14485,6,1,T2 ,,no not four it would be two,52:52.0,52:57.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14486,6,1,T2 ,,,52:58.0,53:18.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
14487,6,1,T2 ,wait so you have negative forty-five r equals a hundred ninety and then,,52:59.0,53:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14488,6,1,T2 ,,so actually you get four and two ninths negative four and two ninths equals r (sfx),53:02.0,53:12.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
14489,6,1,T2 ,,,53:19.0,55:29.0,02:10.0,,,,,,
14490,6,1,T2 ,okay I guess we should go to the next,,53:19.0,53:31.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
14491,6,1,T2 ,,yeah we only have one more,53:32.0,53:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14492,6,1,T2 ,,did you like,53:36.0,53:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14493,6,1,T2 ,,whoo,53:36.0,53:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14494,6,1,T2 ,,you have twenty-three problems,53:38.0,53:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14495,6,1,T2 ,,I feel like there was an extra one,53:40.0,53:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14496,6,1,T2 ,yeah I think I did,,53:42.0,53:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14497,6,1,T2 ,,I'm sorry that sucks,53:44.0,53:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14498,6,1,T2 ,we only got to like twenty-one or so,,53:47.0,53:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14499,6,1,T2 ,,either I'm really fast at math or I'm doing it wrong,53:52.0,53:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14500,6,1,T2 ,no you're going pretty fast,,53:54.0,53:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14501,6,1,T2 ,,I guess just,53:57.0,53:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14502,6,1,T2 ,,because I did this already,53:58.0,53:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14503,6,1,T2 ,,oh it's so hard to read your own handwriting on this thing,54:09.0,54:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14504,6,1,T2 ,yeah,,54:11.0,54:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14505,6,1,T2 ,,it keeps like going a little crazy on me oh my god,54:11.0,54:16.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14506,6,1,T2 ,,well let's see here (inaudible) fifty y,54:18.0,54:25.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14507,6,1,T2 ,,so you have one hundred and thirty,54:25.0,54:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14508,6,1,T2 ,,no one hundred and fifty-five equals or no,54:27.0,54:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14509,6,1,T2 ,,well I had it to five,54:32.0,54:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14510,6,1,T2 ,,so it would be one hundred and sixty equals fifty y,54:33.0,54:40.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14511,6,1,T2 ,,and then divide out by fifty,54:40.0,54:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14512,6,1,T2 ,,divide out by fifty,54:42.0,54:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14513,6,1,T2 ,,and then you get three and one well,54:43.0,54:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14514,6,1,T2 ,three,,54:47.0,54:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14515,6,1,T2 ,,actually we'll do three point two equals y,54:47.0,54:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14516,6,1,T2 ,wait was it one hundred and fifty,,54:51.0,54:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14517,6,1,T2 ,was it a hundred and fifty or a hundred sixty,,54:53.0,54:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

14521,6,1,T2 ,and it was divided by five,,54:59.0,55:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14522,6,1,T2 ,no it was divided by fifty,,55:02.0,55:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14523,6,1,T2 ,oh okay yeah it's (inaudible) after that somewhere,,55:04.0,55:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

14526,6,1,T2 ,,so that would make y three point two there,55:21.0,55:29.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
14527,6,1,T2 ,whoo we're finished,,55:29.0,55:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

14927,6,2,T2 ,,,36:52.0,37:13.0,00:21.0,,,,,,

14941,6,2,T2 ,sixty-two times k times k,,37:31.0,37:36.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14942,6,2,T2 ,four equals sixty-two k divide that by sixty two divided by sixty,,37:36.0,37:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14943,6,2,T2 ,two over thirty-one,,37:43.0,37:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14944,6,2,T2 ,,wait wouldn't it just oh yeah yeah yeah yeah,37:45.0,37:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,

14947,6,2,T2 ,,continue,37:52.0,37:52.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14948,6,2,T2 ,oh wait I don't know I'm going to do that,,37:52.0,37:55.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
14949,6,2,T2 ,,,37:56.0,38:19.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
14950,6,2,T2 ,two hundred and ten y,,37:56.0,37:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14951,6,2,T2 ,I still can't write with the mouse,,37:59.0,38:01.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
14952,6,2,T2 ,equals negative fourteen,,38:01.0,38:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14953,6,2,T2 ,so that would be like seven one zero five,,38:04.0,38:11.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14954,6,2,T2 ,,pause filler yeah,38:13.0,38:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14955,6,2,T2 ,that's probably right,,38:14.0,38:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14956,6,2,T2 ,who cares,,38:18.0,38:19.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
14957,6,2,T2 ,,,38:20.0,39:35.0,01:15.0,,,,,,
14958,6,2,T2 ,,pause filler okay what do you do first,38:20.0,38:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14959,6,2,T2 ,well let's see here,,38:22.0,38:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14960,6,2,T2 ,okay so I would add thirty-nine because I don't know it makes sense,,38:26.0,38:31.0,00:05.0,,,,,,SD
14961,6,2,T2 ,,yeah,38:38.0,38:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
14962,6,2,T2 ,seventeen over x equals twelve over x,,38:38.0,38:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14963,6,2,T2 ,and then it be plus,,38:45.0,38:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14964,6,2,T2 ,,eighteen I'm pretty sure,38:48.0,38:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14965,6,2,T2 ,yeah eighteen,,38:50.0,38:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14966,6,2,T2 ,you're right,,38:51.0,38:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14967,6,2,T2 ,you're right,,38:52.0,38:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14968,6,2,T2 ,and then you multiply by x multiply by x,,38:53.0,38:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14969,6,2,T2 ,and x times x is x squared equals twelve over x squared plus eighteen,,38:56.0,39:04.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
14970,6,2,T2 ,and then you got to multiply by x squared again to cancel out,,39:04.0,39:08.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14971,6,2,T2 ,okay I did this in my homework the other day,,39:08.0,39:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14972,6,2,T2 ,x squared equals twelve plus eighteen,,39:11.0,39:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14973,6,2,T2 ,yup that's about the start you forget on this one right,,39:16.0,39:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14974,6,2,T2 ,,yeah yeah yeah yeah,39:19.0,39:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14975,6,2,T2 ,,I mean I'm not really sure,39:23.0,39:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14976,6,2,T2 ,I'm bad at math,,39:26.0,39:27.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
14977,6,2,T2 ,,most kids maybe,39:27.0,39:28.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
14978,6,2,T2 ,I'm drawing a bow,,39:30.0,39:31.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
14979,6,2,T2 ,you know what I'm drawing bow,,39:31.0,39:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
14980,6,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm,39:33.0,39:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14981,6,2,T2 ,okay plus ninety-two because we got to get rid of that negative right,,39:35.0,39:42.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
14982,6,2,T2 ,,,39:35.0,40:38.0,01:03.0,,,,,,
14983,6,2,T2 ,so then you get one zero three,,39:42.0,39:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14984,6,2,T2 ,one zero three plus twelve x,,39:46.0,39:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14985,6,2,T2 ,(inaudible) negative nine x equals one of three,,39:51.0,39:57.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14986,6,2,T2 ,and negative (inaudible),,39:57.0,40:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14987,6,2,T2 ,I don't know it's like eleven and four ninths,,40:00.0,40:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
14988,6,2,T2 ,,oh I'm seeing just like a bunch of random ys,40:07.0,40:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14989,6,2,T2 ,,so I can't really (laugther),40:08.0,40:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14990,6,2,T2 ,yeah I know it's not writing,,40:09.0,40:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
14991,6,2,T2 ,,aside from what it says,40:11.0,40:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
14992,6,2,T2 ,it's not writing,,40:15.0,40:16.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
14993,6,2,T2 ,I don't know why I'm so annoyed,,40:16.0,40:18.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
14994,6,2,T2 ,awesome track,,40:19.0,40:20.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
14995,6,2,T2 ,what is it pause filler,,40:22.0,40:30.0,00:08.0,,SV,,,,
14996,6,2,T2 ,oh I'm going to play everything,,40:30.0,40:36.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
14997,6,2,T2 ,don't write yet,,40:36.0,40:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14998,6,2,T2 ,,okay,40:37.0,40:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
14999,6,2,T2 ,,,40:38.0,41:24.0,00:46.0,,,,,,
15000,6,2,T2 ,so you would subtract twenty-five,,40:39.0,40:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15001,6,2,T2 ,subtract twenty-five,,40:44.0,40:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15002,6,2,T2 ,so you got one over x plus forty-five equals that,,40:47.0,40:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15003,6,2,T2 ,,no it should be thirty-five,40:53.0,40:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15004,6,2,T2 ,oh yup you're right,,40:55.0,40:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15005,6,2,T2 ,you're right,,40:56.0,40:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15006,6,2,T2 ,you're right,,40:57.0,40:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15007,6,2,T2 ,thank you tutor for math,,40:57.0,41:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15008,6,2,T2 ,so I guess you could just really subtract one over x minus one over thirty-five equals eight over x,,41:01.0,41:08.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
15009,6,2,T2 ,then you get thirty-five x equals eight,,41:08.0,41:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15010,6,2,T2 ,and then you get,,41:12.0,41:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15011,6,2,T2 ,,x equals eight,41:14.0,41:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15012,6,2,T2 ,eight thirty fifth,,41:17.0,41:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15013,6,2,T2 ,,yeah,41:20.0,41:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15014,6,2,T2 ,that's right because I don't even know,,41:22.0,41:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15015,6,2,T2 ,,,41:25.0,42:31.0,01:06.0,,,,,,
15016,6,2,T2 ,,okay and then what do you do first,41:25.0,41:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15017,6,2,T2 ,you add one ninety-two both sides,,41:28.0,41:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15018,6,2,T2 ,this is the x equals scruples,,41:32.0,41:40.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
15019,6,2,T2 ,,wow,41:41.0,41:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15020,6,2,T2 ,,pause filler that's really nice,41:41.0,41:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15021,6,2,T2 ,I think that should be qualified as a legitimate answer,,41:43.0,41:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15022,6,2,T2 ,all right and this is what happens when I'm tired,,41:48.0,41:56.0,00:08.0,,SV,,,,
15023,6,2,T2 ,,okay you add the one ninety,41:57.0,41:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15024,6,2,T2 ,,and that equals like three hundred forty if you plan on doing that first yeah,41:58.0,42:06.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
15025,6,2,T2 ,and then negative fix x plus six x is x equals one x,,42:07.0,42:13.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15026,6,2,T2 ,(inaudible) I don't even know (inaudible),,42:13.0,42:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15027,6,2,T2 ,so then you get oh wait no you have to subtract this you get negative eleven x to this equals three hundred and forty,,42:14.0,42:22.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
15028,6,2,T2 ,and then you get negative eleven equals three hundred and forty x,,42:22.0,42:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15029,6,2,T2 ,and you get eleven three hundred and forty x,,42:26.0,42:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15030,6,2,T2 ,but it's negative,,42:29.0,42:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15031,6,2,T2 ,there you go,,42:30.0,42:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

15049,6,2,T2 ,,okay like I say give us twenty-five minutes to do pause filler,43:37.0,43:40.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
15050,6,2,T2 ,,so I like five fifty-seven they should come and get us,43:43.0,43:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15051,6,2,T2 ,,so that's how much longer we have,43:47.0,43:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15052,6,2,T2 ,,boom let's go,43:53.0,43:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15053,6,2,T2 ,,math (sfx),43:57.0,43:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

15061,6,2,T2 ,,yeah (laughter),44:18.0,44:19.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
15062,6,2,T2 ,I'm just moving on because the answer is negative eight over three x,,44:19.0,44:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15063,6,2,T2 ,and I can tell you that just from looking at it,,44:24.0,44:26.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
15064,6,2,T2 ,,one,44:27.0,44:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

15066,6,2,T2 ,,,44:31.0,45:09.0,00:38.0,,,,,,
15067,6,2,T2 ,x plus thirty-eight how do you,,44:31.0,44:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15068,6,2,T2 ,so first of all you got to multiply it by x plus thirty,,44:35.0,44:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15069,6,2,T2 ,cancel it out,,44:38.0,44:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15070,6,2,T2 ,,yeah,44:39.0,44:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15071,6,2,T2 ,so that would be negative two equals seventy-three,,44:41.0,44:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15072,6,2,T2 ,you could distribute with that some kind of boring,,44:46.0,44:50.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
15073,6,2,T2 ,negative forty equals seventy-three x I'm going to do it on seventy-three,,44:54.0,45:05.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
15074,6,2,T2 ,and here is your answer,,45:05.0,45:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,

15076,6,2,T2 ,,,45:09.0,46:58.0,01:49.0,,,,,,
15077,6,2,T2 ,,okay so I guess you multiply it by negative x minus one to cancel out yeah,45:12.0,45:29.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
15078,6,2,T2 ,,hmm,45:31.0,45:39.0,00:08.0,,,,,,

15461,7,1,T1 ,,and that's x equals,10:12.0,10:21.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
15462,7,1,T1 ,,and then three plus six nineteen,10:22.0,10:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

15465,7,1,T1 ,yeah I guess so,,10:33.0,10:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15466,7,1,T1 ,,yeah all right how do you go to the next one,10:36.0,10:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

15471,7,1,T1 ,,okay,10:49.0,10:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15472,7,1,T1 ,,,10:52.0,13:19.0,02:27.0,,,,,,
15473,7,1,T1 ,so pause filler I guess I do seven no eleven,,10:52.0,10:59.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
15474,7,1,T1 ,plus seventeen,,11:01.0,11:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15475,7,1,T1 ,man my handwriting is horrible,,11:04.0,11:07.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
15476,7,1,T1 ,okay so,,11:07.0,11:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15477,7,1,T1 ,and I do eleven plus k,,11:10.0,11:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15478,7,1,T1 ,so that cancels out k so,,11:14.0,11:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15479,7,1,T1 ,,like add eleven each side,11:17.0,11:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15480,7,1,T1 ,yeah so then it's pretty much that's twenty-eight,,11:19.0,11:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15481,7,1,T1 ,,yeah and then plus,11:25.0,11:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15482,7,1,T1 ,,wait yeah or subtract,11:28.0,11:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15483,7,1,T1 ,,are you subtracting eleven because that would cancel out eleven then,11:31.0,11:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15484,7,1,T1 ,,if you subtract it eleven because then like then that would be zero,11:37.0,11:42.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15485,7,1,T1 ,,and you can just like go like that,11:42.0,11:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15486,7,1,T1 ,,and then that would be seven wait no that would be six,11:44.0,11:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15487,7,1,T1 ,,(laughter) you got it,11:48.0,11:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15488,7,1,T1 ,yeah,,11:51.0,11:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15489,7,1,T1 ,,I think so yeah,11:51.0,11:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15490,7,1,T1 ,maybe maybe not,,11:53.0,11:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15491,7,1,T1 ,well I have no idea,,11:55.0,11:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15492,7,1,T1 ,,okay let's start like let's start fresh I guess,11:56.0,12:01.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15493,7,1,T1 ,,like here okay,12:02.0,12:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15494,7,1,T1 ,okay so,,12:05.0,12:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15495,7,1,T1 ,,let's subtract the eleven from each side,12:09.0,12:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15496,7,1,T1 ,okay so seventeen minus eleven,,12:13.0,12:19.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15497,7,1,T1 ,and k minus eleven,,12:19.0,12:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15498,7,1,T1 ,if I did equals eleven,,12:23.0,12:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15499,7,1,T1 ,I have no idea,,12:25.0,12:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15500,7,1,T1 ,,I just like scratch out the one,12:27.0,12:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15501,7,1,T1 ,,or did you like or you do eleven minus eleven,12:31.0,12:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15502,7,1,T1 ,,and seventeen minus eleven,12:35.0,12:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15503,7,1,T1 ,,and they like (inaudible) I don't know,12:36.0,12:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15504,7,1,T1 ,yeah pause filler well k isn't going anywhere because it's not a number necessarily so,,12:41.0,12:47.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15505,7,1,T1 ,,so then we can just cancel out the eleven then,12:48.0,12:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15506,7,1,T1 ,,and would just be a k alone,12:49.0,12:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15507,7,1,T1 ,yeah it's hardly like what I'm doing,,12:51.0,12:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15508,7,1,T1 ,,then it could be yeah,12:55.0,12:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15509,7,1,T1 ,okay don't judge I have no idea what that is it looks like a fish,,12:57.0,13:02.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,
15510,7,1,T1 ,okay so then seventeen minus eleven would be six,,13:02.0,13:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15511,7,1,T1 ,,six yeah,13:07.0,13:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15512,7,1,T1 ,,so then six equals k oh,13:10.0,13:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15513,7,1,T1 ,k equals six,,13:14.0,13:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15514,7,1,T1 ,,yeah,13:15.0,13:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15515,7,1,T1 ,we did it,,13:16.0,13:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15516,7,1,T1 ,,circle out I'm trying to circle out,13:17.0,13:19.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
15517,7,1,T1 ,,okay so how do you go to the next one,13:19.0,13:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15518,7,1,T1 ,,,13:19.0,19:05.0,05:46.0,,,,,,

15521,7,1,T1 ,then add okay s I know how to do this one,,13:33.0,13:38.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15522,7,1,T1 ,okay so what you'll have to do is you have to,,13:38.0,13:47.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
15523,7,1,T1 ,yeah add forty-four plus two,,13:47.0,13:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15524,7,1,T1 ,hundred twenty,,13:52.0,13:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15525,7,1,T1 ,,we add it,13:56.0,13:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15526,7,1,T1 ,I think,,13:58.0,13:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15527,7,1,T1 ,,or divide it,13:59.0,14:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15528,7,1,T1 ,,like two hundred twenty divided forty-four,14:00.0,14:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15529,7,1,T1 ,,pause filler,14:01.0,14:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15530,7,1,T1 ,,because then if you did that you'd figure out how many times it goes and there's pretty much a twenty in it so x,14:03.0,14:13.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
15531,7,1,T1 ,ah okay I got it,,14:13.0,14:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15532,7,1,T1 ,you have to divide it,,14:14.0,14:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15533,7,1,T1 ,,oh yeah yeah yeah okay so I'll do,14:15.0,14:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,

15648,7,1,T1 ,okay so first you are going to take the nine,,20:10.0,20:16.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15649,7,1,T1 ,and what you want to do is actually you want to add it to thirteen p,,20:16.0,20:24.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
15650,7,1,T1 ,,you want to add the nine to thirteen p,20:25.0,20:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15651,7,1,T1 ,yeah,,20:27.0,20:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15652,7,1,T1 ,,wait what do you mean,20:29.0,20:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15653,7,1,T1 ,,like so or you want to add like add nine,20:30.0,20:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15654,7,1,T1 ,,like do you want to cancel out the nine and,20:33.0,20:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15655,7,1,T1 ,no what you want to do is you want to add nine plus negative nine which wait no,,20:36.0,20:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15656,7,1,T1 ,,yeah yeah because (inaudible) yeah,20:42.0,20:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15657,7,1,T1 ,,and then you could like cross that,20:43.0,20:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15658,7,1,T1 ,yeah which would equal nine so,,20:45.0,20:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15659,7,1,T1 ,,well wait negative nine plus nine,20:47.0,20:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15660,7,1,T1 ,yeah,,20:49.0,20:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15661,7,1,T1 ,,so it's zero,20:50.0,20:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15662,7,1,T1 ,wait might be,,20:53.0,20:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15663,7,1,T1 ,well anyway you want to make that nine to a positive,,20:53.0,20:59.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15664,7,1,T1 ,so I don't know how to do that,,21:00.0,21:02.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
15665,7,1,T1 ,I forget,,21:02.0,21:02.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
15666,7,1,T1 ,,or a zero or a positive like okay,21:02.0,21:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15667,7,1,T1 ,,I can hear my voice like going all along it's like,21:06.0,21:11.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
15668,7,1,T1 ,,I can hear like it goes that,21:13.0,21:16.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,

15671,7,1,T1 ,I have no idea,,21:20.0,21:22.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
15672,7,1,T1 ,okay let's go back to the point,,21:22.0,21:25.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
15673,7,1,T1 ,so what you want to do is you want to pause filler make that nine a positive,,21:25.0,21:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15674,7,1,T1 ,,a positive so,21:30.0,21:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15675,7,1,T1 ,yes so positive nine negative,,21:32.0,21:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15676,7,1,T1 ,,so add eighteen and then,21:35.0,21:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15677,7,1,T1 ,I'm going to replace this because this makes no sense (sfx) (laughter),,21:38.0,21:46.0,00:08.0,SV,,,,,
15678,7,1,T1 ,,you just erased the problem (laughter),21:46.0,21:51.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
15679,7,1,T1 ,ops,,21:51.0,21:52.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
15680,7,1,T1 ,,there you go,21:52.0,21:53.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
15681,7,1,T1 ,,oh no,21:53.0,21:53.0,00:00.0,,SV,,,,
15682,7,1,T1 ,,that's because I wrote on it,21:53.0,21:56.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
15683,7,1,T1 ,,and you probably yeah,21:56.0,21:57.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
15684,7,1,T1 ,,oh gosh,21:57.0,21:57.0,00:00.0,,SV,,,,
15685,7,1,T1 ,,just like undo it,21:59.0,22:00.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
15686,7,1,T1 ,,there we are okay,22:02.0,22:03.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
15687,7,1,T1 ,ah,,22:04.0,22:04.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
15688,7,1,T1 ,,so are we trying to so how do you get the negative nine to a nine a positive,22:05.0,22:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15689,7,1,T1 ,,so you add eighteen wait because that would get you there,22:11.0,22:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15690,7,1,T1 ,no you have to keep the nine,,22:14.0,22:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15691,7,1,T1 ,so just do nine plus thirteen,,22:19.0,22:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15692,7,1,T1 ,,negative nine,22:22.0,22:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15693,7,1,T1 ,no positive nine,,22:23.0,22:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15694,7,1,T1 ,,but this is a negative nine,22:24.0,22:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15695,7,1,T1 ,,what do you mean,22:26.0,22:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15696,7,1,T1 ,yeah just I think don't you add it,,22:26.0,22:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15697,7,1,T1 ,,I think you add nine because then that will cancel out like positive and,22:30.0,22:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15698,7,1,T1 ,yeah add it,,22:34.0,22:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15699,7,1,T1 ,,so then that would be zero and so then,22:35.0,22:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15700,7,1,T1 ,no really,,22:38.0,22:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15701,7,1,T1 ,,yeah because if you add negative nine and then a positive nine like they cancel out,22:39.0,22:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15702,7,1,T1 ,,and just equal zero I think,22:45.0,22:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15703,7,1,T1 ,maybe well I know so,,22:48.0,22:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15704,7,1,T1 ,,(inaudible) and then you add listen,22:50.0,22:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15705,7,1,T1 ,,and then if you do one thing to one side you have to do it to the other,22:52.0,22:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15706,7,1,T1 ,,so you have to add nine to the side I think,22:55.0,22:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15707,7,1,T1 ,yeah you have to add nine to both sides,,23:00.0,23:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15708,7,1,T1 ,,yeah,23:03.0,23:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15709,7,1,T1 ,and then you get the pause filler variable and the number together,,23:04.0,23:11.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
15710,7,1,T1 ,and then it has one number on the other side,,23:12.0,23:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15711,7,1,T1 ,,so this is fifty and then this is,23:14.0,23:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15712,7,1,T1 ,good,,23:17.0,23:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15713,7,1,T1 ,oh my gosh,,23:17.0,23:19.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
15714,7,1,T1 ,okay I get it,,23:19.0,23:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15715,7,1,T1 ,I get it,,23:20.0,23:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15716,7,1,T1 ,okay so what you want to do is so you cancel out that nine,,23:21.0,23:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15717,7,1,T1 ,and then you add that nine where you got it,,23:26.0,23:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15718,7,1,T1 ,,so then forty-nine right,23:30.0,23:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15719,7,1,T1 ,no you add it to thirteen and forty-one,,23:31.0,23:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15720,7,1,T1 ,,wait so you add the nine to the thirteen and then negative nine and forty-one,23:35.0,23:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15721,7,1,T1 ,yeah,,23:39.0,23:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15722,7,1,T1 ,,okay,23:40.0,23:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15723,7,1,T1 ,so you want to add it to both sides,,23:42.0,23:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15724,7,1,T1 ,,but like but thirteen p is on the same side as negative nine,23:46.0,23:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15725,7,1,T1 ,well that's separate,,23:50.0,23:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15726,7,1,T1 ,that's like separate somehow,,23:51.0,23:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15727,7,1,T1 ,okay but like the paper says that it's separate,,23:53.0,23:56.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
15728,7,1,T1 ,I don't know how,,23:56.0,24:00.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
15729,7,1,T1 ,confusing okay,,24:00.0,24:01.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
15730,7,1,T1 ,,all right what does the paper say,24:02.0,24:08.0,00:06.0,,SV,,,,
15731,7,1,T1 ,,so the I don't know,24:09.0,24:10.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
15732,7,1,T1 ,it's not the exact answer to that so,,24:10.0,24:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15733,7,1,T1 ,,well yeah,24:12.0,24:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15734,7,1,T1 ,it's a different equation,,24:14.0,24:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15735,7,1,T1 ,so what I'm doing is I'm just switching up the numbers and variable,,24:16.0,24:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15736,7,1,T1 ,okay so what it says to do here is so you got thirteen p equals fifty,,24:21.0,24:30.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
15737,7,1,T1 ,so that is probably correct,,24:31.0,24:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15738,7,1,T1 ,I have no idea,,24:34.0,24:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15739,7,1,T1 ,,yeah but do we have to do we have to simplify it down to one p,24:35.0,24:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15740,7,1,T1 ,no not yet,,24:40.0,24:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15741,7,1,T1 ,okay so then you want to divide,,24:43.0,24:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15742,7,1,T1 ,,oh,24:46.0,24:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15743,7,1,T1 ,thirteen divided b thirteen divide and then,,24:46.0,24:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15744,7,1,T1 ,,and then fifty divided by thirteen,24:50.0,24:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15745,7,1,T1 ,no,,24:53.0,24:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15746,7,1,T1 ,you want to divide well yeah technically,,24:54.0,24:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15747,7,1,T1 ,,okay,24:57.0,24:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15748,7,1,T1 ,and that equals pause filler the p equals whatever,,24:58.0,25:04.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15749,7,1,T1 ,,fifteen divided by thirteen is right so because if you do or now we do thirteen p divided thirteen which is p,25:04.0,25:13.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
15750,7,1,T1 ,,I think yeah,25:14.0,25:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15751,7,1,T1 ,,and then fifty divided by thirteen,25:15.0,25:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15752,7,1,T1 ,,so we can probably just write that as a fraction right,25:17.0,25:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15753,7,1,T1 ,no you can't,,25:24.0,25:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15754,7,1,T1 ,,no,25:25.0,25:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15755,7,1,T1 ,no,,25:25.0,25:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15756,7,1,T1 ,,oh gosh okay (laughter),25:25.0,25:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15757,7,1,T1 ,you have to divide,,25:28.0,25:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15758,7,1,T1 ,,oh yeah okay so thirteen and then fifty,25:31.0,25:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15759,7,1,T1 ,,so what's the,25:35.0,25:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15760,7,1,T1 ,I think you should do the thinner pencil,,25:37.0,25:40.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,

15772,7,1,T1 ,,but thirteen doesn't go perfectly in the fifty does it,26:08.0,26:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,

15880,7,1,T2 ,,,35:29.0,45:14.0,09:45.0,,,,,,
15881,7,1,T2 ,,you're going to add you're going to like do the same thing except pause filler you're adding like y I think,35:30.0,35:38.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
15882,7,1,T2 ,,so,35:41.0,35:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15883,7,1,T2 ,,so add okay so pause filler,35:45.0,35:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15884,7,1,T2 ,,yeah wait yeah because you could then then you could cancel out the y,35:47.0,35:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
15885,7,1,T2 ,,so if you added y to both sides,35:54.0,35:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15886,7,1,T2 ,,then yeah just try doing that,35:57.0,36:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15887,7,1,T2 ,,adding y to both sides,36:00.0,36:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15888,7,1,T2 ,the actual weird y because I did not mean to do that,,36:02.0,36:07.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
15889,7,1,T2 ,,so then yeah and so then that would be twenty-three plus y,36:10.0,36:16.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15890,7,1,T2 ,wait well then that would be eighteen yeah wait,,36:16.0,36:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15891,7,1,T2 ,,yeah because it would cancel out because the negative y and the positive y just makes zero oh,36:19.0,36:25.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15892,7,1,T2 ,now wait,,36:27.0,36:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

15894,7,1,T2 ,it's like we're only in like seventh grade,,36:45.0,36:48.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
15895,7,1,T2 ,and we're only like twenty year olds,,36:49.0,36:50.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
15896,7,1,T2 ,it's like hi,,36:50.0,36:52.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
15897,7,1,T2 ,and I don't know you this is really scary okay,,36:52.0,36:57.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
15898,7,1,T2 ,,all right so if you added y to both sides the ys,36:57.0,37:05.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
15899,7,1,T2 ,I think it's adding eighteen,,37:05.0,37:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15900,7,1,T2 ,,well because if you added y to both sides then you would because you can have the negative y I don't think,37:10.0,37:21.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
15901,7,1,T2 ,,like because then if you add y to both sides,37:22.0,37:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15902,7,1,T2 ,,then pause filler then this the y on this side will become just zero,37:27.0,37:35.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
15903,7,1,T2 ,,sort of like have with the nine it's like you have negative nine plus nine equals zero,37:35.0,37:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15904,7,1,T2 ,,and then this will just become twenty-three plus y equals eighteen oh (laughter) plus y equals eighteen,37:38.0,37:49.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
15905,7,1,T2 ,,and then like and then you could probably subtract twenty-three from each side,37:49.0,37:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15906,7,1,T2 ,yeah,,37:56.0,37:56.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15907,7,1,T2 ,,you see here you want to try it,37:56.0,37:59.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
15908,7,1,T2 ,,and I'll like yeah,38:00.0,38:15.0,00:15.0,SV,,,,,
15909,7,1,T2 ,,so what's in the box,38:24.0,38:44.0,00:20.0,SV,,,,,
15910,7,1,T2 ,,(laughter) all right,38:45.0,38:53.0,00:08.0,SV,,,,,
15911,7,1,T2 ,,back to the problem (laughter),38:57.0,38:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15912,7,1,T2 ,,oh my gosh,38:58.0,39:01.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
15913,7,1,T2 ,,it's on my leg pause filler,39:01.0,39:02.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
15914,7,1,T2 ,,so,39:06.0,39:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15915,7,1,T2 ,,if we're,39:09.0,39:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15916,7,1,T2 ,,just trying to go through it,39:11.0,39:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15917,7,1,T2 ,,so if we add y to the side,39:13.0,39:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15918,7,1,T2 ,,and we add y to the other side as well,39:16.0,39:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15919,7,1,T2 ,,what do we have,39:19.0,39:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15920,7,1,T2 ,,oh,39:23.0,39:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15921,7,1,T2 ,I'm still chewing,,39:34.0,39:38.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
15922,7,1,T2 ,okay so I don't think we add y,,39:38.0,39:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15923,7,1,T2 ,I think we only add y once,,39:43.0,39:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15924,7,1,T2 ,and then it's eighteen plus twenty-three,,39:47.0,39:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15925,7,1,T2 ,,but yeah,39:53.0,39:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15926,7,1,T2 ,,wait what do you mean,39:54.0,39:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15927,7,1,T2 ,I'm like explaining the problem now (laughter),,39:57.0,40:00.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
15928,7,1,T2 ,okay so negative y plus eighteen equals twenty,,40:01.0,40:08.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
15929,7,1,T2 ,,negative,40:09.0,40:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15930,7,1,T2 ,,what do you mean,40:11.0,40:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15931,7,1,T2 ,,how did you get that because I don't,40:12.0,40:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15932,7,1,T2 ,it's the problem up here,,40:14.0,40:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15933,7,1,T2 ,,oh yeah,40:15.0,40:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15934,7,1,T2 ,,(laughter) I was like where did that come from,40:17.0,40:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15935,7,1,T2 ,okay so we would subtract y from eighteen negative y,,40:24.0,40:29.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15936,7,1,T2 ,and then we would equal twenty-three plus eighteen,,40:31.0,40:40.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
15937,7,1,T2 ,,but on here they have like the same form,40:43.0,40:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15938,7,1,T2 ,,and they add like y first like,40:47.0,40:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15939,7,1,T2 ,,around here we're pause filler it's like the same thing with different numbers,40:53.0,40:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15940,7,1,T2 ,,they just added like the number they've added like the x first,40:58.0,41:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15941,7,1,T2 ,,and then they add,41:03.0,41:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15942,7,1,T2 ,,and then they subtracted the number so,41:04.0,41:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15943,7,1,T2 ,so then it would be eighteen y,,41:11.0,41:18.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
15944,7,1,T2 ,,what do you mean (laughter),41:18.0,41:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15945,7,1,T2 ,y plus eighteen equals eighteen y,,41:20.0,41:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15946,7,1,T2 ,,negative y,41:23.0,41:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15947,7,1,T2 ,,remember it's negative,41:24.0,41:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15948,7,1,T2 ,then negative eighteen y,,41:28.0,41:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15949,7,1,T2 ,,yeah,41:30.0,41:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15950,7,1,T2 ,,all right negative yeah eighteen negative y what because like no y has to be positive,41:30.0,41:39.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
15951,7,1,T2 ,,doesn't it,41:43.0,41:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15952,7,1,T2 ,I don't know,,41:44.0,41:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15953,7,1,T2 ,,that's like start this thing fresh again,41:47.0,41:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15954,7,1,T2 ,,because it's like a mess (laughter),41:50.0,42:10.0,00:20.0,SV,,,,,
15955,7,1,T2 ,,okay so let's try like what I see on the paper,42:11.0,42:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15956,7,1,T2 ,,so let's try plus y on the side plus y on this side,42:15.0,42:24.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
15957,7,1,T2 ,don't you want to make the ink a little smaller,,42:24.0,42:27.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
15958,7,1,T2 ,,yeah I can try that,42:28.0,42:29.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
15959,7,1,T2 ,,here we go,42:31.0,42:32.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
15960,7,1,T2 ,,oh that's really strong,42:32.0,42:33.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
15961,7,1,T2 ,,okay there we go,42:33.0,42:36.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
15962,7,1,T2 ,,so now so if we add y on both sides what do we have,42:36.0,42:43.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
15963,7,1,T2 ,pause filler so well this is zero,,42:43.0,42:49.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15964,7,1,T2 ,,yeah that would cancel out,42:49.0,42:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15965,7,1,T2 ,and this is eighteen y,,42:52.0,42:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15966,7,1,T2 ,,so no,42:55.0,42:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15967,7,1,T2 ,,you won't need the,42:56.0,42:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15968,7,1,T2 ,how,,42:58.0,42:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15969,7,1,T2 ,,you wouldn't need the eighteen because you would add by each side,42:59.0,43:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
15970,7,1,T2 ,,so you would add y to each side of the equation,43:03.0,43:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15971,7,1,T2 ,,so you would add y to,43:06.0,43:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15972,7,1,T2 ,oh twenty-three,,43:07.0,43:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15973,7,1,T2 ,it's twenty-three y,,43:08.0,43:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15974,7,1,T2 ,,twenty-three plus y yeah,43:10.0,43:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15975,7,1,T2 ,,so now it's going to be eighteen because it equals twenty-three plus y,43:13.0,43:20.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
15976,7,1,T2 ,,and then,43:24.0,43:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15977,7,1,T2 ,,and then what do we do pause filler it's,43:28.0,43:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15978,7,1,T2 ,that was weird,,43:32.0,43:33.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
15979,7,1,T2 ,,what,43:34.0,43:34.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
15980,7,1,T2 ,someone was staring at me it was really scary,,43:34.0,43:39.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
15981,7,1,T2 ,,okay (laughter) so now we have that,43:39.0,43:46.0,00:07.0,SV,,,,,
15982,7,1,T2 ,,we can cancel out the twenty-three,43:47.0,43:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
15983,7,1,T2 ,,and then so we have y alone by subtracting twenty-three from each side,43:53.0,43:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
15984,7,1,T2 ,,so do that and then yeah,43:58.0,44:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15985,7,1,T2 ,,so what's eighteen minus twenty-three,44:01.0,44:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15986,7,1,T2 ,eight,,44:05.0,44:05.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15987,7,1,T2 ,,here let's just like write it out,44:06.0,44:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
15988,7,1,T2 ,,yeah eighteen minus twenty,44:21.0,44:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15989,7,1,T2 ,,it's going to be negative,44:22.0,44:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
15990,7,1,T2 ,I hate negative numbers,,44:25.0,44:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
15991,7,1,T2 ,they're so confusing,,44:27.0,44:31.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
15992,7,1,T2 ,huh I did a circle,,44:33.0,44:48.0,00:15.0,,SV,,,,
15993,7,1,T2 ,,okay,44:48.0,44:48.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
15994,7,1,T2 ,sort of (laughter),,44:49.0,44:50.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
15995,7,1,T2 ,,so then it would be negative fifteen equals y right,44:50.0,44:57.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
15996,7,1,T2 ,yeah,,44:58.0,44:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
15997,7,1,T2 ,,because if we did eighteen minus twenty-three because we canceled out the twenty-three by subtracting twenty-three from it so then it's just,44:59.0,45:06.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
15998,7,1,T2 ,oh I figured it out,,45:06.0,45:08.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
15999,7,1,T2 ,,yeah and then it's just negative fifteen equals y right,45:08.0,45:13.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16000,7,1,T2 ,when you press it the button,,45:15.0,45:17.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16001,7,1,T2 ,it draws it,,45:17.0,45:18.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16002,7,1,T2 ,,what do you mean,45:20.0,45:21.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16003,7,1,T2 ,press field not the small part of it but the larger,,45:21.0,45:26.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
16004,7,1,T2 ,no the button the bigger yeah,,45:27.0,45:31.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
16005,7,1,T2 ,and then start drawing without touching it,,45:31.0,45:34.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16006,7,1,T2 ,,wait,45:34.0,45:34.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16007,7,1,T2 ,,wait,45:36.0,45:36.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16008,7,1,T2 ,,I see that,45:40.0,45:43.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16009,7,1,T2 ,,it like makes really little lines though,45:43.0,45:50.0,00:07.0,SV,,,,,
16010,7,1,T2 ,,oh,45:50.0,45:51.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16011,7,1,T2 ,yeah,,45:51.0,45:52.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16012,7,1,T2 ,,that's cool,45:52.0,45:52.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16013,7,1,T2 ,I just tapped it,,45:56.0,46:01.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
16014,7,1,T2 ,that's really weird,,46:01.0,46:05.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
16015,7,1,T2 ,okay your face just got really big,,46:06.0,46:11.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
16016,7,1,T2 ,,really (laughter),46:11.0,46:12.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16017,7,1,T2 ,yeah,,46:12.0,46:13.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16018,7,1,T2 ,,ops okay pause filler I just pressed actually pressing it,46:13.0,46:17.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
16019,7,1,T2 ,,okay how do we go to the next thing,46:17.0,46:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16020,7,1,T2 ,don't you see the arrows that I've got on the page,,46:21.0,46:24.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16021,7,1,T2 ,,oh I did it okay,46:24.0,46:26.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16022,7,1,T2 ,,,46:27.0,54:02.0,07:35.0,,,,,,
16023,7,1,T2 ,,now,46:27.0,46:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16024,7,1,T2 ,,we got to do this,46:33.0,46:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16025,7,1,T2 ,yes,,46:37.0,46:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16026,7,1,T2 ,,start by (laughter) adding k,46:38.0,46:44.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16027,7,1,T2 ,,try adding k to each side of the equation,46:44.0,46:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16028,7,1,T2 ,that's pretty much getting rid of the ks,,46:49.0,46:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16029,7,1,T2 ,,well if you add k to this side,46:52.0,46:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16030,7,1,T2 ,,and you add k to this side,46:55.0,46:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16031,7,1,T2 ,,this will be canceled out,46:58.0,47:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16032,7,1,T2 ,,and just be zero,47:00.0,47:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16033,7,1,T2 ,,so it will be negative fourteen equals thirty-six,47:00.0,47:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16034,7,1,T2 ,,and then since we add another k to the k it would be plus two k,47:06.0,47:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16035,7,1,T2 ,,do you get that,47:10.0,47:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

16077,7,1,T2 ,,(laughter) if we added k to each side the left side of the equation would be fourteen negative fourteen because the other side cancels out because the ks cancel out,49:41.0,49:54.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
16078,7,1,T2 ,,and in the other side would be thirty-six,49:55.0,49:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16079,7,1,T2 ,,and then plus two k now that we added another k,49:57.0,50:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

16085,7,1,T2 ,,all right so now that we have the equation simplify down to a negative fourteen equals thirty-six plus two k,50:33.0,50:41.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16086,7,1,T2 ,,one minute,50:44.0,50:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

16102,7,1,T2 ,,we'll just have two k right here,52:01.0,52:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16103,7,1,T2 ,,and then figure out what negative fourteen minus thirty-one is or thirty-six because then that would be the answer pretty much,52:06.0,52:15.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
16104,7,1,T2 ,,and (inaudible) too but yeah,52:15.0,52:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

16215,7,2,S1 ,,you're in seventh grade,04:39.0,04:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,QE
16216,7,2,S1 ,,same,04:44.0,04:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,SD
16217,7,2,S1 ,,oh this mechanical pencil is I like mechanical pencils,04:46.0,04:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,SD
16218,7,2,S1 ,,but the lead always breaks like when you use it,04:51.0,04:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16219,7,2,S1 ,,because the lead always break,04:55.0,04:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

16224,7,2,S1 ,pause filler PUCS,,05:29.0,05:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16225,7,2,S1 ,,yeah did you (laughter),05:33.0,05:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16226,7,2,S1 ,,oh okay,05:33.0,05:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16227,7,2,S1 ,,wait can I just use this mouse,06:10.0,06:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16228,7,2,S1 ,,it's kind of very hard to like do,06:15.0,06:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16229,7,2,S1 ,,okay,06:21.0,06:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16230,7,2,S1 ,,okay I feel like I'm pause filler so I know what like to do,06:28.0,06:31.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16231,7,2,T1 ,,,06:29.0,26:39.0,20:10.0,,,,,,
16232,7,2,T1 ,,,06:29.0,12:17.0,05:48.0,,,,,,
16233,7,2,T1 ,,but I don't know how to like do it,06:31.0,06:33.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16234,7,2,T1 ,,because I know you have to do forty divided by three over seven but like,06:34.0,06:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16235,7,2,T1 ,let's see the cheat sheet and,,06:40.0,06:43.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16236,7,2,T1 ,,so you find the thing with like the matching thingy equation pause filler,06:43.0,06:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16237,7,2,T1 ,the matching thingy equation,,06:47.0,06:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16238,7,2,T1 ,I found that,,06:49.0,06:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16239,7,2,T1 ,it's the first one (inaudible),,06:50.0,06:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16240,7,2,T1 ,okay so first you have to multiply both sides by three over seven,,06:52.0,06:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16241,7,2,T1 ,,okay negative or positive,06:58.0,07:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16242,7,2,T1 ,positive,,07:04.0,07:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16243,7,2,T1 ,,oh that's really bad,07:04.0,07:07.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16244,7,2,T1 ,I have a mouse,,07:09.0,07:14.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,

16248,7,2,T1 ,,when you multiply we does that cancel out,07:24.0,07:29.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16249,7,2,T1 ,,does the three over seven cancel out when you multiply it,07:29.0,07:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16250,7,2,T1 ,,I have no idea (laughter),07:31.0,07:36.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
16251,7,2,T1 ,,this is so good,07:38.0,07:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16252,7,2,T1 ,I'm using a mouse (laughter),,07:39.0,07:43.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
16253,7,2,T1 ,it's nine over forty-nine,,07:43.0,07:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16254,7,2,T1 ,,what oh three over seven,07:48.0,07:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16255,7,2,T1 ,yeah and then we have to do three over,,07:50.0,07:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16256,7,2,T1 ,,we (inaudible) three wait three over seven times three over,07:55.0,07:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16257,7,2,T1 ,,oh yeah okay okay,07:57.0,07:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16258,7,2,T1 ,both sides,,07:59.0,07:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16259,7,2,T1 ,okay and now we have to do forty over one times three over seven equals seven,,08:01.0,08:13.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
16260,7,2,T1 ,what's all that one hundred twenty,,08:14.0,08:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16261,7,2,T1 ,one hundred twenty over seven,,08:20.0,08:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16262,7,2,T1 ,seven divided by one hundred twenty is,,08:25.0,08:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16263,7,2,T1 ,,a fraction,08:29.0,08:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16264,7,2,T1 ,this is so confusing,,08:30.0,08:33.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16265,7,2,T1 ,,wait seven divided by one hundred twenty,08:33.0,08:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16266,7,2,T1 ,yeah,,08:35.0,08:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16267,7,2,T1 ,,just write it as a fraction just write it like,08:36.0,08:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16268,7,2,T1 ,that is a fraction,,08:39.0,08:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16269,7,2,T1 ,but I have to write it as a mixed fraction,,08:40.0,08:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16270,7,2,T1 ,,you mean like a you have to divide it,08:43.0,08:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16271,7,2,T1 ,well it's pretty much a division problem,,08:47.0,08:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16272,7,2,T1 ,,okay,08:52.0,08:52.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16273,7,2,T1 ,so if I wrote it like this,,08:52.0,08:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16274,7,2,T1 ,,I can't see,08:56.0,08:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16275,7,2,T1 ,,wait do I have to move down wait,09:00.0,09:03.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16276,7,2,T1 ,,oh my gosh,09:03.0,09:05.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16277,7,2,T1 ,,so pause filler,09:05.0,09:06.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16278,7,2,T1 ,,can I scroll down,09:06.0,09:07.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16279,7,2,T1 ,,oh here we go okay (laughter),09:07.0,09:09.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16280,7,2,T1 ,,I'm trying to scroll down,09:09.0,09:14.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
16281,7,2,T1 ,,did you scroll down to,09:14.0,09:16.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16282,7,2,T1 ,,oh oh oh there we go,09:16.0,09:18.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16283,7,2,T1 ,,I see it okay,09:18.0,09:20.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16284,7,2,T1 ,yay okay so pretty much what you have to well it's pretty,,09:20.0,09:29.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
16285,7,2,T1 ,it is a division problem do you see how it's like,,09:29.0,09:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16286,7,2,T1 ,this is like a division problem,,09:33.0,09:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16287,7,2,T1 ,so if I read it another way,,09:36.0,09:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16288,7,2,T1 ,I can write it one,,09:38.0,09:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16289,7,2,T1 ,,how did you get to one hundred twenty divided by four,09:40.0,09:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16290,7,2,T1 ,I pause filler multiplied forty over one which is pretty much forty pause filler,,09:43.0,09:49.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16291,7,2,T1 ,,but why did you do that,09:50.0,09:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16292,7,2,T1 ,because it equals the whole number forty,,09:52.0,09:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16293,7,2,T1 ,if it was one over forty that would be a fraction a different kind of number,,09:56.0,10:02.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16294,7,2,T1 ,but since it's not it's a whole number,,10:02.0,10:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16295,7,2,T1 ,so that's how I learned it so yeah,,10:06.0,10:08.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16296,7,2,T1 ,,okay do you want to like erase this to make more room,10:08.0,10:13.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
16297,7,2,T1 ,yeah I can do that,,10:13.0,10:15.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16298,7,2,T1 ,,okay I'm really bad at the eraser (laughter),10:15.0,10:18.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16299,7,2,T1 ,,wait I'm trying to find the eraser thing,10:19.0,10:22.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,

16307,7,2,T1 ,,wait yeah I think it's like a dark green,10:40.0,10:42.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16308,7,2,T1 ,okay,,10:43.0,10:44.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16309,7,2,T1 ,,or now it's only black,10:44.0,10:47.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16310,7,2,T1 ,,there we go okay okay,10:47.0,10:52.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
16311,7,2,T1 ,mine would be mint green okay,,10:52.0,10:53.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16312,7,2,T1 ,so we were at one twenty,,10:53.0,10:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16313,7,2,T1 ,,yeah here look at the equation in the cheat sheet again,10:58.0,11:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16314,7,2,T1 ,,I mean we were like okay,11:00.0,11:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16315,7,2,T1 ,,let's go through the steps so (laughter) just to show it to me okay,11:01.0,11:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16316,7,2,T1 ,,mm-hmm,11:04.0,11:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

16320,7,2,T1 ,,what one twenty,11:18.0,11:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16321,7,2,T1 ,one twenty (laughter) (inaudible) sorry,,11:20.0,11:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16322,7,2,T1 ,pause filler what was the fraction again seven,,11:25.0,11:31.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16323,7,2,T1 ,that is the answer,,11:32.0,11:40.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16324,7,2,T1 ,,how,11:40.0,11:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16325,7,2,T1 ,,hey wait did you do,11:40.0,11:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16326,7,2,T1 ,I don't know (laughter),,11:42.0,11:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16327,7,2,T1 ,,did you do forty time three,11:43.0,11:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16328,7,2,T1 ,uh-uh this whole thing,,11:46.0,11:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16329,7,2,T1 ,I did it time this,,11:48.0,11:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16330,7,2,T1 ,,the what,11:50.0,11:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

16333,7,2,T1 ,so I just do three over seven times that over four over one,,11:56.0,12:03.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
16334,7,2,T1 ,,but why did you wait,12:03.0,12:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16335,7,2,T1 ,,can you just keep it forty,12:06.0,12:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16336,7,2,T1 ,no,,12:08.0,12:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16337,7,2,T1 ,but well a fraction is easier when you do,,12:08.0,12:13.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16338,7,2,T1 ,,oh you just do it over one to make it easier yeah okay,12:13.0,12:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16339,7,2,T1 ,so yeah okay next problem,,12:17.0,12:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16340,7,2,T1 ,,,12:18.0,18:47.0,06:29.0,,,,,,
16341,7,2,T1 ,,okay fourteen equals three okay (inaudible),12:20.0,12:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16342,7,2,T1 ,okay got it,,12:24.0,12:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16343,7,2,T1 ,I got it,,12:25.0,12:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16344,7,2,T1 ,,you have to do three eight pause filler on each side times three eight on each side,12:26.0,12:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16345,7,2,T1 ,yes you got it,,12:31.0,12:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16346,7,2,T1 ,,oh okay,12:32.0,12:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16347,7,2,T1 ,okay,,12:34.0,12:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16348,7,2,T1 ,,can we just do some mental math okay,12:34.0,12:38.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
16349,7,2,T1 ,,that would be nine over sixty-four,12:38.0,12:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16350,7,2,T1 ,,I think,12:41.0,12:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16351,7,2,T1 ,,yeah nine over sixty oh my gosh nine over sixty-four k,12:43.0,12:51.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16352,7,2,T1 ,why don't you just use this,,12:51.0,12:52.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16353,7,2,T1 ,,what,12:52.0,12:54.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16354,7,2,T1 ,this it's neither,,12:54.0,12:57.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16355,7,2,T1 ,,what like a pencil,12:57.0,13:00.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16356,7,2,T1 ,,is that the type of pencil,13:00.0,13:02.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16357,7,2,T1 ,you just how about you just my like writing and then,,13:02.0,13:06.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
16358,7,2,T1 ,so it's neither and you can actually understand it,,13:06.0,13:09.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16359,7,2,T1 ,,what do you mean,13:10.0,13:11.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16360,7,2,T1 ,pause filler hold up,,13:12.0,13:14.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16361,7,2,T1 ,,here maybe if I just like write bigger,13:14.0,13:18.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
16362,7,2,T1 ,that just takes up more room,,13:19.0,13:20.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16363,7,2,T1 ,I can write for you,,13:21.0,13:22.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16364,7,2,T1 ,,it's fine,13:24.0,13:25.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16365,7,2,T1 ,,see that works that works,13:25.0,13:27.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16366,7,2,T1 ,,so nine over sixty-four k equals,13:27.0,13:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16367,7,2,T1 ,,and then we have to do fourteen times three over eight right,13:32.0,13:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16368,7,2,T1 ,multiply by both sides,,13:37.0,13:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16369,7,2,T1 ,so you want to multiply three over eight by fourteen and times that by itself,,13:41.0,13:47.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16370,7,2,T1 ,,okay let's do it,13:47.0,13:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16371,7,2,T1 ,,okay so you already have it written down,13:48.0,13:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16372,7,2,T1 ,,fourteen so fourteen time three,13:50.0,13:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16373,7,2,T1 ,,I'm just going to use a calculator,13:52.0,13:55.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,

16450,7,2,T1 ,,pause filler the last time didn't we do three over pause filler didn't we multiply each side by three over eight,18:32.0,18:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16451,7,2,T1 ,okay so let's go back to the first problem,,18:42.0,18:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16452,7,2,T1 ,okay so we did this wrong sorry,,18:47.0,18:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

16475,7,2,T1 ,,or should we just keep the fraction,20:04.0,20:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16476,7,2,T1 ,,or do we have to divide it,20:06.0,20:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16477,7,2,T1 ,we leave that because it's done,,20:09.0,20:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

16538,7,2,T1 ,okay do you want the next pause filler thing,,23:13.0,23:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16539,7,2,T1 ,,should we just like finish this one though,23:19.0,23:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16540,7,2,T1 ,so did you add eighteen to both sides,,23:24.0,23:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16541,7,2,T1 ,,pause filler yeah and,23:28.0,23:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16542,7,2,T1 ,eighteen plus fifty-two,,23:29.0,23:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16543,7,2,T1 ,,is seventy,23:31.0,23:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16544,7,2,T1 ,,yeah I got that,23:32.0,23:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16545,7,2,T1 ,okay so then you have to take the excuse me pause filler to the fraction,,23:34.0,23:42.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16546,7,2,T1 ,and then you have to multiply it on both sides,,23:42.0,23:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16547,7,2,T1 ,,again like we did the last one,23:47.0,23:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16548,7,2,T1 ,but you have to make it inproper so flip it,,23:49.0,23:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16549,7,2,T1 ,,okay okay so negative three over two,23:52.0,23:57.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16550,7,2,T1 ,,so that would cancel out right,23:57.0,23:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16551,7,2,T1 ,wait hold up,,23:59.0,24:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16552,7,2,T1 ,,if I did negative two over three time three negative three over two,24:01.0,24:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16553,7,2,T1 ,,that would cancel out right,24:04.0,24:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16554,7,2,T1 ,pause filler,,24:06.0,24:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

16563,7,2,T1 ,,pause filler I mean two over three (inaudible),24:36.0,24:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16564,7,2,T1 ,over two equals what,,24:38.0,24:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16565,7,2,T1 ,,okay let's think,24:41.0,24:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16566,7,2,T1 ,,two hundred ten,24:42.0,24:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

16568,7,2,T1 ,no,,24:50.0,24:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16569,7,2,T1 ,,like now because three time seven is twenty-one yeah two thousand one hundred what pause filler,24:50.0,24:59.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
16570,7,2,T1 ,hold up let me see,,24:59.0,25:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16571,7,2,T1 ,two ten,,25:00.0,25:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16572,7,2,T1 ,,but that doesn't seem right,25:03.0,25:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16573,7,2,T1 ,,like seventy times three,25:09.0,25:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16574,7,2,T1 ,,oh yeah actually yeah okay,25:10.0,25:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

16576,7,2,T1 ,and then we have to divide it,,25:17.0,25:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16577,7,2,T1 ,,or can't we just keep it as a fraction,25:21.0,25:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16578,7,2,T1 ,,we can't,25:25.0,25:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

16584,7,2,T1 ,,yup I'll just write a hundred and five,25:38.0,25:43.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16585,7,2,T1 ,,pause filler that's a really bad zero a hundred,25:43.0,25:50.0,00:07.0,,SV,,,,

16592,7,2,T1 ,,,26:05.0,26:39.0,00:34.0,,,,,,
16593,7,2,T1 ,,okie doke now last one we added eighteen to each side,26:12.0,26:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16594,7,2,T1 ,,now we're subtracting eighteen no thirteen right,26:17.0,26:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,

16598,7,2,T1 ,,and then we'll just make the other one bigger,26:29.0,26:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16599,7,2,T1 ,,so should we just subtract that,26:30.0,26:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

16701,7,2,T2 ,,so write down like times x,34:42.0,34:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16702,7,2,T2 ,okay that's disgusting,,34:45.0,34:46.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16703,7,2,T2 ,,Jesus,34:49.0,34:50.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16704,7,2,T2 ,okay,,34:50.0,34:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16705,7,2,T2 ,,just do like times x times x,34:51.0,35:01.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
16706,7,2,T2 ,,wait am I green,35:02.0,35:04.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16707,7,2,T2 ,you're mm-hmm,,35:04.0,35:08.0,00:04.0,,SV,,,,
16708,7,2,T2 ,,wait,35:08.0,35:08.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16709,7,2,T2 ,,yeah here let me make it more green okay,35:10.0,35:12.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16710,7,2,T2 ,,here we go,35:12.0,35:13.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16711,7,2,T2 ,,times x well times x okay well,35:13.0,35:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16712,7,2,T2 ,,so then well what do you think is going to happen,35:18.0,35:24.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16713,7,2,T2 ,,done,35:25.0,35:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16714,7,2,T2 ,,and then you multiply x each side,35:27.0,35:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16715,7,2,T2 ,the x on the bottom of the fraction goes away,,35:34.0,35:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16716,7,2,T2 ,,yeah so,35:38.0,35:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16717,7,2,T2 ,and then it's just one,,35:38.0,35:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16718,7,2,T2 ,,yeah and then the other side,35:40.0,35:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16719,7,2,T2 ,one times twenty-five which equals twenty-fivex,,35:42.0,35:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16720,7,2,T2 ,,whoa,35:46.0,35:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16721,7,2,T2 ,,now twenty-five times x,35:47.0,35:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16722,7,2,T2 ,yeah twenty-fivex,,35:50.0,35:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16723,7,2,T2 ,,wait,35:53.0,35:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16724,7,2,T2 ,sorry I had a very sour one in my mouth okay,,35:55.0,35:58.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16725,7,2,T2 ,equals twenty-five x,,35:59.0,36:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16726,7,2,T2 ,,yeah but then,36:05.0,36:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16727,7,2,T2 ,,yeah I think it's that,36:07.0,36:20.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
16728,7,2,T2 ,,no because you want to get x alone,36:21.0,36:29.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16729,7,2,T2 ,,so maybe if you divide each side,36:29.0,36:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16730,7,2,T2 ,,yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay,36:34.0,36:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16731,7,2,T2 ,,you have to divide each side by twenty-five because then,36:35.0,36:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16732,7,2,T2 ,,x on this side is going to just is going to be,36:39.0,36:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16733,7,2,T2 ,,hello it's,36:44.0,36:45.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16734,7,2,T2 ,you can actually read that,,36:45.0,36:48.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16735,7,2,T2 ,,yeah,36:48.0,36:48.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16736,7,2,T2 ,how,,36:50.0,36:51.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16737,7,2,T2 ,,I just can,36:55.0,36:55.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16738,7,2,T2 ,,but going on okay,36:57.0,36:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16739,7,2,T2 ,,if we divide,37:01.0,37:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16740,7,2,T2 ,you're like wow,,37:05.0,37:06.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16741,7,2,T2 ,this is like you're skipping like all over like,,37:06.0,37:11.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
16742,7,2,T2 ,it's going very slow,,37:11.0,37:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16743,7,2,T2 ,,like I'm moving like is it,37:12.0,37:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16744,7,2,T2 ,you move and then it like stops,,37:14.0,37:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16745,7,2,T2 ,,yeah I don't know okay,37:17.0,37:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16746,7,2,T2 ,,it's the sour stuff,37:25.0,37:27.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16747,7,2,T2 ,,okay (laughter) in fact it's actually not that sour,37:31.0,37:35.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
16748,7,2,T2 ,,but okay so if we divide each side by twenty-five so because then what will happen to this side,37:35.0,37:41.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16749,7,2,T2 ,,is it will just be x alone,37:41.0,37:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16750,7,2,T2 ,,and that will be,37:42.0,37:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16751,7,2,T2 ,,what will that be,37:43.0,37:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16752,7,2,T2 ,onex,,37:46.0,37:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16753,7,2,T2 ,,one over twenty-five,37:47.0,37:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16754,7,2,T2 ,,because if we're dividing this by twenty-five,37:49.0,37:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16755,7,2,T2 ,,then it will be one divided by twenty-five which is that,37:52.0,37:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16756,7,2,T2 ,,and then divide that by twenty-five,37:55.0,37:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16757,7,2,T2 ,,and then it's just going to be x alone,37:57.0,37:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16758,7,2,T2 ,,so whatever twenty-five equals x,37:59.0,38:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16759,7,2,T2 ,,I have two left,38:05.0,38:06.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16760,7,2,T2 ,,how many do you have left,38:06.0,38:07.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16761,7,2,T2 ,I have no idea,,38:07.0,38:09.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16762,7,2,T2 ,,(laughter) all right let's go to the next one,38:09.0,38:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16763,7,2,T2 ,,,38:17.0,45:33.0,07:16.0,,,,,,
16764,7,2,T2 ,,okay I know what you do for this but,38:17.0,38:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16765,7,2,T2 ,I do too,,38:21.0,38:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16766,7,2,T2 ,,what do you do,38:22.0,38:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16767,7,2,T2 ,you have to add them to both sides,,38:22.0,38:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16768,7,2,T2 ,seventeen to both sides,,38:24.0,38:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16769,7,2,T2 ,,okay well do that,38:26.0,38:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16770,7,2,T2 ,I'm going to be red,,38:32.0,38:33.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16771,7,2,T2 ,,red well,38:33.0,38:34.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16772,7,2,T2 ,,I think you're supposed to be black,38:34.0,38:37.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16773,7,2,T2 ,who cares,,38:38.0,38:38.0,00:00.0,,SV,,,,
16774,7,2,T2 ,,rebel (laughter),38:39.0,38:39.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16775,7,2,T2 ,,just try that,38:39.0,38:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16776,7,2,T2 ,,no no you don't have to multiply,38:42.0,38:49.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
16777,7,2,T2 ,,you just have to add,38:49.0,39:00.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
16778,7,2,T2 ,,like yeah let me show you,39:00.0,39:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16779,7,2,T2 ,,so you add seventeen to this side,39:06.0,39:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16780,7,2,T2 ,,then that will cancel out right,39:09.0,39:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16781,7,2,T2 ,yeah,,39:11.0,39:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16782,7,2,T2 ,,so you can just all right,39:12.0,39:12.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16783,7,2,T2 ,,and then if you add seventeen to this side,39:13.0,39:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16784,7,2,T2 ,,what's it get us,39:16.0,39:23.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
16785,7,2,T2 ,,eighty,39:25.0,39:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16786,7,2,T2 ,what you said eighty,,39:25.0,39:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16787,7,2,T2 ,,yeah eighty,39:26.0,39:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16788,7,2,T2 ,,so right now it's negative negative three over y,39:28.0,39:36.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16789,7,2,T2 ,did you hear that,,39:36.0,39:39.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16790,7,2,T2 ,,what was that,39:39.0,39:40.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16791,7,2,T2 ,what,,39:41.0,39:42.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16792,7,2,T2 ,,that like like what,39:42.0,39:45.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16793,7,2,T2 ,I just burped,,39:45.0,39:46.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16794,7,2,T2 ,,oh I did not hear that okay,39:46.0,39:48.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16795,7,2,T2 ,okay good,,39:48.0,39:50.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16796,7,2,T2 ,,so right now negative three,39:50.0,39:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16797,7,2,T2 ,,we're not going to write it,39:52.0,39:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16798,7,2,T2 ,,negative three over y equals pause filler eight,39:53.0,39:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16799,7,2,T2 ,I can write with the back of the pen,,39:57.0,40:00.0,00:03.0,,SV,,,,
16800,7,2,T2 ,,so then what we're supposed to do is multiply,40:00.0,40:08.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16801,7,2,T2 ,,I like this stuff on the bottom,40:08.0,40:13.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,
16802,7,2,T2 ,,it's like try it,40:13.0,40:16.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16803,7,2,T2 ,,it's like sweet but like sour,40:16.0,40:18.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16804,7,2,T2 ,yeah I don't like sour things,,40:18.0,40:20.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16805,7,2,T2 ,,you don't,40:21.0,40:21.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16806,7,2,T2 ,,it's actually like really good okay,40:23.0,40:30.0,00:07.0,SV,,,,,
16807,7,2,T2 ,,so if we multiply each side by x then,40:30.0,40:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16808,7,2,T2 ,,what's going to happen,40:37.0,40:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16809,7,2,T2 ,(sfx),,40:41.0,40:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16810,7,2,T2 ,,so if you multiply negative three over y not by x by y,40:42.0,40:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16811,7,2,T2 ,,if we do negative three over y times y,40:47.0,40:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16812,7,2,T2 ,,what's going to happen,40:50.0,40:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16813,7,2,T2 ,,it's going to be gone,40:54.0,40:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16814,7,2,T2 ,,the y is going to be gone,40:56.0,40:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16815,7,2,T2 ,,it's going to fly away,40:59.0,41:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16816,7,2,T2 ,I was kidding there (laughter),,41:00.0,41:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16817,7,2,T2 ,,so here write down negative three,41:02.0,41:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16818,7,2,T2 ,,because if we so if we do negative y times negative three over y,41:04.0,41:08.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16819,7,2,T2 ,,so just write negative three,41:08.0,41:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16820,7,2,T2 ,,and then just write eighty times y,41:10.0,41:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16821,7,2,T2 ,,and then that's our thing,41:15.0,41:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16822,7,2,T2 ,,wait no it's not,41:17.0,41:18.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16823,7,2,T2 ,,wait yes it is,41:18.0,41:18.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16824,7,2,T2 ,,wait no it's not,41:18.0,41:19.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16825,7,2,T2 ,,no it's not,41:19.0,41:20.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16826,7,2,T2 ,,I got this,41:20.0,41:21.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16827,7,2,T2 ,,okay I was like no it's not,41:21.0,41:23.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16828,7,2,T2 ,,it's going to be so,41:23.0,41:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16829,7,2,T2 ,,right now this is not not the mechanical pencil,41:24.0,41:28.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
16830,7,2,T2 ,,so right now it's negative three equals,41:28.0,41:36.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16831,7,2,T2 ,,negative three equals eighty eighty x eighty y,41:37.0,41:42.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16832,7,2,T2 ,,and then what we do is we divide,41:42.0,41:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16833,7,2,T2 ,,if we want to get y alone what do we do,41:46.0,41:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16834,7,2,T2 ,you have to subtract or add,,41:50.0,41:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16835,7,2,T2 ,,no you have to divide,41:53.0,41:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16836,7,2,T2 ,what you said,,41:58.0,41:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16837,7,2,T2 ,,yeah,41:59.0,42:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16838,7,2,T2 ,,so then what we're going to so we have negative three equals eighty pause filler y,42:00.0,42:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16839,7,2,T2 ,,so then we're going to divide by eighty on each side,42:06.0,42:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16840,7,2,T2 ,,and so it's going to be negative pause filler three over eighty,42:09.0,42:15.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16841,7,2,T2 ,,because if we're dividing that,42:15.0,42:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16842,7,2,T2 ,,and then since we divided the other side by eighty,42:17.0,42:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16843,7,2,T2 ,,it's going to be pause filler it's just going to be y now,42:21.0,42:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16844,7,2,T2 ,,so what's it all equal,42:25.0,42:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16845,7,2,T2 ,you stumped me,,42:30.0,42:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16846,7,2,T2 ,,I stumped you,42:32.0,42:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16847,7,2,T2 ,I have no idea where you are,,42:34.0,42:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16848,7,2,T2 ,,okay let me explain everything we did okay,42:36.0,42:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16849,7,2,T2 ,,just like I don't feel like writing the whole thing again,42:40.0,42:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16850,7,2,T2 ,,but I'll just explain it so,42:42.0,42:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16851,7,2,T2 ,wait hold on are we here,,42:44.0,42:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16852,7,2,T2 ,,here do you want me to just go from the very beginning,42:47.0,42:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16853,7,2,T2 ,no,,42:50.0,42:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16854,7,2,T2 ,,where did you get lost,42:51.0,42:56.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16855,7,2,T2 ,all of the writing,,42:56.0,42:58.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16856,7,2,T2 ,I can't,,42:59.0,43:00.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16857,7,2,T2 ,,okay so what we did first is we added eighteen to each side,43:00.0,43:07.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
16858,7,2,T2 ,,you know that right,43:07.0,43:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16859,7,2,T2 ,uh-huh,,43:08.0,43:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16860,7,2,T2 ,,so then on the left side we have negative three over y,43:10.0,43:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16861,7,2,T2 ,,and then on the other side we had eighty,43:14.0,43:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16862,7,2,T2 ,,because we added to the seventeen cancelled out yeah,43:17.0,43:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16863,7,2,T2 ,,and then what we did is we divided each side by y yeah,43:22.0,43:30.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16864,7,2,T2 ,,and then what happened is the negative three over y just became negative three,43:30.0,43:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16865,7,2,T2 ,,and six and eighty became eighty times y,43:35.0,43:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16866,7,2,T2 ,,so at this point it was negative three equals eighty times y,43:39.0,43:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16867,7,2,T2 ,,and then what happened was we divided so we had pause filler,43:44.0,43:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16868,7,2,T2 ,,let me just write this out,43:49.0,43:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16869,7,2,T2 ,,so we had negative three,43:51.0,43:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16870,7,2,T2 ,,since pause filler negative three equals eighty times y,43:53.0,44:01.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16871,7,2,T2 ,,oh my gosh,44:02.0,44:04.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16872,7,2,T2 ,,eighty times y,44:04.0,44:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16873,7,2,T2 ,,let's just pretend that says eighty times y okay,44:05.0,44:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16874,7,2,T2 ,,because we got there because we had multiplied times y on each side,44:09.0,44:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16875,7,2,T2 ,,and it became negative three equals eighty y,44:14.0,44:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16876,7,2,T2 ,,you get that,44:16.0,44:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16877,7,2,T2 ,,you get that,44:20.0,44:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16878,7,2,T2 ,,you get that,44:21.0,44:22.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16879,7,2,T2 ,,you get that,44:22.0,44:23.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16880,7,2,T2 ,,you get that,44:23.0,44:24.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16881,7,2,T2 ,hold up,,44:24.0,44:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16882,7,2,T2 ,go back to eighty times y,,44:25.0,44:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16883,7,2,T2 ,what does it equal,,44:26.0,44:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16884,7,2,T2 ,,we don't do eighty times y,44:29.0,44:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16885,7,2,T2 ,,what we do next is the fourth like,44:31.0,44:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16886,7,2,T2 ,,we want to get y alone,44:33.0,44:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16887,7,2,T2 ,,and right now y is with eighty,44:35.0,44:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16888,7,2,T2 ,,so you have to divide,44:37.0,44:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16889,7,2,T2 ,,if you do eighty if eighty times y if you do eighty times y divided by eight,44:38.0,44:44.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16890,7,2,T2 ,,it just becomes y,44:44.0,44:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16891,7,2,T2 ,,because the eighty divided eighty just cancels out and then becomes y,44:46.0,44:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16892,7,2,T2 ,,so you get that,44:50.0,44:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16893,7,2,T2 ,yeah,,44:52.0,44:52.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16894,7,2,T2 ,,yeah so it's just y on the right side,44:53.0,44:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16895,7,2,T2 ,,and then we also have to do pause filler divide eighty on the other side,44:57.0,45:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16896,7,2,T2 ,,so then it's just negative three divided by eighty,45:02.0,45:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16897,7,2,T2 ,,so the final thing do you,45:04.0,45:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16898,7,2,T2 ,,what is it,45:06.0,45:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16899,7,2,T2 ,,negative three over eighty,45:09.0,45:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16900,7,2,T2 ,I can't do math that fast,,45:13.0,45:15.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16901,7,2,T2 ,,no because like what I just said,45:15.0,45:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16902,7,2,T2 ,,it's negative three over eighty equals y,45:19.0,45:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16903,7,2,T2 ,,oh I've been using the wrong side,45:21.0,45:25.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
16904,7,2,T2 ,,I was using the other side,45:25.0,45:28.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16905,7,2,T2 ,,I probably looked like an idiot,45:28.0,45:34.0,00:06.0,SV,,,,,
16906,7,2,T2 ,,okay do you want to go onto the next one,45:34.0,45:41.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
16907,7,2,T2 ,,,45:34.0,50:13.0,04:39.0,,,,,,
16908,7,2,T2 ,,how do you like get that away (laughter),45:41.0,45:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16909,7,2,T2 ,,okay do you know what to do now,45:45.0,45:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16910,7,2,T2 ,we have to subtract forty fifty-four sorry pause filler (laughter),,45:49.0,45:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16911,7,2,T2 ,,I just like dropped it,45:53.0,45:56.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16912,7,2,T2 ,,why is that scaring me,45:57.0,45:58.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16913,7,2,T2 ,,it's like I'm going to break it,45:58.0,45:59.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16914,7,2,T2 ,,okay I'm not going to do that,45:59.0,46:00.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16915,7,2,T2 ,,yeah so write that down subtract fifty-four from each side,46:00.0,46:09.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
16916,7,2,T2 ,,I just moved my little box where like I am,46:10.0,46:21.0,00:11.0,SV,,,,,
16917,7,2,T2 ,,I just moved it,46:21.0,46:21.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16918,7,2,T2 ,,I don't remember like mess up,46:23.0,46:26.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16919,7,2,T2 ,,oh my gosh,46:26.0,46:27.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16920,7,2,T2 ,,there we go okay,46:27.0,46:29.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16921,7,2,T2 ,,so you just subtract fifty-four from each side,46:30.0,46:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16922,7,2,T2 ,,because then you'll get rid of the fifty-four on the one side,46:34.0,46:40.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16923,7,2,T2 ,,okay so then it's just yeah four over k equals,46:42.0,46:55.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
16924,7,2,T2 ,,and then what is one hundred sixteen minus fifty-four,46:55.0,47:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16925,7,2,T2 ,,sixty-two,47:00.0,47:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16926,7,2,T2 ,I was about to say that,,47:05.0,47:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16927,7,2,T2 ,,okay so right now yeah so then what we have to do is,47:08.0,47:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
16928,7,2,T2 ,,what do you think we have to do,47:15.0,47:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16929,7,2,T2 ,,just what we have to do,47:19.0,47:27.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
16930,7,2,T2 ,,how do we get the four all alone,47:27.0,47:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16931,7,2,T2 ,the what,,47:32.0,47:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16932,7,2,T2 ,,the four,47:33.0,47:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16933,7,2,T2 ,,how do you get the four alone,47:33.0,47:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16934,7,2,T2 ,oh I was about to be like I don't get it,,47:34.0,47:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16935,7,2,T2 ,okay so you have to divide,,47:37.0,47:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16936,7,2,T2 ,,you have to multiply,47:39.0,47:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16937,7,2,T2 ,whatever same thing,,47:42.0,47:43.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16938,7,2,T2 ,pause filler okay,,47:44.0,47:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16939,7,2,T2 ,,so you have to do yeah so multiply k by each side,47:45.0,47:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16940,7,2,T2 ,,so then on the left side,47:48.0,47:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16941,7,2,T2 ,that was really weird oh my gosh,,47:50.0,47:55.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
16942,7,2,T2 ,,it looks like a highlighter,47:55.0,47:56.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16943,7,2,T2 ,it is,,47:57.0,47:57.0,00:00.0,,SV,,,,
16944,7,2,T2 ,but did you see what it looked like,,47:57.0,47:59.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
16945,7,2,T2 ,,no,48:01.0,48:01.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16946,7,2,T2 ,good,,48:02.0,48:02.0,00:00.0,,SV,,,,
16947,7,2,T2 ,,okay,48:05.0,48:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16948,7,2,T2 ,,so if we multiply k to each side we'll get four all alone,48:08.0,48:14.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16949,7,2,T2 ,,and then you'll have sixty-two k,48:14.0,48:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16950,7,2,T2 ,,so can you write that down,48:16.0,48:22.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
16951,7,2,T2 ,,equals four,48:25.0,48:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16952,7,2,T2 ,,okay now we're not done yet,48:33.0,48:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16953,7,2,T2 ,,what do we have to do,48:35.0,48:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16954,7,2,T2 ,divide it,,48:37.0,48:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16955,7,2,T2 ,I have no idea,,48:38.0,48:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16956,7,2,T2 ,,wait oh one minute let me check,48:41.0,48:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
16957,7,2,T2 ,,yeah you're right divide it,48:44.0,48:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16958,7,2,T2 ,,wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait,48:46.0,48:48.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
16959,7,2,T2 ,,yeah,48:48.0,48:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16960,7,2,T2 ,,but what do you think we have to divide it by,48:48.0,49:01.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
16961,7,2,T2 ,,guess what we have to divide it by,49:01.0,49:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16962,7,2,T2 ,four,,49:04.0,49:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16963,7,2,T2 ,,you can just write it as a fraction,49:05.0,49:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16964,7,2,T2 ,,you don't have to actually do the thing,49:06.0,49:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16965,7,2,T2 ,yes I do,,49:09.0,49:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16966,7,2,T2 ,,okay if you want to,49:09.0,49:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16967,7,2,T2 ,,so then at the end it all just equals k equals four divided by sixty-two,49:11.0,49:20.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
16968,7,2,T2 ,,okay,49:21.0,49:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16969,7,2,T2 ,okay,,49:22.0,49:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16970,7,2,T2 ,,all right did you get it,49:22.0,49:37.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
16971,7,2,T2 ,almost,,49:37.0,49:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

16974,7,2,T2 ,lovely,,49:59.0,50:00.0,00:01.0,,,,UL,,
16975,7,2,T2 ,,alright okay,50:01.0,50:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
16976,7,2,T2 ,,did you figure out what it was is it fifteen point,50:02.0,50:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
16977,7,2,T2 ,fifteen point five,,50:07.0,50:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16978,7,2,T2 ,,all right so then fifteen point five equals k,50:08.0,50:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16979,7,2,T2 ,,what was that,50:15.0,50:15.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
16980,7,2,T2 ,,did you hear that,50:15.0,50:18.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,

16986,7,2,T2 ,,,50:27.0,53:39.0,03:12.0,,,,,,
16987,7,2,T2 ,,let me figure out what we have to do for this just so I can pause filler,50:28.0,50:31.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16988,7,2,T2 ,,okay,50:32.0,50:33.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
16989,7,2,T2 ,,yeah okay,50:35.0,50:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16990,7,2,T2 ,,I think I know (laughter),50:36.0,50:39.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
16991,7,2,T2 ,,how do I get,50:40.0,50:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16992,7,2,T2 ,well I think you have to subtract it,,50:44.0,50:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16993,7,2,T2 ,,no no no (laughter),50:48.0,50:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16994,7,2,T2 ,well then it's multiply or addition,,50:49.0,50:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16995,7,2,T2 ,,yeah how do we get the negative fourteen all alone,50:51.0,50:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
16996,7,2,T2 ,you have to subtract it byy,,50:58.0,51:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
16997,7,2,T2 ,,multiply multiply,51:00.0,51:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
16998,7,2,T2 ,whatever,,51:01.0,51:02.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
16999,7,2,T2 ,multiply by y,,51:03.0,51:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17000,7,2,T2 ,,so you're going to wait,51:04.0,51:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17001,7,2,T2 ,,oh that feels good to like take them off,51:08.0,51:10.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
17002,7,2,T2 ,,okay,51:11.0,51:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17003,7,2,T2 ,,that's the people at school would be like put their heads (inaudible),51:13.0,51:16.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
17004,7,2,T2 ,,okay so if we did pause filler negative fourteen over y times y,51:17.0,51:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17005,7,2,T2 ,,that's going to just equal negative fourteen,51:22.0,51:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17006,7,2,T2 ,,do you want to write that down,51:24.0,51:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17007,7,2,T2 ,,here I'll like write a little arrow,51:28.0,51:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17008,7,2,T2 ,,why is this computer so slow,51:34.0,51:36.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
17009,7,2,T2 ,,okay so then it's just going to be it's two hundred ten pause filler times y is going to equal negative fourteen,51:36.0,51:50.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
17010,7,2,T2 ,,do you get that,51:52.0,51:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17011,7,2,T2 ,yeah,,51:57.0,51:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17012,7,2,T2 ,,okay so now that we have two hundred ten times y equals fourteen,51:59.0,52:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17013,7,2,T2 ,,we just have to make y alone,52:05.0,52:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17014,7,2,T2 ,so then we have to do y plus y or subtraction,,52:08.0,52:13.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17015,7,2,T2 ,,division,52:14.0,52:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17016,7,2,T2 ,,we have to divide two hundred ten y divided by two hundred ten,52:14.0,52:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17017,7,2,T2 ,,because then it will leave y alone,52:18.0,52:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17018,7,2,T2 ,,do you get that,52:21.0,52:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17019,7,2,T2 ,,so oh my god you just disappeared,52:23.0,52:25.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
17020,7,2,T2 ,,oh there you are,52:27.0,52:28.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,

17022,7,2,T2 ,,like the screen went like blue like,52:29.0,52:31.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
17023,7,2,T2 ,,not blue,52:31.0,52:31.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
17024,7,2,T2 ,,but like it was just like a home screen,52:31.0,52:33.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
17025,7,2,T2 ,,and it was just like I was like what did I do okay pause filler,52:33.0,52:40.0,00:07.0,SV,,,,,
17026,7,2,T2 ,,so what's it going to do,52:40.0,52:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17027,7,2,T2 ,,it's two hundred ten y divided by two hundred ten,52:43.0,52:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17028,7,2,T2 ,,so that's just going to be y,52:49.0,52:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17029,7,2,T2 ,,and then what's going to happen to the negative fourteen,52:50.0,52:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17030,7,2,T2 ,is that the answer,,52:56.0,52:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17031,7,2,T2 ,,yeah,52:58.0,52:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17032,7,2,T2 ,okay (laughter),,53:00.0,53:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17033,7,2,T2 ,,so what's the full answer,53:01.0,53:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17034,7,2,T2 ,y equals negative fourteen,,53:04.0,53:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17035,7,2,T2 ,,over,53:06.0,53:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17036,7,2,T2 ,y I have no idea,,53:08.0,53:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17037,7,2,T2 ,,two hundred ten,53:11.0,53:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17038,7,2,T2 ,,because if we have to divide two hundred ten y pause filler by two hundred ten you also have to do that to the other side,53:13.0,53:21.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17039,7,2,T2 ,,because since we're trying to get y alone,53:21.0,53:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17040,7,2,T2 ,,so we had to divide two hundred ten to each side,53:23.0,53:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17041,7,2,T2 ,,so then the other side just became y,53:27.0,53:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17042,7,2,T2 ,,and the other side is now negative fourteen divided by two hundred ten,53:29.0,53:35.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17043,7,2,T2 ,,you got it,53:37.0,53:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17044,7,2,T2 ,,all right want to go to the next one,53:39.0,53:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17045,7,2,T2 ,,I think they might be coming,53:41.0,53:42.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
17046,7,2,T2 ,,yeah they're coming,53:42.0,53:42.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
17047,7,2,T2 ,,wait are they coming yeah,53:42.0,53:47.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,
17048,7,2,T2 ,,no okay pause filler,53:47.0,53:47.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
17049,7,2,T2 ,,let's go to the next one,53:48.0,53:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17050,7,2,T2 ,,I did it like the first time I,53:55.0,53:58.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,

17099,8,1,S1 ,yeah,,06:17.0,06:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17100,8,1,S1 ,the first tab,,06:33.0,06:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17101,8,1,S1 ,this one,,06:38.0,06:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17102,8,1,S1 ,yeah,,06:48.0,06:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17103,8,1,S1 ,all right so get back to one all right,,07:39.0,07:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17104,8,1,T1 ,,,07:41.0,22:51.0,15:10.0,,,,,,
17105,8,1,T1 ,,,07:41.0,08:00.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
17106,8,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm,07:45.0,07:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17107,8,1,T1 ,all right so can you just,,07:47.0,07:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17108,8,1,T1 ,pause filler I don't know,,07:49.0,07:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17109,8,1,T1 ,so what's the answer,,07:51.0,07:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17110,8,1,T1 ,,nineteen,07:53.0,07:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17111,8,1,T1 ,awesome okay so just (inaudible) work just adding that all right,,07:54.0,08:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17112,8,1,T1 ,,,08:00.0,09:00.0,01:00.0,,,,,,
17113,8,1,T1 ,so this base idea you can just,,08:00.0,08:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17114,8,1,T1 ,do you have any answer,,08:04.0,08:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17115,8,1,T1 ,,this one,08:07.0,08:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17116,8,1,T1 ,yeah,,08:12.0,08:12.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17117,8,1,T1 ,,pause filler seven,08:12.0,08:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17118,8,1,T1 ,okay so when we have a negative right here we want to the other side,,08:15.0,08:23.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17119,8,1,T1 ,we want to add it,,08:24.0,08:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17120,8,1,T1 ,,add it on both sides,08:26.0,08:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17121,8,1,T1 ,yeah and then sorry for my handwriting and so fifteen,,08:27.0,08:33.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17122,8,1,T1 ,you add that,,08:34.0,08:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17123,8,1,T1 ,and you got twenty-three equals k,,08:35.0,08:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17124,8,1,T1 ,all right does that makes sense,,08:40.0,08:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17125,8,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm,08:42.0,08:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17126,8,1,T1 ,awesome okay next question so can you try this again,,08:43.0,08:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17127,8,1,T1 ,,negative six,08:49.0,08:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17128,8,1,T1 ,awesome so you know subtraction cool,,08:52.0,09:00.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17129,8,1,T1 ,okay so here here's a good question,,09:00.0,09:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17130,8,1,T1 ,,,09:00.0,09:37.0,00:37.0,,,,,,
17131,8,1,T1 ,can you do this one for me,,09:03.0,09:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17132,8,1,T1 ,,pause filler minus fourteen,09:05.0,09:23.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
17133,8,1,T1 ,yeah,,09:23.0,09:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17134,8,1,T1 ,,five,09:23.0,09:37.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
17135,8,1,T1 ,awesome cool yeah this one is (inaudible) right here,,09:37.0,09:50.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
17136,8,1,T1 ,,,09:37.0,11:36.0,01:59.0,,,,,,
17137,8,1,T1 ,okay so here's a two separate equation,,09:50.0,10:14.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
17138,8,1,T1 ,,pause filler,10:13.0,10:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17139,8,1,T1 ,so you should do that,,10:14.0,10:24.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
17140,8,1,T1 ,so do you know how to do this right,,10:24.0,10:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17141,8,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm,10:27.0,10:35.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17142,8,1,T1 ,yeah so you're not really going to get a whole number,,10:28.0,10:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17143,8,1,T1 ,so just kind of tell me what fraction you got at the end was,,10:34.0,10:44.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
17144,8,1,T1 ,,pause filler I like this pen (inaudible),10:44.0,10:45.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
17145,8,1,T1 ,yeah okay so yeah so let's do it here,,10:45.0,11:00.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
17146,8,1,T1 ,so you add nine to both sides,,11:00.0,11:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17147,8,1,T1 ,and then so you have thirteen p equals fifty,,11:02.0,11:12.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
17148,8,1,T1 ,and you got thirteen pause filler end up with p equals fifty divided by thirteen,,11:12.0,11:22.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
17149,8,1,T1 ,and if you want to solve that out or just do that,,11:22.0,11:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17150,8,1,T1 ,you don't really have to questions like that,,11:26.0,11:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17151,8,1,T1 ,it's either you got a fraction,,11:30.0,11:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17152,8,1,T1 ,you should leave it like that,,11:33.0,11:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17153,8,1,T1 ,or put it here okay,,11:34.0,11:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17154,8,1,T1 ,so next question can you do this please,,11:36.0,11:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17155,8,1,T1 ,,,11:36.0,12:45.0,01:09.0,,,,,,
17156,8,1,T1 ,someone's watching us here,mm-hmm,11:38.0,11:44.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17157,8,1,T1 ,,yeah let's see oh something,11:44.0,11:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17158,8,1,T1 ,what,,11:49.0,11:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17159,8,1,T1 ,,so something's messing up with this pen,11:50.0,11:52.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
17160,8,1,T1 ,aw,,11:53.0,11:53.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
17161,8,1,T1 ,,just clicking new tabs and stuff,11:53.0,12:04.0,00:11.0,,SV,,,,
17162,8,1,T1 ,oh pause filler so try to go back to the one you are pause filler in the first one,,12:04.0,12:36.0,00:32.0,,,,,,
17163,8,1,T1 ,,it's four,12:36.0,12:44.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17164,8,1,T1 ,awesome okay onto the next question okay so let's work on this,,12:45.0,12:57.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
17165,8,1,T1 ,,,12:45.0,17:58.0,05:13.0,,,,,,
17166,8,1,T1 ,seven equals sixteen,,12:57.0,13:21.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
17167,8,1,T1 ,,okay this is another one where you're not going to get a whole number,13:24.0,14:07.0,00:43.0,,,,,,
17168,8,1,T1 ,mm-hmm okay so you pause filler what you're doing it's the same it's again probably pretty much the same thing as the one we did earlier it's just pause filler,,14:07.0,14:16.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
17169,8,1,T1 ,,but it works,14:16.0,14:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17170,8,1,T1 ,yeah so really it doesn't matter where the k ends,,14:19.0,14:25.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17171,8,1,T1 ,it just matters where you pause filler,,14:25.0,14:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17172,8,1,T1 ,I mean you just want to have the k by itself on one side,,14:29.0,14:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17173,8,1,T1 ,and so what you want to try to do is you want to get,,14:34.0,14:43.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
17174,8,1,T1 ,oops sorry you want to get this,,14:43.0,14:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17175,8,1,T1 ,oops you want to get this over here,,14:45.0,14:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17176,8,1,T1 ,and you want to get that fifteen over here,,14:51.0,14:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17177,8,1,T1 ,and so basically when you're working with these you want to pause filler you pause filler,,14:56.0,14:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17178,8,1,T1 ,it's kind of like an inverse operations inverse order of operations type of thing,,14:59.0,15:08.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
17179,8,1,T1 ,so you want to do addition or subtraction first and then multiplication or division,,15:08.0,15:14.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17180,8,1,T1 ,so you're going to start with getting the twenty-two to the other side and then dividing by fifteen,,15:15.0,15:36.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
17181,8,1,T1 ,,(inaudible) should just give us the (inaudible),15:37.0,15:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17182,8,1,T1 ,yeah or maybe it's like some kind of test or something,,15:39.0,15:47.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17183,8,1,T1 ,okay so here we have a negative number here,,15:47.0,15:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17184,8,1,T1 ,so you want to add it,,15:52.0,15:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17185,8,1,T1 ,and then you have a multiplication,,15:54.0,15:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17186,8,1,T1 ,you want to give so multiply,,15:56.0,15:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17187,8,1,T1 ,so you want to divide it,,15:59.0,16:06.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17188,8,1,T1 ,and so this is first,,16:07.0,16:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17189,8,1,T1 ,and then this is second,,16:12.0,16:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17190,8,1,T1 ,,well it is making me mad,16:13.0,16:43.0,00:30.0,,SV,,,,SD
17191,8,1,T1 ,yeah okay so let's do this together,,16:43.0,16:52.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
17192,8,1,T1 ,so we have twenty-two and some negative,,16:52.0,16:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17193,8,1,T1 ,so we want to add twenty-two to both sides so,,16:55.0,17:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17194,8,1,T1 ,and that gets rid of this twenty-two,,17:01.0,17:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17195,8,1,T1 ,and that makes this sixty-two courtesy of this fifteen right here,,17:04.0,17:12.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17196,8,1,T1 ,and since it's multiplied b k,,17:13.0,17:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17197,8,1,T1 ,you want to divide it,,17:15.0,17:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17198,8,1,T1 ,so you divide sixty-two by fifteen,,17:17.0,17:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17199,8,1,T1 ,and that equals k,,17:24.0,17:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17200,8,1,T1 ,,what then k equals pause filler,17:27.0,17:36.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
17201,8,1,T1 ,k equals sixty-two,,17:36.0,17:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17202,8,1,T1 ,,k equals sixty-two sixty-two divided by five is like four,17:38.0,17:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17203,8,1,T1 ,it's divided by fifteen,,17:45.0,17:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17204,8,1,T1 ,and it's about four yeah,,17:49.0,17:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17205,8,1,T1 ,so that's good,,17:51.0,17:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17206,8,1,T1 ,it's four and two fifteens okay so next question,,17:52.0,17:59.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17207,8,1,T1 ,,,17:58.0,18:17.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
17208,8,1,T1 ,okay so this one is also pretty easy,,18:01.0,18:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17209,8,1,T1 ,so that's one of the easier ones,,18:05.0,18:14.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
17210,8,1,T1 ,,there's three,18:14.0,18:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17211,8,1,T1 ,what,,18:16.0,18:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17212,8,1,T1 ,,three,18:16.0,18:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17213,8,1,T1 ,yeah awesome great next question okay that is,,18:17.0,18:31.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
17214,8,1,T1 ,,,18:17.0,18:32.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
17215,8,1,T1 ,,three again,18:31.0,18:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17216,8,1,T1 ,three yeah well great okay pause filler question is okay,,18:32.0,18:46.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
17217,8,1,T1 ,,,18:33.0,21:30.0,02:57.0,,,,,,
17218,8,1,T1 ,so you have k on both sides,,18:48.0,18:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17219,8,1,T1 ,so you want to get both of the Ks just to one side,,18:51.0,18:56.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17220,8,1,T1 ,and since you have more Ks over here,,18:56.0,18:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17221,8,1,T1 ,you want to get rid of this k,,18:59.0,19:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17222,8,1,T1 ,so since if there's no positive or negative sign next to it,,19:02.0,19:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17223,8,1,T1 ,that means it's positive,,19:06.0,19:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17224,8,1,T1 ,so you would subtract k from both sides,,19:10.0,19:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17225,8,1,T1 ,and so you would have negative ten equals seven k minus sixty-eight,,19:14.0,19:21.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17226,8,1,T1 ,and then can you work out from there,,19:22.0,19:41.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
17227,8,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm like add something,19:41.0,19:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17228,8,1,T1 ,okay so let's close it,,19:44.0,19:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17229,8,1,T1 ,so this is negative,,19:46.0,19:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17230,8,1,T1 ,we want to add it to both sides,,19:50.0,19:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17231,8,1,T1 ,so since this is,,19:52.0,19:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17232,8,1,T1 ,so you add sixty-eight to both sides,,19:54.0,19:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17233,8,1,T1 ,and so you have negative ten on this side,,19:57.0,20:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17234,8,1,T1 ,so that's basically saying sixty-eight plus negative ten is also right,,20:00.0,20:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17235,8,1,T1 ,yeah sixty-eight minus ten is negative ten plus sixty-eight,,20:06.0,20:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17236,8,1,T1 ,so you have sixty-eight minus ten equals seven k,,20:12.0,20:22.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
17237,8,1,T1 ,and so you have fifty-eight equals seven k,,20:23.0,20:30.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17238,8,1,T1 ,so can you do that,,20:31.0,20:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17239,8,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm so fifty-eight minus seven k,20:35.0,20:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17240,8,1,T1 ,fifty-eight equals seven k,,20:38.0,20:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17241,8,1,T1 ,so my handwriting is (inaudible),,20:40.0,20:50.0,00:10.0,SV,,,,,
17242,8,1,T1 ,,four something oh that equals,20:50.0,21:18.0,00:28.0,,,,,,
17243,8,1,T1 ,,I think it's like eight around eight,21:20.0,21:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17244,8,1,T1 ,yup yeah that's exactly eight awesome,,21:23.0,21:30.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17245,8,1,T1 ,so that is ten questions,,21:31.0,21:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17246,8,1,T1 ,so there we go awesome,,21:36.0,21:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17247,8,1,T1 ,so now we kind of just wait,,21:44.0,21:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17248,8,1,T1 ,,do you have another tab open as Scribbler over,21:47.0,21:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17249,8,1,T1 ,yeah,,21:53.0,21:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17250,8,1,T1 ,,I think that one we're supposed to do next,21:53.0,21:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17251,8,1,T1 ,all right I don't know,,21:58.0,22:03.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17252,8,1,T1 ,they just told me to go to eleven and then stop,,22:03.0,22:31.0,00:28.0,,,,,,

17254,8,1,T1 ,or maybe we're supposed to,,22:39.0,22:41.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
17255,8,1,T1 ,actually I think we're supposed to come out and actually get them,,22:42.0,22:50.0,00:08.0,SV,,,,,
17256,8,1,T1 ,,okay,22:50.0,22:50.0,00:00.0,,SV,,,,
17257,8,1,T1 ,yes,,23:55.0,23:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17258,8,1,T1 ,all right so we have another ten questions to do,,24:15.0,24:22.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17259,8,1,T1 ,,,24:18.0,27:25.0,03:07.0,,,,,,
17260,8,1,T1 ,,yeah I want to switch to this computer,24:22.0,24:24.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
17261,8,1,T1 ,yeah okay,,24:26.0,24:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17262,8,1,T1 ,,oh one second I don't know why we're kind of through this,24:29.0,25:58.0,01:29.0,,SV,,,,
17263,8,1,T1 ,,,25:58.0,27:25.0,01:27.0,,,,,,
17264,8,1,T1 ,all right so do you want to start working on this,,25:58.0,26:07.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
17265,8,1,T1 ,so let's just pause filler,,26:08.0,26:16.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17266,8,1,T1 ,we should remember what our signs are,,26:17.0,26:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17267,8,1,T1 ,this is the negative,,26:20.0,26:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17268,8,1,T1 ,this is the negative,,26:21.0,26:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17269,8,1,T1 ,this is the positive,,26:23.0,26:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17270,8,1,T1 ,that's a positive,,26:24.0,26:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17271,8,1,T1 ,so you can try to do that oh,,26:25.0,26:43.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
17272,8,1,T1 ,,oh my gosh this mouse (inaudible),26:44.0,26:45.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
17273,8,1,T1 ,okay wait don't press the wrong button,,26:45.0,26:49.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
17274,8,1,T1 ,let's go there there okay,,26:50.0,26:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17275,8,1,T1 ,,I don't know none of this,26:58.0,27:04.0,00:06.0,,,,,,SD
17276,8,1,T1 ,okay so here so you want to get the r on just one side,,27:04.0,27:12.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17277,8,1,T1 ,so since you have less r on here,,27:12.0,27:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17278,8,1,T1 ,you just have one r,,27:15.0,27:15.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17279,8,1,T1 ,so you subtract r from this side,,27:15.0,27:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17280,8,1,T1 ,and subtract r from that side,,27:19.0,27:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17281,8,1,T1 ,and you have negative thirty-three equals r,,27:20.0,27:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17282,8,1,T1 ,because you subtract to one,,27:25.0,27:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

17318,8,1,T2 ,,,36:06.0,36:53.0,00:47.0,,,,,,
17319,8,1,T2 ,okay so you have y,,36:06.0,36:33.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
17320,8,1,T2 ,subtract it,,36:33.0,36:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17321,8,1,T2 ,or subtract it to twenty-two equals y,,36:35.0,36:41.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17322,8,1,T2 ,one equals three over five,,36:41.0,36:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17323,8,1,T2 ,okay so you have y equals negative five,,36:46.0,36:52.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17324,8,1,T2 ,okay oops okay oh that's going okay so let's see,,36:53.0,37:11.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
17325,8,1,T2 ,,,36:53.0,37:14.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
17326,8,1,T2 ,oh no this is,,37:11.0,37:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17327,8,1,T2 ,okay okay so subtract okay equals,,37:12.0,37:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17328,8,1,T2 ,so k equals twenty-five okay yup,,37:14.0,37:22.0,00:08.0,,,,,,

17459,8,2,S1 ,,so you'll be tutoring this time,06:18.0,06:33.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
17460,8,2,S1 ,,so you'll be in the green text,06:33.0,06:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17461,8,2,S1 ,,and just be like last time,06:35.0,06:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17462,8,2,S1 ,okay,,06:36.0,06:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17463,8,2,S1 ,,so again these are kind of the logic behind,06:37.0,06:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17464,8,2,S1 ,,but not the same numbers,06:41.0,06:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17465,8,2,S1 ,okay oh we've got one to ten again,,06:44.0,06:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17466,8,2,S1 ,,yeah so how many do we have this time,06:48.0,06:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17467,8,2,S1 ,,all right okay,06:59.0,07:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17468,8,2,T1 ,,,07:06.0,25:09.0,18:03.0,,,,,,
17469,8,2,T1 ,,,07:09.0,08:42.0,01:33.0,,,,,,
17470,8,2,T1 ,,awesome so can we start,07:09.0,07:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17471,8,2,T1 ,,okay do you know how to do this,07:13.0,07:20.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17472,8,2,T1 ,pause filler I think so,,07:20.0,07:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17473,8,2,T1 ,,okay,07:35.0,07:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17474,8,2,T1 ,,I don't think you got a whole number,07:36.0,07:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17475,8,2,T1 ,,so just like whatever the fraction is at the end,07:37.0,07:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17476,8,2,T1 ,wouldn't it be like four or something,,07:41.0,07:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17477,8,2,T1 ,,oh I think so because you have so when we divide it by three,07:44.0,07:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17478,8,2,T1 ,,it sounds I can't right on these,07:49.0,07:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17479,8,2,T1 ,,pause filler you actually are multiplying it by seven over three,07:53.0,07:59.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17480,8,2,T1 ,,so you have,07:59.0,08:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17481,8,2,T1 ,,I should get rid of this,08:01.0,08:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17482,8,2,T1 ,,pause filler forty times seven over three,08:05.0,08:11.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17483,8,2,T1 ,,equals x,08:13.0,08:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17484,8,2,T1 ,,so x equals two hundred,08:15.0,08:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17485,8,2,T1 ,so what it would be ninety-three,,08:21.0,08:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17486,8,2,T1 ,,it would be over three,08:23.0,08:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17487,8,2,T1 ,,pause filler it doesn't I don't think it goes into three equally,08:25.0,08:32.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17488,8,2,T1 ,,so you just have this is the answer,08:32.0,08:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17489,8,2,T1 ,two eighty,,08:37.0,08:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17490,8,2,T1 ,,two eighty over three,08:38.0,08:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17491,8,2,T1 ,perfect pause filler I get it now,,08:40.0,08:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17492,8,2,T1 ,,yeah okay so next pause filler same idea,08:42.0,08:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17493,8,2,T1 ,,,08:42.0,09:23.0,00:41.0,,,,,,
17494,8,2,T1 ,yes,,08:45.0,08:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17495,8,2,T1 ,,so the next one would be,08:47.0,09:01.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
17496,8,2,T1 ,right,,09:19.0,09:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17497,8,2,T1 ,,yup perfect,09:20.0,09:21.0,00:01.0,,,UL,,,
17498,8,2,T1 ,,awesome,09:22.0,09:23.0,00:01.0,,,UL,,,
17499,8,2,T1 ,,let's go,09:23.0,09:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17500,8,2,T1 ,,pause filler so this one is two-step,09:23.0,09:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17501,8,2,T1 ,,,09:23.0,11:23.0,02:00.0,,,,,,
17502,8,2,T1 ,,it's pretty simple,09:26.0,09:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17503,8,2,T1 ,so it would be two times eighteen,,09:32.0,09:42.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
17504,8,2,T1 ,,no,09:42.0,09:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17505,8,2,T1 ,,so what you do is you add eighteen to both sides to get rid of it first,09:43.0,09:49.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17506,8,2,T1 ,,so you have seventy on this side and negative two thirds y,09:50.0,09:59.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
17507,8,2,T1 ,,and then you just do the same thing except this part is negative,09:59.0,10:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17508,8,2,T1 ,this would be one forty negative one forty,,10:05.0,10:22.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
17509,8,2,T1 ,,pause filler yes wait no,10:24.0,10:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17510,8,2,T1 ,it's positive,,10:25.0,10:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17511,8,2,T1 ,,oh two ten,10:27.0,10:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17512,8,2,T1 ,so (inaudible),,10:30.0,10:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17513,8,2,T1 ,,no no no because you do pause filler because when you divide this you have to multiply it by the reciprocal or three over two,10:30.0,10:40.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
17514,8,2,T1 ,,so it's seventy times three divided by two,10:41.0,10:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17515,8,2,T1 ,,so that's two hundred ten divided by two,10:45.0,10:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17516,8,2,T1 ,twenty-two,,10:49.0,10:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17517,8,2,T1 ,,so you got in the end one hundred five,10:55.0,11:08.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
17518,8,2,T1 ,,yeah times don't mind what's right there but okay,11:08.0,11:19.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
17519,8,2,T1 ,,,11:23.0,13:12.0,01:49.0,,,,,,
17520,8,2,T1 ,,okay,11:23.0,11:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17521,8,2,T1 ,thirteen oh,,11:24.0,11:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17522,8,2,T1 ,so do we still add thirteen to both sides,,11:24.0,11:29.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17523,8,2,T1 ,,no,11:29.0,11:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17524,8,2,T1 ,,since this is positive you subtract thirteen to both sides,11:29.0,11:36.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17525,8,2,T1 ,,because you want to get rid of this,11:39.0,12:04.0,00:25.0,,,,,,
17526,8,2,T1 ,,it's thirty-one,12:05.0,12:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17527,8,2,T1 ,is it,,12:10.0,12:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17528,8,2,T1 ,,yeah,12:11.0,12:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17529,8,2,T1 ,oh,,12:13.0,12:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17530,8,2,T1 ,,okay seven times that equals,12:18.0,12:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17531,8,2,T1 ,,one half x,12:23.0,12:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17532,8,2,T1 ,,and then this is as simple as just x equals two one times thirty-one,12:26.0,12:42.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
17533,8,2,T1 ,,so what does x equal,12:42.0,12:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17534,8,2,T1 ,x equal,,12:46.0,12:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17535,8,2,T1 ,okay x equals,,12:50.0,12:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17536,8,2,T1 ,pause filler is that multiply,,12:53.0,12:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17537,8,2,T1 ,,yeah it's multiply sorry,12:55.0,12:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17538,8,2,T1 ,sixty-two,,13:02.0,13:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17539,8,2,T1 ,,yeah,13:03.0,13:03.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17540,8,2,T1 ,x equals,,13:05.0,13:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17541,8,2,T1 ,,awesome,13:11.0,13:12.0,00:01.0,,,UL,,,
17542,8,2,T1 ,they just like to come before,,13:12.0,13:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17543,8,2,T1 ,,,13:12.0,15:30.0,02:18.0,,,,,,
17544,8,2,T1 ,,yeah and that's basically the same idea,13:17.0,13:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17545,8,2,T1 ,,since this is negative you are adding this time,13:23.0,13:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17546,8,2,T1 ,pause filler six time thirty-one,,13:29.0,13:53.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
17547,8,2,T1 ,wow,,13:55.0,13:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17548,8,2,T1 ,forty-seven,,13:56.0,13:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17549,8,2,T1 ,,yeah and this one kind of sucks because you have to multiply that by,13:58.0,14:03.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17550,8,2,T1 ,nineteen,,14:04.0,14:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17551,8,2,T1 ,so this is nineteen over six,,14:05.0,14:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17552,8,2,T1 ,,what,14:08.0,14:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17553,8,2,T1 ,is it nineteen over six,,14:10.0,14:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17554,8,2,T1 ,,no because when you're adding it this is not affected by that,14:12.0,14:18.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17555,8,2,T1 ,,so when you add sixteen here it only affects that,14:19.0,14:27.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17556,8,2,T1 ,,so it only just gets rid of that,14:27.0,14:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17557,8,2,T1 ,,so you have forty-seven equals three six time x,14:29.0,14:36.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17558,8,2,T1 ,so forty-six times three over forty-seven times three,,14:39.0,14:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17559,8,2,T1 ,,it's forty-seven times six because you're dividing by three,14:44.0,14:51.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17560,8,2,T1 ,,six plus means you're multiplying by six thirds,14:51.0,14:59.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17561,8,2,T1 ,yeah and then that is all over three,,15:07.0,15:14.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17562,8,2,T1 ,six,,15:15.0,15:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17563,8,2,T1 ,,three,15:17.0,15:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17564,8,2,T1 ,,because you have times yeah,15:17.0,15:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17565,8,2,T1 ,,and that should go in equally yeah,15:23.0,15:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17566,8,2,T1 ,,,15:30.0,17:43.0,02:13.0,,,,,,
17567,8,2,T1 ,that's the (inaudible) one,,15:30.0,15:37.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17568,8,2,T1 ,,yeah this one shouldn't be too hard,15:37.0,15:44.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17569,8,2,T1 ,,let's see,15:45.0,15:45.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17570,8,2,T1 ,,pause filler since this is positive we're going to subtract that,15:46.0,15:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17571,8,2,T1 ,,and we're going to get a negative answer because that's negative,15:49.0,15:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17572,8,2,T1 ,,so you want to do this part,15:54.0,15:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17573,8,2,T1 ,ninety-seven minus eighteen,,15:56.0,15:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17574,8,2,T1 ,,minus forty-eight,15:59.0,16:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17575,8,2,T1 ,oh it's minus forty-eight,,16:00.0,16:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17576,8,2,T1 ,,yeah,16:02.0,16:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17577,8,2,T1 ,so forty-five oh,,16:05.0,16:25.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
17578,8,2,T1 ,,what okay okay,16:25.0,16:35.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
17579,8,2,T1 ,you know it would be forty-nine because it's forty-nine time twelve,,16:37.0,16:53.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
17580,8,2,T1 ,,so it would be forty-nine times five over twelve,16:53.0,16:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17581,8,2,T1 ,,and it's negative,16:57.0,16:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17582,8,2,T1 ,,so forty-nine times five over twelve equals y,16:58.0,17:12.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
17583,8,2,T1 ,,and then you're just going to this is here,17:14.0,17:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17584,8,2,T1 ,this is forty-five,,17:19.0,17:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17585,8,2,T1 ,,over so it's two forty-five all over twelve,17:23.0,17:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17586,8,2,T1 ,,that doesn't go any equally,17:28.0,17:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17587,8,2,T1 ,,so that's just there,17:29.0,17:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17588,8,2,T1 ,,yeah that's the answer to that,17:33.0,17:38.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17589,8,2,T1 ,do we stop answering,,17:39.0,17:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17590,8,2,T1 ,,pause filler I think if we do it will tell us,17:40.0,17:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17591,8,2,T1 ,,,17:43.0,20:08.0,02:25.0,,,,,,
17592,8,2,T1 ,,I don't like this one okay so,17:44.0,17:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17593,8,2,T1 ,,so I'm going to rewrite this,17:47.0,17:56.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
17594,8,2,T1 ,,you have negative six,17:56.0,17:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17595,8,2,T1 ,,just make eleven make a little more sense,17:58.0,18:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17596,8,2,T1 ,,minus sixty-one equals twenty-five plus seven over seven y because seven over seven equals one,18:01.0,18:15.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
17597,8,2,T1 ,,so that makes it easier to do stuff between these two,18:15.0,18:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17598,8,2,T1 ,this is thirty-six,,18:29.0,18:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17599,8,2,T1 ,,yeah okay so what you want to do is you want to get the twenty-five over here,18:32.0,18:40.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17600,8,2,T1 ,,and this over here,18:42.0,18:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17601,8,2,T1 ,,for either way but,18:48.0,18:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17602,8,2,T1 ,,so how you would so that is subtract twenty-five from both sides,18:54.0,19:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17603,8,2,T1 ,,you have negative six seven y minus,19:00.0,19:08.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17604,8,2,T1 ,,what's that eighty-six equals y,19:09.0,19:17.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17605,8,2,T1 ,,and then you can add six sevenths y to both sides,19:18.0,19:26.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17606,8,2,T1 ,,and so you have negative eighty-six equals,19:27.0,19:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17607,8,2,T1 ,,and since this is seven over seven you get,19:33.0,19:38.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17608,8,2,T1 ,,pause filler thirteen over seven y because that's just adding the six and the seven,19:40.0,19:47.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
17609,8,2,T1 ,,and you keep the seven on the bottom,19:47.0,19:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17610,8,2,T1 ,,and then you do the same thing we've been doing with all of them,19:49.0,19:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17611,8,2,T1 ,,you just multiply negative eighty-six by seven divided by thirteen,19:52.0,19:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17612,8,2,T1 ,divided by thirteen,,20:00.0,20:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17613,8,2,T1 ,,yeah,20:02.0,20:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17614,8,2,T1 ,it's six,,20:05.0,20:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17615,8,2,T1 ,,awesome,20:07.0,20:08.0,00:01.0,,,UL,,,
17616,8,2,T1 ,,oh there we go okay so,20:19.0,20:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17617,8,2,T1 ,,,20:23.0,25:08.0,04:45.0,,,,,,
17618,8,2,T1 ,,okay this is yeah okay,20:23.0,20:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17619,8,2,T1 ,,so let's see,20:26.0,20:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17620,8,2,T1 ,,so this is eleven over one,20:33.0,20:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17621,8,2,T1 ,,just to make that that's also thirty-three over three if you want to have it for this three over here,20:37.0,21:03.0,00:26.0,,,,,,
17622,8,2,T1 ,what in the world so three seventeen on both sides,,21:13.0,21:28.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
17623,8,2,T1 ,,okay so you have on this side negative one hundred minus eleven x equals ten over three x,21:31.0,21:50.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
17624,8,2,T1 ,,okay so you can't do that because one hundred doesn't have I'm sorry one hundred doesn't have an x connected to it,22:02.0,22:17.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
17625,8,2,T1 ,,so you want to get this over that side,22:17.0,22:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17626,8,2,T1 ,,so you would add put that to both sides,22:24.0,22:29.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
17627,8,2,T1 ,,and remember this eleven is also thirty-three over three,22:29.0,22:42.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
17628,8,2,T1 ,,so you can add it to that,22:42.0,22:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17629,8,2,T1 ,this it's very confusing,,22:49.0,22:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17630,8,2,T1 ,,yeah ten over three x plus,22:52.0,23:09.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
17631,8,2,T1 ,you said you go to (inaudible) right,,23:11.0,23:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17632,8,2,T1 ,,yeah,23:12.0,23:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17633,8,2,T1 ,did you all have a carwash the last Sunday I mean the last Saturday,,23:13.0,23:19.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17634,8,2,T1 ,,did we,23:21.0,23:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17635,8,2,T1 ,they said a sophomore carwashed,,23:21.0,23:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17636,8,2,T1 ,,I have no idea,23:24.0,23:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17637,8,2,T1 ,,x and then that's a plus,23:26.0,23:40.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
17638,8,2,T1 ,this time would face,,23:40.0,23:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17639,8,2,T1 ,,oh yeah huh thirty-three over three x,23:43.0,23:49.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17640,8,2,T1 ,,so can we do that,23:49.0,23:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17641,8,2,T1 ,thirty-three times x thirty-three times,,23:52.0,23:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17642,8,2,T1 ,,that's ten over three x plus thirty-three over three x,23:55.0,23:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17643,8,2,T1 ,three goes into ten three times,,24:02.0,24:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17644,8,2,T1 ,,no it's just plus,24:06.0,24:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17645,8,2,T1 ,,so you just get forty-three over three x,24:09.0,24:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
17646,8,2,T1 ,that's the answer,,24:14.0,24:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17647,8,2,T1 ,,and also you have negative one hundred equals forty-three over three x,24:15.0,24:28.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
17648,8,2,T1 ,,and then you multiply it at this I mean you divide this by forty-three over three,24:30.0,24:41.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
17649,8,2,T1 ,,and you have negative one hundred,24:41.0,24:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17650,8,2,T1 ,,and that's negative one hundred I promise,24:44.0,24:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17651,8,2,T1 ,,oh Jesus,24:47.0,24:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17652,8,2,T1 ,,is it possible to write with these,24:49.0,24:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17653,8,2,T1 ,,so one hundred times that's times three over,24:53.0,25:04.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
17654,8,2,T1 ,they're coming to you right now,,25:05.0,25:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17655,8,2,T1 ,,okay,25:06.0,25:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17656,8,2,T1 ,,time,25:10.0,25:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17657,8,2,T1 ,,okay,25:12.0,25:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17658,8,2,T1 ,,okay,25:34.0,25:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
17659,8,2,T1 ,,pause filler to the other room,25:38.0,25:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17660,8,2,T1 ,,I'm just really bad at drawings,25:55.0,25:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17661,8,2,S2 ,,,26:29.0,26:37.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
17662,8,2,S2 ,,got the Skittles again,26:29.0,26:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
17663,8,2,S2 ,just like the last time,,26:33.0,26:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
17664,8,2,S2 ,is there that pause filler three,,26:45.0,26:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
17665,8,2,S2 ,,,26:57.0,32:05.0,05:08.0,,,,,,
17666,8,2,S2 ,this is better than the last time,,26:59.0,27:05.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
17667,8,2,S2 ,,yeah,27:06.0,27:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

18096,9,1,T1 ,oh you would just minus,,08:57.0,08:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18097,9,1,T1 ,yeah you just minus fifteen,,09:00.0,09:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18098,9,1,T1 ,from both sides because then you end up with something equals p,,09:01.0,09:06.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18099,9,1,T1 ,,okay,09:08.0,09:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18100,9,1,T1 ,like,,09:08.0,09:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18101,9,1,T1 ,I believe so,,09:09.0,09:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18102,9,1,T1 ,so fifteen minus fifteen,,09:14.0,09:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18103,9,1,T1 ,so then it would be negative eight minus fifteen,,09:19.0,09:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18104,9,1,T1 ,hold on,,09:21.0,09:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

18108,9,1,T1 ,,pause filler what if you did like negative eight minus like take the negative,09:39.0,09:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18109,9,1,T1 ,minus positive fifteen,,09:43.0,09:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18110,9,1,T1 ,,or like what if you did like you added eight to both sides,09:46.0,09:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18111,9,1,T1 ,,would that,09:52.0,09:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18112,9,1,T1 ,it would be,,09:53.0,09:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18113,9,1,T1 ,and it would be,,10:04.0,10:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18114,9,1,T1 ,,twenty-three,10:07.0,10:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18115,9,1,T1 ,twenty-three equals p,,10:09.0,10:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18116,9,1,T1 ,,okay all right we got it,10:12.0,10:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18117,9,1,T1 ,somewhat,,10:16.0,10:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18118,9,1,T1 ,,,10:19.0,12:28.0,02:09.0,,,,,,
18119,9,1,T1 ,I think this one you would do the same thing I believe,,10:20.0,10:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18120,9,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm yeah with the like subtracting negative eleven from both sides,10:26.0,10:31.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18121,9,1,T1 ,that is positive,,10:31.0,10:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18122,9,1,T1 ,,like did you subtract it to like to cancel it out,10:32.0,10:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18123,9,1,T1 ,mm-hmm okay,,10:38.0,10:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18124,9,1,T1 ,,what do you mean like this,10:40.0,10:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18125,9,1,T1 ,yeah,,10:42.0,10:42.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18126,9,1,T1 ,,yeah,10:43.0,10:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18127,9,1,T1 ,yeah so like top on it,,10:44.0,10:52.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
18128,9,1,T1 ,so seventeen minus eleven equals k,,10:57.0,11:03.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18129,9,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm which is pause filler,11:04.0,11:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18130,9,1,T1 ,six I believe right,,11:05.0,11:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18131,9,1,T1 ,,pause filler maybe yes I think so,11:11.0,11:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

18157,9,1,T1 ,,,12:28.0,13:55.0,01:27.0,,,,,,
18158,9,1,T1 ,so they will come out x equals,,12:31.0,12:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18159,9,1,T1 ,pause filler what's forty-four divided by two hundred and twenty,,12:40.0,12:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18160,9,1,T1 ,,well,12:47.0,12:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18161,9,1,T1 ,,yeah forty-four goes in at twenty-two two times right,12:47.0,12:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18162,9,1,T1 ,,no wait,12:55.0,12:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18163,9,1,T1 ,oh man you (inaudible) two yeah and then,,12:57.0,13:01.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18164,9,1,T1 ,,all right no twenty-two goes in at forty-four two times,13:01.0,13:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18165,9,1,T1 ,,pause filler forty-four doesn't go on twenty-two so,13:04.0,13:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18166,9,1,T1 ,probably (inaudible) number,,13:07.0,13:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18167,9,1,T1 ,,it's going the two hundred and twenty-two,13:08.0,13:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18168,9,1,T1 ,,I don't know what that is pause filler,13:11.0,13:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18169,9,1,T1 ,,I have no idea,13:14.0,13:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18170,9,1,T1 ,,there's no calculator obviously,13:18.0,13:20.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
18171,9,1,T1 ,well forty-four times,,13:20.0,13:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18172,9,1,T1 ,oh Jesus,,13:25.0,13:26.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
18173,9,1,T1 ,what's nine times four,,13:27.0,13:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18174,9,1,T1 ,,nine times four is thirty-two thirty-one I don't know if thirty-one thirty-two,13:31.0,13:36.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18175,9,1,T1 ,,is it thirty-two,13:36.0,13:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18176,9,1,T1 ,two,,13:38.0,13:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18177,9,1,T1 ,,yeah so two,13:38.0,13:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18178,9,1,T1 ,yeah it would be six,,13:39.0,13:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18179,9,1,T1 ,well (inaudible),,13:45.0,13:45.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18180,9,1,T1 ,so then,,13:45.0,13:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18181,9,1,T1 ,(inaudible) five,,13:53.0,13:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18182,9,1,T1 ,,okay yeah,13:53.0,13:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18183,9,1,T1 ,,,13:55.0,15:51.0,01:56.0,,,,,,
18184,9,1,T1 ,pause filler okay,,13:55.0,13:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18185,9,1,T1 ,so,,13:57.0,13:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18186,9,1,T1 ,I don't know,,13:57.0,14:06.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
18187,9,1,T1 ,I think we add thirteen,,14:06.0,14:17.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
18188,9,1,T1 ,and below you would add nine I believe,,14:19.0,14:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18189,9,1,T1 ,,I think so yeah,14:22.0,14:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18190,9,1,T1 ,forty-one,,14:35.0,14:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18191,9,1,T1 ,and it would be two thirty-two right,,14:39.0,14:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18192,9,1,T1 ,,forty-one plus nine is that fifty,14:42.0,14:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18193,9,1,T1 ,,and one is ten,14:45.0,14:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18194,9,1,T1 ,,fifty yeah,14:47.0,14:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18195,9,1,T1 ,,pause filler,14:53.0,14:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18196,9,1,T1 ,what is this,pause filler,14:55.0,14:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18197,9,1,T1 ,equals something,,14:55.0,14:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18198,9,1,T1 ,,yeah just like divide it by three,14:57.0,14:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18199,9,1,T1 ,,and then you'll get the answer,14:59.0,15:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18200,9,1,T1 ,,and that's it,15:00.0,15:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18201,9,1,T1 ,oh thirteen wait what,,15:02.0,15:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18202,9,1,T1 ,,because pause filler there's a thirteen p,15:05.0,15:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18203,9,1,T1 ,,so then you want to get rid of that thirteen,15:08.0,15:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18204,9,1,T1 ,,so it's just p,15:10.0,15:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18205,9,1,T1 ,,so you just divide it by thirteen on both sides,15:11.0,15:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18206,9,1,T1 ,,and then you'll get p,15:14.0,15:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18207,9,1,T1 ,,but I don't know what thirteen divided by fifty or whatever it is,15:15.0,15:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18208,9,1,T1 ,,some sort of a number,15:18.0,15:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18209,9,1,T1 ,pause filler or maybe is three,,15:21.0,15:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18210,9,1,T1 ,sorry,,15:27.0,15:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18211,9,1,T1 ,,it's okay,15:27.0,15:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18212,9,1,T1 ,and then maybe not,,15:30.0,15:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18213,9,1,T1 ,five,,15:34.0,15:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18214,9,1,T1 ,,and then I don't know,15:36.0,15:45.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
18215,9,1,T1 ,,no whatever fifty divided by thirteen is,15:46.0,15:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18216,9,1,T1 ,I'll just skip it,,15:50.0,15:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18217,9,1,T1 ,,,15:52.0,16:29.0,00:37.0,,,,,,
18218,9,1,T1 ,there this is easy,,15:52.0,15:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18219,9,1,T1 ,minus ten right,,15:58.0,15:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18220,9,1,T1 ,,yeah,16:00.0,16:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18221,9,1,T1 ,a hundred percent sure,,16:03.0,16:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18222,9,1,T1 ,,pause filler six x minus twenty-four is four,16:08.0,16:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18223,9,1,T1 ,the whole thing is four,,16:12.0,16:12.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18224,9,1,T1 ,,I think so because if you subtract ten from both sides,16:13.0,16:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18225,9,1,T1 ,,then that six x equals twenty-four,16:17.0,16:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18226,9,1,T1 ,,and six times four equals twenty-four right,16:19.0,16:28.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
18227,9,1,T1 ,mm-hmm,,16:23.0,16:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18228,9,1,T1 ,,,16:34.0,17:56.0,01:22.0,,,,,,
18229,9,1,T1 ,,okay,16:34.0,16:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18230,9,1,T1 ,yeah I think you add twenty-two since this one is another variable,,16:34.0,16:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18231,9,1,T1 ,so twenty-two huh sixty-two,,16:39.0,16:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18232,9,1,T1 ,,sixty-two,16:50.0,16:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18233,9,1,T1 ,wait what,,16:53.0,16:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18234,9,1,T1 ,pause filler so would you divide it four,,17:00.0,17:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18235,9,1,T1 ,I think there's something wrong,,17:01.0,17:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18236,9,1,T1 ,so you add twenty-two right,,17:11.0,17:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18237,9,1,T1 ,,yeah you add twenty-two,17:13.0,17:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18238,9,1,T1 ,,so then it would be sixty-two,17:15.0,17:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18239,9,1,T1 ,but then plus fifteen k,,17:17.0,17:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18240,9,1,T1 ,,sixty-two equals fifteen k,17:23.0,17:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18241,9,1,T1 ,oh yeah okay,,17:27.0,17:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18242,9,1,T1 ,,okay and then pause filler,17:32.0,17:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18243,9,1,T1 ,,well sixty-two doesn't go into fifteen or fifteen doesn't go into sixty-two,17:34.0,17:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18244,9,1,T1 ,and I think (inaudible) like it's a decimal,,17:39.0,17:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18245,9,1,T1 ,,yeah,17:41.0,17:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18246,9,1,T1 ,point something,,17:42.0,17:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18247,9,1,T1 ,and just skip it,,17:44.0,17:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18248,9,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm,17:49.0,17:57.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
18249,9,1,T1 ,,,17:58.0,18:38.0,00:40.0,,,,,,
18250,9,1,T1 ,okay minus twelve,,17:59.0,18:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18251,9,1,T1 ,pause filler twenty-one equals seven x,,18:07.0,18:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18252,9,1,T1 ,which is three,,18:10.0,18:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18253,9,1,T1 ,right,,18:15.0,18:15.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18254,9,1,T1 ,,I think so,18:17.0,18:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18255,9,1,T1 ,,wait yeah,18:17.0,18:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18256,9,1,T1 ,,I'll solve twenty-one,18:20.0,18:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18257,9,1,T1 ,are you sure,,18:24.0,18:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18258,9,1,T1 ,,I don't know (laughter),18:26.0,18:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18259,9,1,T1 ,,let's see,18:27.0,18:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18260,9,1,T1 ,,yeah twenty-one,18:28.0,18:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18261,9,1,T1 ,,and you divide it by seven,18:29.0,18:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18262,9,1,T1 ,,so then twenty-one divided by seven is three,18:32.0,18:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18263,9,1,T1 ,,so then x equals three yeah,18:34.0,18:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18264,9,1,T1 ,,,18:42.0,19:10.0,00:28.0,,,,,,
18265,9,1,T1 ,wow,,18:43.0,18:43.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
18266,9,1,T1 ,I don't even think this is on my sheet,,18:43.0,18:54.0,00:11.0,SV,,,,,
18267,9,1,T1 ,you never did no,,18:59.0,19:00.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
18268,9,1,T1 ,I don't know,,19:02.0,19:03.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
18269,9,1,T1 ,,pause filler no,19:04.0,19:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18270,9,1,T1 ,,I think you should skip it,19:04.0,19:09.0,00:05.0,,SV,,,,
18271,9,1,T1 ,,,19:15.0,20:58.0,01:43.0,,,,,,
18272,9,1,T1 ,it's even worse,,19:15.0,19:19.0,00:04.0,SV,,,,,
18273,9,1,T1 ,,are they not on your sheet,19:19.0,19:21.0,00:02.0,,SV,,,,
18274,9,1,T1 ,,or are they on your sheet,19:21.0,19:22.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
18275,9,1,T1 ,I don't know,,19:27.0,19:32.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,
18276,9,1,T1 ,yeah,mm-hmm,19:32.0,19:33.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
18277,9,1,T1 ,oh,,19:33.0,19:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18278,9,1,T1 ,I guess you would subtract k,,19:33.0,19:45.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
18279,9,1,T1 ,so then it will come out as,,19:47.0,19:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18280,9,1,T1 ,I believe it will come out as negative ten since you're carrying it with me,,19:54.0,19:59.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18281,9,1,T1 ,wow,,20:01.0,20:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18282,9,1,T1 ,and then it's seven k minus sixty,,20:03.0,20:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18283,9,1,T1 ,mm-hmm,,20:06.0,20:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18284,9,1,T1 ,and then since this one is (inaudible),,20:07.0,20:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18285,9,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm,20:07.0,20:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18286,9,1,T1 ,I believe you will plus ten to each side,,20:12.0,20:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18287,9,1,T1 ,so then seven k would equal seventy-eight,,20:17.0,20:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18288,9,1,T1 ,but I don't think seven goes into seventy-eight,,20:22.0,20:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18289,9,1,T1 ,pause filler it doesn't,,20:25.0,20:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18290,9,1,T1 ,,I don't think it does,20:26.0,20:31.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18291,9,1,T1 ,it does not seventy,,20:31.0,20:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18292,9,1,T1 ,seventy-seven times,,20:35.0,20:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18293,9,1,T1 ,it will have to come out with the (inaudible),,20:37.0,20:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18294,9,1,T1 ,I guess a fraction,,20:40.0,20:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18295,9,1,T1 ,so I would imagine it will come out as a fraction,,20:44.0,20:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18296,9,1,T1 ,so something will equal k and,,20:49.0,20:56.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
18297,9,1,T1 ,what does k comes as a fraction,,20:56.0,20:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18298,9,1,T1 ,,okay what,20:58.0,20:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18299,9,1,T1 ,I'm on again,,20:58.0,20:59.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
18300,9,1,T1 ,where are they,,21:04.0,21:05.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
18301,9,1,T1 ,,I don't know where they are,21:05.0,21:06.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
18302,9,1,T1 ,well I'm going to go get them,,21:06.0,21:08.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,

18304,9,1,T1 ,moving couldn't get it yeah I'll add it,,21:12.0,21:30.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
18305,9,1,T1 ,(inaudible),,21:30.0,21:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18306,9,1,T1 ,,okay,22:05.0,22:05.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18307,9,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm,22:37.0,22:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

18327,9,1,T1 ,,okay that's good,23:40.0,23:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18328,9,1,T1 ,I'm pretty sure I got those wrong,,23:41.0,23:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18329,9,1,T1 ,I barely could answer,,23:44.0,23:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18330,9,1,T1 ,there's another one,,23:47.0,23:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18331,9,1,T1 ,,I don't know how to work this thing,23:49.0,23:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18332,9,1,T1 ,,it's not like,23:53.0,23:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18333,9,1,T1 ,so you would tract four I mean you would subtract four,,24:07.0,24:19.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
18334,9,1,T1 ,,,24:13.0,27:57.0,03:44.0,,,,,,
18335,9,1,T1 ,,,24:13.0,26:00.0,01:47.0,,,,,,
18336,9,1,T1 ,wait okay so you will minus four,,24:19.0,24:30.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
18337,9,1,T1 ,so then I guess it will be negative thirty-three equals two minus fifteen,,24:30.0,24:41.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
18338,9,1,T1 ,sorry for my handwriting,,24:42.0,24:47.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,
18339,9,1,T1 ,,it's okay,24:47.0,24:48.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
18340,9,1,T1 ,and then oh no I don't know because none of them has the variable,,24:48.0,24:55.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
18341,9,1,T1 ,,pause filler if you subtracted r since you have two rs when you just have an r now,24:55.0,24:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18342,9,1,T1 ,,because,25:01.0,25:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18343,9,1,T1 ,no because I subtract the r,,25:01.0,25:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18344,9,1,T1 ,so that took my rs away,,25:05.0,25:19.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
18345,9,1,T1 ,oh man,,25:19.0,25:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18346,9,1,T1 ,wow (inaudible),,25:20.0,25:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18347,9,1,T1 ,,what's on the paper,25:21.0,25:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18348,9,1,T1 ,you just subtract y from well on this one it says subtract y from both sides,,25:23.0,25:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18349,9,1,T1 ,and you will add the number,,25:28.0,25:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18350,9,1,T1 ,and you will divide it,,25:29.0,25:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18351,9,1,T1 ,but then I wouldn't have anymore immobiles,,25:32.0,25:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18352,9,1,T1 ,I guess I'll just do it,,25:33.0,25:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18353,9,1,T1 ,well minus r,,25:35.0,25:41.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18354,9,1,T1 ,oh man,,25:42.0,25:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18355,9,1,T1 ,so thirty-three equals two minus fifteen,,25:46.0,25:52.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18356,9,1,T1 ,well pause filler I'm just going to skip it,,25:55.0,26:00.0,00:05.0,SV,,,,,
18357,9,1,T1 ,,okay,26:00.0,26:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18358,9,1,T1 ,,,26:06.0,27:57.0,01:51.0,,,,,,
18359,9,1,T1 ,do you (inaudible),,26:06.0,26:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18360,9,1,T1 ,okay,,26:07.0,26:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18361,9,1,T1 ,,no,26:07.0,26:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18362,9,1,T1 ,I do believe he subtract he subtract use of a come negative forty-two,,26:09.0,26:26.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
18363,9,1,T1 ,equals eight plus four,,26:27.0,26:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18364,9,1,T1 ,pause filler now I don't know if we will subtract eight for four,,26:41.0,26:48.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
18365,9,1,T1 ,but I do believe that we might subtract four,,26:49.0,26:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18366,9,1,T1 ,oh it would be thirty-eight I think then it will equal eight,,26:54.0,27:01.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
18367,9,1,T1 ,but I don't know,,27:02.0,27:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18368,9,1,T1 ,eight doesn't go to thirty-eight,,27:02.0,27:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18369,9,1,T1 ,it does on the thirty-two,,27:03.0,27:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18370,9,1,T1 ,pause filler I mean we should match eight,,27:08.0,27:13.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18371,9,1,T1 ,so then if we would minus eight what would come out as a regular solution,,27:17.0,27:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18372,9,1,T1 ,,pause filler plus eight,27:23.0,27:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18373,9,1,T1 ,,what's forty-two minus eight,27:27.0,27:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18374,9,1,T1 ,,it's like thirty something pause filler,27:28.0,27:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18375,9,1,T1 ,yes thirty-two,,27:31.0,27:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18376,9,1,T1 ,,well wouldn't it be thirty-four,27:32.0,27:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18377,9,1,T1 ,no well because four,,27:38.0,27:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18378,9,1,T1 ,,like if you subtracted eight from forty-two wouldn't it be thirty-four,27:41.0,27:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18379,9,1,T1 ,uh-uh,,27:54.0,27:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

18580,9,1,T2 ,,we're going to say it's negative five,39:20.0,39:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18581,9,1,T2 ,,equals y,39:21.0,39:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18582,9,1,T2 ,,there we go okay,39:25.0,39:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

18584,9,1,T2 ,,I think so,39:29.0,39:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18585,9,1,T2 ,,well yeah eighteen pause filler,39:30.0,39:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18586,9,1,T2 ,,I don't know where it sits right,39:34.0,39:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18587,9,1,T2 ,,okay wait I don't know if this is right,39:37.0,39:43.0,00:06.0,,,,,,

18589,9,1,T2 ,oh I'm wrong,,39:45.0,39:45.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18590,9,1,T2 ,,so negative six equals y plus equals twenty-three,39:47.0,39:58.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
18591,9,1,T2 ,oh I think I'm not sure it's like it's something mm-hmm,,39:58.0,40:24.0,00:26.0,,,,,,
18592,9,1,T2 ,,okay and we're going to (inaudible),40:24.0,40:30.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18593,9,1,T2 ,just skip it,,40:30.0,40:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18594,9,1,T2 ,,,40:33.0,42:59.0,02:26.0,,,,,,
18595,9,1,T2 ,,okay and so what okay so negative k minus fourteen equals thirty-six plus k okay so then,40:33.0,40:42.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
18596,9,1,T2 ,minus k right,,40:43.0,40:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18597,9,1,T2 ,,yeah well no wait plus k minus,40:45.0,40:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18598,9,1,T2 ,(inaudible) just negative mm-hmm,,40:49.0,40:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18599,9,1,T2 ,,all right so plus k that looks like a t,40:50.0,40:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18600,9,1,T2 ,,it's not a t,40:54.0,40:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18601,9,1,T2 ,,plus k,40:55.0,40:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18602,9,1,T2 ,,plus k,40:57.0,40:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18603,9,1,T2 ,,pause filler and then it would be negative fourteen,41:00.0,41:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18604,9,1,T2 ,,equals thirty-six,41:07.0,41:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18605,9,1,T2 ,and then plus k,,41:10.0,41:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18606,9,1,T2 ,,plus two k,41:11.0,41:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18607,9,1,T2 ,,what is that,41:14.0,41:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18608,9,1,T2 ,,there we go,41:18.0,41:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18609,9,1,T2 ,,there we go,41:21.0,41:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18610,9,1,T2 ,,okay plus two k,41:22.0,41:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18611,9,1,T2 ,,so you add another k,41:24.0,41:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18612,9,1,T2 ,,stop,41:26.0,41:26.0,00:00.0,SV,,,,,
18613,9,1,T2 ,,and we'll make (inaudible),41:27.0,41:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18614,9,1,T2 ,,okay plus two k,41:31.0,41:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18615,9,1,T2 ,,and then,41:32.0,41:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18616,9,1,T2 ,,but what is pause filler,41:39.0,41:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18617,9,1,T2 ,fourteen,,41:42.0,41:42.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18618,9,1,T2 ,,no wait oh we subtract thirty-six to get k by itself,41:43.0,41:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18619,9,1,T2 ,okay well,,41:49.0,41:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18620,9,1,T2 ,,okay so then,41:51.0,41:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18621,9,1,T2 ,,why does it always have to be negative numbers,41:52.0,41:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18622,9,1,T2 ,,oh wait it's negative fourteen minus forty-six,41:55.0,42:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18623,9,1,T2 ,,would it be,42:01.0,42:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18624,9,1,T2 ,positive,,42:01.0,42:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18625,9,1,T2 ,,positive yeah okay,42:02.0,42:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18626,9,1,T2 ,,so fourteen thirty-six twenty forty,42:04.0,42:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18627,9,1,T2 ,,fifty,42:09.0,42:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18628,9,1,T2 ,,fifty,42:10.0,42:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18629,9,1,T2 ,,we're going to say it's fifty,42:12.0,42:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18630,9,1,T2 ,I always have a calculator,,42:15.0,42:16.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,
18631,9,1,T2 ,,fifty equals two k oh,42:17.0,42:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18632,9,1,T2 ,I thought no it wouldn't be k square since you have two ks,,42:23.0,42:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18633,9,1,T2 ,,no because we just added like pause filler this k to this k,42:26.0,42:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18634,9,1,T2 ,,so then you have two ks,42:30.0,42:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18635,9,1,T2 ,,so you just make it two k,42:32.0,42:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18636,9,1,T2 ,,so then you just divide it by two divide it by two,42:35.0,42:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18637,9,1,T2 ,,the answer is twenty-five plus,42:40.0,42:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18638,9,1,T2 ,plus k,,42:44.0,42:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18639,9,1,T2 ,,here we go,42:50.0,42:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18640,9,1,T2 ,,okay oh get away,42:54.0,42:57.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
18641,9,1,T2 ,,okay here we go,42:58.0,42:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18642,9,1,T2 ,,next is pause filler four pause filler seventeen minus eight equals thirteen plus b,42:59.0,43:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18643,9,1,T2 ,,,42:59.0,44:10.0,01:11.0,,,,,,
18644,9,1,T2 ,,what is this,43:04.0,43:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18645,9,1,T2 ,,oh this is the same kind of thing,43:09.0,43:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18646,9,1,T2 ,,okay pause filler so then we just add b,43:14.0,43:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18647,9,1,T2 ,,add b,43:22.0,43:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18648,9,1,T2 ,,y is doing this,43:24.0,43:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18649,9,1,T2 ,,okay so then it's seventeen equals,43:25.0,43:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18650,9,1,T2 ,thirteen plus b,,43:30.0,43:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

18653,9,1,T2 ,,so then we just subtract thirteen,43:37.0,43:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18654,9,1,T2 ,,subtract thirteen to get seventeen minus thirteen,43:41.0,43:50.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
18655,9,1,T2 ,,pause filler four,43:51.0,43:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18656,9,1,T2 ,,so four,43:52.0,43:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18657,9,1,T2 ,,it's four okay,43:53.0,43:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18658,9,1,T2 ,,four equals two b,43:55.0,43:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18659,9,1,T2 ,,and then over two divided by two,44:01.0,44:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18660,9,1,T2 ,,final answer is two equals (inaudible),44:05.0,44:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18661,9,1,T2 ,,,44:10.0,44:46.0,00:36.0,,,,,,
18662,9,1,T2 ,,okay next one,44:10.0,44:17.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
18663,9,1,T2 ,,pause filler okay so equals oh okay,44:17.0,44:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18664,9,1,T2 ,,so then we divide a negative nine by,44:21.0,44:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18665,9,1,T2 ,,divide by negative nine,44:26.0,44:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18666,9,1,T2 ,,there we go,44:33.0,44:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18667,9,1,T2 ,,pause filler okay so then y equals,44:36.0,44:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18668,9,1,T2 ,negative nine,,44:40.0,44:45.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18669,9,1,T2 ,,yeah okay next one,44:46.0,44:53.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
18670,9,1,T2 ,,,44:46.0,46:10.0,01:24.0,,,,,,
18671,9,1,T2 ,,pause filler eighty-two plus eight eighty-two equals negative eighty y plus ten,44:53.0,44:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18672,9,1,T2 ,,I got it pause filler,44:58.0,44:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18673,9,1,T2 ,you'd minus ten right or not okay,,44:58.0,45:09.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
18674,9,1,T2 ,,yeah minus ten,45:09.0,45:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18675,9,1,T2 ,,and then minus ten,45:13.0,45:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18676,9,1,T2 ,,so it's going to be seventy-two,45:16.0,45:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18677,9,1,T2 ,,okay seventy-two,45:19.0,45:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18678,9,1,T2 ,,okay and then we yeah okay,45:22.0,45:36.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
18679,9,1,T2 ,,so we divide it by eight negative eight,45:36.0,45:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18680,9,1,T2 ,,yeah divide it by negative eight pause filler eight,45:43.0,45:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18681,9,1,T2 ,eleven right,,45:50.0,45:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18682,9,1,T2 ,,so wait yeah okay,45:50.0,45:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18683,9,1,T2 ,,so then yeah wait so if we divide it by negative it would be,45:54.0,45:59.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18684,9,1,T2 ,it will come out as a negative,,45:59.0,46:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18685,9,1,T2 ,,I think so,46:01.0,46:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18686,9,1,T2 ,,and what I said is negative nine,46:02.0,46:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18687,9,1,T2 ,,oh my god,46:04.0,46:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18688,9,1,T2 ,,okay here we go,46:06.0,46:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18689,9,1,T2 ,,got it,46:09.0,46:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18690,9,1,T2 ,,,46:11.0,47:32.0,01:21.0,,,,,,
18691,9,1,T2 ,,okay pause filler I think so again minus sixty-five equals fourteen,46:11.0,46:17.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18692,9,1,T2 ,,oh that's an equal sign,46:17.0,46:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18693,9,1,T2 ,,oh that's an equal sign,46:19.0,46:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18694,9,1,T2 ,,it doesn't look like one,46:21.0,46:22.0,00:01.0,SV,,,,,
18695,9,1,T2 ,I don't see it on my screen,,46:23.0,46:30.0,00:07.0,,SV,,,,
18696,9,1,T2 ,,that's the equals sign,46:31.0,46:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18697,9,1,T2 ,,okay pause filler one is seven equals sixty-five,46:34.0,46:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18698,9,1,T2 ,,okay so then we subtract sixty-five,46:36.0,46:41.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18699,9,1,T2 ,,subtract sixty-five,46:41.0,46:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18700,9,1,T2 ,,one o seven minus sixty-five is two something forty-two,46:46.0,46:54.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
18701,9,1,T2 ,,I guess forty-two,46:54.0,46:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18702,9,1,T2 ,mm-hmm mm-hmm,,46:56.0,46:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18703,9,1,T2 ,,okay so forty-two equals negative fourteen x,47:00.0,47:08.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
18704,9,1,T2 ,,okay so then we divide it by negative fourteen,47:09.0,47:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18705,9,1,T2 ,,negative fourteen,47:13.0,47:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18706,9,1,T2 ,it's three,,47:17.0,47:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18707,9,1,T2 ,,okay so it's three,47:18.0,47:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18708,9,1,T2 ,mm-hmm,,47:20.0,47:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18709,9,1,T2 ,,okay so then y so do that,47:21.0,47:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18710,9,1,T2 ,,three equals x,47:24.0,47:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18711,9,1,T2 ,,there we go,47:27.0,47:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18712,9,1,T2 ,,thanks,47:27.0,47:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18713,9,1,T2 ,,,47:32.0,48:51.0,01:19.0,,,,,,
18714,9,1,T2 ,,four equals negative forty-one minus nine k okay,47:32.0,47:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18715,9,1,T2 ,,so then we add forty-one,47:38.0,47:43.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18716,9,1,T2 ,,add forty-one,47:43.0,47:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18717,9,1,T2 ,,so thirty-four plus forty-one equals seven,47:48.0,47:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18718,9,1,T2 ,seventy-five,,47:51.0,47:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18719,9,1,T2 ,,seventy-five okay so seventy-five equals negative nine negative nine k k,47:53.0,48:03.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
18720,9,1,T2 ,,so then you divide it by nine divide it by nine,48:03.0,48:09.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18721,9,1,T2 ,but I can't go to seventy-five,,48:09.0,48:16.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
18722,9,1,T2 ,and it doesn't move,,48:16.0,48:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18723,9,1,T2 ,,okay pause filler so nine goes into seventy-two right,48:17.0,48:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18724,9,1,T2 ,mm-hmm,,48:18.0,48:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18725,9,1,T2 ,,so are you going to say it's like eight point something,48:20.0,48:27.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
18726,9,1,T2 ,mm-hmm,,48:20.0,48:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18727,9,1,T2 ,,eight point whatever,48:28.0,48:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18728,9,1,T2 ,,okay pause filler,48:31.0,48:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18729,9,1,T2 ,oh no,,48:41.0,48:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18730,9,1,T2 ,,number x equals number,48:41.0,48:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18731,9,1,T2 ,,and equals number so,48:46.0,48:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18732,9,1,T2 ,okay,,48:51.0,48:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18733,9,1,T2 ,,oh add p,48:51.0,48:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18734,9,1,T2 ,,,48:51.0,50:34.0,01:43.0,,,,,,
18735,9,1,T2 ,yeah,,48:53.0,48:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18736,9,1,T2 ,,so add p,48:54.0,48:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18737,9,1,T2 ,,add p,48:58.0,48:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18738,9,1,T2 ,,so then it would be negative fifty-two equals nine,49:00.0,49:09.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
18739,9,1,T2 ,,and it would be nine p minus sixteen,49:09.0,49:15.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18740,9,1,T2 ,,okay so then we do plus okay plus sixteen,49:18.0,49:28.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
18741,9,1,T2 ,,plus sixteen,49:28.0,49:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18742,9,1,T2 ,,and then six seven eight,49:30.0,49:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18743,9,1,T2 ,,so sixty-eight,49:33.0,49:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18744,9,1,T2 ,,pause filler oh wait it's negative pause filler,49:34.0,49:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18745,9,1,T2 ,,is that,49:39.0,49:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18746,9,1,T2 ,eight equals nine p,,49:42.0,49:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18747,9,1,T2 ,,wait if it's negative,49:46.0,49:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18748,9,1,T2 ,,and we added sixteen,49:47.0,49:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18749,9,1,T2 ,,I think we like forty something forty-eight,49:49.0,49:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18750,9,1,T2 ,,I don't know,49:53.0,49:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18751,9,1,T2 ,,so it's forty-eight,49:54.0,49:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18752,9,1,T2 ,,so I think because we added a number to a negative,49:55.0,49:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18753,9,1,T2 ,,it would be thirty-nine,50:00.0,50:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18754,9,1,T2 ,,twenty-eight okay,50:07.0,50:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18755,9,1,T2 ,,forty-eight equals nine p,50:08.0,50:19.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
18756,9,1,T2 ,,then nine,50:19.0,50:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18757,9,1,T2 ,,does nine go into forty-eight thirty-four no,50:21.0,50:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18758,9,1,T2 ,it's a decimal,,50:30.0,50:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18759,9,1,T2 ,,nope no decimals,50:32.0,50:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18760,9,1,T2 ,,okay pause filler negative forty-one minus okay so okay,50:34.0,50:42.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
18761,9,1,T2 ,,,50:34.0,52:52.0,02:18.0,,,,,,
18762,9,1,T2 ,,so we do pause filler,50:42.0,50:42.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18763,9,1,T2 ,,what,50:42.0,50:42.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18764,9,1,T2 ,,okay I think we do,50:45.0,50:59.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
18765,9,1,T2 ,,plus fourteen,50:59.0,51:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18766,9,1,T2 ,,plus fourteen,51:07.0,51:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18767,9,1,T2 ,,and then that's negative one forty-one equals,51:10.0,51:20.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
18768,9,1,T2 ,,pause filler nineteen plus twenty-six thirty forty,51:20.0,51:29.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
18769,9,1,T2 ,,plus forty w okay,51:29.0,51:34.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18770,9,1,T2 ,,and then two minus nineteen,51:34.0,51:41.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
18771,9,1,T2 ,,minus nineteen,51:41.0,51:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18772,9,1,T2 ,twenty-two right,,51:45.0,51:53.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
18773,9,1,T2 ,,what,51:53.0,51:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18774,9,1,T2 ,isn't it twenty-two,,51:57.0,52:03.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18775,9,1,T2 ,,what is,52:03.0,52:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18776,9,1,T2 ,,this,52:04.0,52:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18777,9,1,T2 ,yeah one forty-one minus nineteen will be positive twenty-two,,52:06.0,52:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18778,9,1,T2 ,or nine yeah no yeah,,52:11.0,52:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18779,9,1,T2 ,,oh wait negative one twenty-two right wait,52:12.0,52:18.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18780,9,1,T2 ,so (inaudible),,52:21.0,52:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
18781,9,1,T2 ,no no no we will jump up the positive right,,52:21.0,52:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
18782,9,1,T2 ,,because like pause filler I don't know pause filler,52:28.0,52:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18783,9,1,T2 ,,why is this so confusing,52:31.0,52:37.0,00:06.0,SV,,,,,
18784,9,1,T2 ,,I don't know,52:37.0,52:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

18788,9,1,T2 ,again I mean pause filler,,52:44.0,52:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18789,9,1,T2 ,I'm getting (inaudible) six fifty-five,,52:45.0,52:52.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
18790,9,1,T2 ,,last time I went out to get him,52:52.0,53:03.0,00:11.0,SV,,,,,
18791,9,1,T2 ,,and he was like okay,53:03.0,53:06.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
18792,9,1,T2 ,,and then he just gave us our problems to do,53:06.0,53:09.0,00:03.0,SV,,,,,
18793,9,1,T2 ,I don't know if I should go,,53:09.0,53:18.0,00:09.0,,SV,,,,
18794,9,1,T2 ,and get her or what,,53:18.0,53:19.0,00:01.0,,SV,,,,

18798,9,1,T2 ,,and find you because that's what she did the last time,53:24.0,53:39.0,00:15.0,SV,,,,,
18799,9,1,T2 ,,okay I can do that,53:40.0,53:51.0,00:11.0,SV,,,,,
18800,9,1,T2 ,say what this one,,54:01.0,54:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18801,9,1,T2 ,,,54:22.0,55:40.0,01:18.0,,,,,,
18802,9,1,T2 ,,,54:22.0,55:40.0,01:18.0,,,,,,
18803,9,1,T2 ,,okay okay pause filler it's same,54:22.0,54:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
18804,9,1,T2 ,,I think you would add y pause filler,54:26.0,54:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18805,9,1,T2 ,,yes maybe okay,54:30.0,54:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18806,9,1,T2 ,,or is going to add y,54:32.0,54:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18807,9,1,T2 ,,add y,54:36.0,54:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18808,9,1,T2 ,,so then there's negative sixty-three equals forty-three plus two y,54:38.0,54:49.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
18809,9,1,T2 ,,and then minus,54:49.0,54:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18810,9,1,T2 ,,oh no it's another negative,54:52.0,54:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
18811,9,1,T2 ,would it be positive twenty,,55:05.0,55:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
18812,9,1,T2 ,or am I going the wrong way here,,55:10.0,55:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
18813,9,1,T2 ,,pause filler I don't know maybe,55:12.0,55:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
18814,9,1,T2 ,,I really want a calculator,55:13.0,55:15.0,00:02.0,SV,,,,,
18815,9,1,T2 ,well no because then it would be two y because two can go into twenty,,55:15.0,55:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,

112,10,1,S1  ,,me neither I mean really like next to you because as I walked over,06:32.0,06:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
113,10,1,S1  ,I saw you yeah,,06:37.0,06:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
114,10,1,S1  ,,yeah,06:38.0,06:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
115,10,1,S1  ,because I was like that girls is familiar,,06:38.0,06:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
116,10,1,S1  ,,yeah could you see them list,06:41.0,06:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
117,10,1,S1  ,,I don't know what they're doing,06:44.0,06:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
118,10,1,S1  ,I can't see from here so,,06:46.0,06:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
119,10,1,S1  ,,yeah well they're like in the other room,06:47.0,06:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
120,10,1,S1  ,,but it's a clear wall,06:49.0,06:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
121,10,1,S1  ,,so I don't know what they're clinging right now,06:50.0,06:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
122,10,1,S1  ,,oh they're leaving again,06:52.0,06:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
123,10,1,S1  ,,oh well we still wait more,06:53.0,06:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
124,10,1,S1  ,,oh she's bringing a pen,06:54.0,06:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
125,10,1,S1  ,,maybe they're fixed,06:55.0,06:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
126,10,1,S1  ,,okay,06:58.0,06:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
127,10,1,S1  ,,do I have to pause filler hold this down,07:09.0,07:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
128,10,1,S1  ,,I can't hear that well,07:32.0,07:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
129,10,1,S1  ,,I just don't hold this,07:33.0,07:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
130,10,1,S1  ,,pause filler nope,07:41.0,07:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
131,10,1,S1  ,is it the questions in the future to do,,07:45.0,07:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
132,10,1,S1  ,yeah I don't want to a little mess so (laughter),,08:08.0,08:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
133,10,1,S1  ,that's twenty problems,,08:38.0,08:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
134,10,1,S1  ,nah okay what is oh I have this,,08:47.0,08:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
135,10,1,S1  ,I think so,,08:51.0,08:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
136,10,1,S1  ,,that was me,08:55.0,08:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
137,10,1,S1  ,oh my god another ah what the,,09:00.0,09:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
138,10,1,S1  ,here we go (laughter),,09:08.0,09:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
139,10,1,T1 ,,,09:14.0,28:10.0,18:56.0,,,,,,
140,10,1,T1 ,,,09:15.0,10:59.0,01:44.0,,,,,,
141,10,1,T1 ,great,,09:15.0,09:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
142,10,1,T1 ,,okay teach me,09:16.0,09:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
143,10,1,T1 ,pause filler so do you see the x minus x equals thirteen,,09:21.0,09:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
144,10,1,T1 ,,yup I see it same place you are,09:25.0,09:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
145,10,1,T1 ,I'm guessing this is a question we're working on and I thought,,09:27.0,09:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
146,10,1,T1 ,,yup pause filler just don't push the button,09:32.0,09:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
147,10,1,T1 ,,that's all I was told,09:34.0,09:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
148,10,1,T1 ,yeah (laughter),,09:36.0,09:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
149,10,1,T1 ,,okay I'm ready,09:36.0,09:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
150,10,1,T1 ,don't press anything,,09:38.0,09:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
151,10,1,T1 ,just solve the problem (laughter),,09:39.0,09:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
152,10,1,T1 ,so I have no idea how to explain this (laughter),,09:40.0,09:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
153,10,1,T1 ,,it's okay,09:45.0,09:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
154,10,1,T1 ,,I already kind of understand this,09:46.0,09:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
155,10,1,T1 ,,so just do your best,09:48.0,09:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
156,10,1,T1 ,what I know and do for this is just do the opposite (laughter),,09:50.0,09:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
157,10,1,T1 ,so like if you do x minus six this is thirteen plus six,,09:55.0,09:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
158,10,1,T1 ,that's the answer,,09:58.0,09:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
159,10,1,T1 ,,okay like the opposite operation all right should I do this,09:59.0,10:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
160,10,1,T1 ,,or should you do this,10:03.0,10:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
161,10,1,T1 ,I think you (laughter),,10:05.0,10:05.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
162,10,1,T1 ,,okay,10:05.0,10:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
163,10,1,T1 ,it's just a thirteen plus six I mean,,10:06.0,10:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
164,10,1,T1 ,,this is hard to draw plus six okay,10:09.0,10:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
165,10,1,T1 ,no that is okay,,10:13.0,10:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
166,10,1,T1 ,,plus six so that would mean x equal to,10:18.0,10:25.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
167,10,1,T1 ,,that was a really bad equal to sign,10:25.0,10:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
168,10,1,T1 ,,I don't know what that is,10:28.0,10:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
169,10,1,T1 ,,I'm scared of it okay oh well nineteen,10:31.0,10:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
170,10,1,T1 ,,that's not a nine one minute okay wait,10:37.0,10:43.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
171,10,1,T1 ,,this is confusing,10:43.0,10:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
172,10,1,T1 ,,okay I think I got it now nineteen,10:46.0,10:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
173,10,1,T1 ,,there's my sloppy answer,10:50.0,10:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
174,10,1,T1 ,so then you can like double check it by nineteen minus six equals,,10:52.0,10:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
175,10,1,T1 ,,yeah that's a good trick okay,10:56.0,10:59.0,00:03.0,,,,LPP,,
176,10,1,T1 ,,so I guess we'll move onto the next page now,10:59.0,11:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
177,10,1,T1 ,I suppose,,11:01.0,11:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
178,10,1,T1 ,so let's see if I can do that while messing out,,11:02.0,11:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
179,10,1,T1 ,,,11:02.0,13:09.0,02:07.0,,,,,,
180,10,1,T1 ,,okay I'm on it,11:05.0,11:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
181,10,1,T1 ,,do you see it,11:06.0,11:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
182,10,1,T1 ,yeah I'm trying to get down good,,11:06.0,11:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
183,10,1,T1 ,I am not good at this,,11:08.0,11:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
184,10,1,T1 ,,okay just like okay do you see it,11:10.0,11:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
185,10,1,T1 ,,fifteen equals negative eight plus p or a q whatever,11:13.0,11:22.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
186,10,1,T1 ,so (laughter),,11:25.0,11:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
187,10,1,T1 ,,are you on the first page or the second page,11:26.0,11:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
188,10,1,T1 ,second I see fifteen equals minus eight equals p,,11:29.0,11:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
189,10,1,T1 ,,okay,11:32.0,11:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
190,10,1,T1 ,so I'm guessing I'll do achy nose achy nose ah (laughter) so just that like minus eight to each side I think,,11:35.0,11:50.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
191,10,1,T1 ,,oh yeah,11:50.0,11:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
192,10,1,T1 ,that's what I'm doing here,,11:50.0,11:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
193,10,1,T1 ,,well at least minus negative eight yeah,11:54.0,11:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
194,10,1,T1 ,yeah so add negative eight to both I suppose,,11:58.0,12:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
195,10,1,T1 ,,yeah which is just basically just adding the (inaudible) no right,12:01.0,12:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
196,10,1,T1 ,or no add eight to each,,12:05.0,12:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
197,10,1,T1 ,because eight minus eight equals eight equals zero so,,12:07.0,12:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
198,10,1,T1 ,,so plus yeah because it should not be those like a positive,12:10.0,12:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
199,10,1,T1 ,,I think,12:15.0,12:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
200,10,1,T1 ,,I don't know,12:16.0,12:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
201,10,1,T1 ,over or just a regular number plus a negative,,12:17.0,12:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
202,10,1,T1 ,,yeah well if you're subtracting wait one second yeah because we're subtracting negative eight,12:21.0,12:30.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
203,10,1,T1 ,,which would make it just adding eight pause filler plus eight plus eight,12:30.0,12:38.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
204,10,1,T1 ,what did you do to that,,12:38.0,12:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
205,10,1,T1 ,,so that would make this side just p,12:41.0,12:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
206,10,1,T1 ,,and oh jeez this is confusing okay,12:47.0,12:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
207,10,1,T1 ,,and that would make this side ninety-three right yeah,12:52.0,13:00.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
208,10,1,T1 ,yeah (laughter) the mental math there for a second,,13:01.0,13:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
209,10,1,T1 ,,I'm really about it for some reason,13:05.0,13:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
210,10,1,T1 ,,I need to show me a flash cards,13:08.0,13:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
211,10,1,T1 ,,,13:09.0,14:12.0,01:03.0,,,,,,
212,10,1,T1 ,,okay I'm on page three now,13:09.0,13:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
213,10,1,T1 ,,I'll wait for you actually okay,13:11.0,13:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
214,10,1,T1 ,so seventeen I think,,13:17.0,13:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
215,10,1,T1 ,because you're trying to find the k,,13:21.0,13:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
216,10,1,T1 ,like what plus eleven would equal seventeen,,13:22.0,13:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
217,10,1,T1 ,,yeah,13:26.0,13:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
218,10,1,T1 ,so seventeen minus eleven,,13:27.0,13:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
219,10,1,T1 ,,okay,13:30.0,13:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
220,10,1,T1 ,then eleven minus eleven,,13:30.0,13:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
221,10,1,T1 ,,yeah I would just do,13:32.0,13:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
222,10,1,T1 ,,you do one side to do on another side minus eleven to the side equals k,13:35.0,13:46.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
223,10,1,T1 ,,that looks like an r oops okay,13:46.0,13:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
224,10,1,T1 ,well it doesn't have to be perfect just,,13:51.0,13:58.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
225,10,1,T1 ,it has to have the answer,,13:58.0,13:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
226,10,1,T1 ,,yeah okay pause filler I'm sorry,13:59.0,14:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
227,10,1,T1 ,,I'm a perfectionist I (inaudible),14:02.0,14:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
228,10,1,T1 ,me too (inaudible),,14:04.0,14:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
229,10,1,T1 ,,okay six right okay,14:06.0,14:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
230,10,1,T1 ,yup that's six equals,,14:08.0,14:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
231,10,1,T1 ,,oops I skipped too many pages,14:12.0,14:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
232,10,1,T1 ,,all right I'm on page four,14:14.0,14:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
233,10,1,T1 ,,,14:14.0,21:49.0,07:35.0,,,,,,
234,10,1,T1 ,I got it too,,14:17.0,14:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
235,10,1,T1 ,,is this like forty-four yeah,14:18.0,14:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
236,10,1,T1 ,,and this looks to be an x,14:20.0,14:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
237,10,1,T1 ,forty-four x or forty-times one equals,,14:22.0,14:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
238,10,1,T1 ,,yeah,14:26.0,14:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
239,10,1,T1 ,wait x stands as a multiplication sign,,14:27.0,14:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
240,10,1,T1 ,and that the same thing is,,14:29.0,14:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
241,10,1,T1 ,,yeah but I'm thinking if in algebra they would use this sign that circle,14:31.0,14:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
242,10,1,T1 ,they don't use a sign,,14:37.0,14:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
243,10,1,T1 ,they just make you pretty much,,14:38.0,14:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
244,10,1,T1 ,they put the letters together,,14:40.0,14:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
245,10,1,T1 ,so that's forty-four x equals forty-time whatever,,14:41.0,14:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
246,10,1,T1 ,it equal so two hundred and twenty divided by forty-four pretty much,,14:46.0,14:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
247,10,1,T1 ,,this is what you want to do okay,14:50.0,14:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
248,10,1,T1 ,I think,,14:53.0,14:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
249,10,1,T1 ,,usually (inaudible) like you're teaching me so I'm going to try this I think,14:54.0,14:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
250,10,1,T1 ,I just used the opposite,,14:57.0,14:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
251,10,1,T1 ,because the opposite of multiplication is division I mean,,14:58.0,15:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
252,10,1,T1 ,,yeah but then you have to make sure you're doing it to both sides,15:01.0,15:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
253,10,1,T1 ,,because the goal is to cancel the variable out,15:04.0,15:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
254,10,1,T1 ,,so I don't think,15:09.0,15:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
255,10,1,T1 ,,I know this is depressing,15:11.0,15:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
256,10,1,T1 ,,and I'm going to have to write this out,15:14.0,15:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
257,10,1,T1 ,I can't help you if you want I mean,,15:19.0,15:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
258,10,1,T1 ,,okay you want to do the whole division,15:22.0,15:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
259,10,1,T1 ,,that's my weakness for all things,15:24.0,15:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
260,10,1,T1 ,,like I'm good with concepts,15:28.0,15:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
261,10,1,T1 ,,but like computation I'm slow at it,15:30.0,15:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
262,10,1,T1 ,oh my gosh I suck at writing this thing,,15:32.0,15:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
263,10,1,T1 ,,yeah it's kind of hard,15:36.0,15:51.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
264,10,1,T1 ,(sfx) (laughter) oh so pretty much forty-four will go and not going to do,,15:51.0,15:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
265,10,1,T1 ,forty-four wouldn't go into twenty-two so,,15:56.0,15:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
266,10,1,T1 ,,yeah you got to do it,15:58.0,16:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
267,10,1,T1 ,zero equals,,16:00.0,16:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
268,10,1,T1 ,,two twenty,16:01.0,16:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
269,10,1,T1 ,zero where is the calculator (laughter),,16:02.0,16:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
270,10,1,T1 ,,I don't know,16:06.0,16:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
271,10,1,T1 ,,wait there's a bunch of other tools,16:08.0,16:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
272,10,1,T1 ,,but we weren't told what those are,16:10.0,16:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
273,10,1,T1 ,,so I'm guessing we're not supposed to use this,16:12.0,16:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
274,10,1,T1 ,I wonder if I'm allowed to use this scratch paper,,16:15.0,16:21.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
275,10,1,T1 ,,pause filler I don't know,16:21.0,16:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
276,10,1,T1 ,,(inaudible) I'm pretty sure they want us to do it on the screen,16:21.0,16:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
277,10,1,T1 ,,I don't know,16:25.0,16:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
278,10,1,T1 ,I know this is hard,,16:25.0,16:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
279,10,1,T1 ,,to stay for later,16:27.0,16:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
280,10,1,T1 ,so they're coming,,16:31.0,16:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
281,10,1,T1 ,,here I think I'm at two,16:33.0,16:41.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
282,10,1,T1 ,(laughter) eighty-eight,,16:41.0,16:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
283,10,1,T1 ,,(inaudible),16:43.0,16:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
284,10,1,T1 ,,hey that's forty-four,16:45.0,16:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
285,10,1,T1 ,,yeah use your pause filler actual pen like you can,16:47.0,16:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
286,10,1,T1 ,yeah one twenty-two nope that's twenty-five I think,,16:50.0,17:26.0,00:36.0,,,,,,
287,10,1,T1 ,,okay,17:26.0,17:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
288,10,1,T1 ,I'm looking for an assembly in this thing,,17:27.0,17:34.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
289,10,1,T1 ,,okay,17:34.0,17:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
290,10,1,T1 ,okay yeah currently we're doing it right pause filler (laughter),,17:35.0,17:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
291,10,1,T1 ,,okay pause filler I can't tell if I'm in the frame,17:38.0,17:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
292,10,1,T1 ,,because there's a warning sign like covering me up,17:40.0,17:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
293,10,1,T1 ,,so sorry if you can't see me,17:44.0,17:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
294,10,1,T1 ,yeah you're right in the middle,,17:46.0,17:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
295,10,1,T1 ,so am I,,17:47.0,17:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
296,10,1,T1 ,,okay good yeah you're good,17:48.0,17:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
297,10,1,T1 ,cool I might need over here a little bit,,17:50.0,17:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
298,10,1,T1 ,but that's just because I'm looking at those,,17:52.0,17:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
299,10,1,T1 ,,okay,17:56.0,17:56.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
300,10,1,T1 ,so yeah like do you think what I have is like twelve equals twenty-four so,,17:56.0,18:03.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
301,10,1,T1 ,and I'm just going twelve over twelve,,18:03.0,18:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
302,10,1,T1 ,,yeah that's like basically what ours is,18:05.0,18:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
303,10,1,T1 ,,so do we do it right so far at least the dividing by forty-four,18:10.0,18:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
304,10,1,T1 ,yeah,,18:13.0,18:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
305,10,1,T1 ,,okay,18:13.0,18:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
306,10,1,T1 ,that's just pretty much how many time forty-four,,18:13.0,18:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
307,10,1,T1 ,I can go with that,,18:18.0,18:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
308,10,1,T1 ,,okay okay so forty-four plus forty-four it's eighty-eight and then eighty-eight,18:19.0,18:27.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
309,10,1,T1 ,,that's forty-four,18:27.0,18:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
310,10,1,T1 ,,is there a faster way to do this,18:29.0,18:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
311,10,1,T1 ,I wish calculator up (laughter),,18:31.0,18:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
312,10,1,T1 ,,yeah,18:34.0,18:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
313,10,1,T1 ,one seventy-six equals forty-four,,18:35.0,18:44.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
314,10,1,T1 ,,here okay,18:46.0,18:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
315,10,1,T1 ,another four so far so,,18:49.0,18:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
316,10,1,T1 ,,okay yeah you're closer than I am,18:52.0,18:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
317,10,1,T1 ,,so I guess I'll wait,18:54.0,18:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
318,10,1,T1 ,I got it,,19:07.0,19:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
319,10,1,T1 ,,yeah okay how much is it,19:09.0,19:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
320,10,1,T1 ,so for me I just want the (inaudible) though (laughter),,19:10.0,19:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
321,10,1,T1 ,,okay what do you,19:13.0,19:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
322,10,1,T1 ,so I think it's either five or six I'm fine with,,19:14.0,19:31.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
323,10,1,T1 ,,why would it seems more reasonable,19:31.0,19:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
324,10,1,T1 ,five,,19:41.0,19:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
325,10,1,T1 ,,okay so five go right here,19:41.0,19:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
326,10,1,T1 ,,and how many five times was it exactly,19:45.0,19:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
327,10,1,T1 ,,do you remember what five times forty-four was,19:50.0,19:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
328,10,1,T1 ,I'm double-checking that now,,19:54.0,19:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
329,10,1,T1 ,,okay,19:55.0,19:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
330,10,1,T1 ,four five let me see (laughter) sounds like make,,19:55.0,20:10.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
331,10,1,T1 ,and now it will work pause filler (laughter),,20:10.0,20:21.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
332,10,1,T1 ,,you do write it down as we're doing the problem is what I'm asking,20:21.0,20:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
333,10,1,T1 ,,and did it fit into it exactly,20:26.0,20:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
334,10,1,T1 ,,because if it did then it's two hundred and twenty,20:28.0,20:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
335,10,1,T1 ,because I just went like forty-four (inaudible) pause filler,,20:32.0,20:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
336,10,1,T1 ,yeah I need to talk,,20:39.0,20:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
337,10,1,T1 ,oh add twenty-five great job,,20:42.0,20:46.0,00:04.0,,,UL,,,
338,10,1,T1 ,,there we go it's back,20:46.0,20:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
339,10,1,T1 ,so I just went like forty-four plus forty-four equals eighty-eight,,20:48.0,20:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
340,10,1,T1 ,so I want eighty-eight plus eighty-eight which would be four,,20:51.0,20:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
341,10,1,T1 ,then I added another forty-four so,,20:54.0,20:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
342,10,1,T1 ,,so the fifth one the fifth forty-four that you added what you end up with was that exactly two hundred and twenty,20:55.0,21:04.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
343,10,1,T1 ,yeah I'm still checking it now one sec,,21:05.0,21:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
344,10,1,T1 ,,okay because if it was then we can just write two hundred twenty,21:06.0,21:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
345,10,1,T1 ,,and then you're left with no remainder,21:12.0,21:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
346,10,1,T1 ,,and so your answer is that's,21:13.0,21:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
347,10,1,T1 ,,I don't know what I did,21:17.0,21:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
348,10,1,T1 ,,so then the answer would be five if it fits exactly is what I'm saying,21:22.0,21:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
349,10,1,T1 ,I think it's five so,,21:27.0,21:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
350,10,1,T1 ,,yeah because you'd subtract this,21:29.0,21:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
351,10,1,T1 ,,I don't know what I'm doing,21:32.0,21:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
352,10,1,T1 ,I keep messing up on pens my pen,,21:33.0,21:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
353,10,1,T1 ,,okay so that one would be five right yeah,21:36.0,21:41.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
354,10,1,T1 ,x equals five maybe (laughter) we hope,,21:41.0,21:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
355,10,1,T1 ,,we think let's just move on,21:46.0,21:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
356,10,1,T1 ,,(inaudible) (laughter),21:49.0,21:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
357,10,1,T1 ,,,21:54.0,27:51.0,05:57.0,,,,,,
358,10,1,T1 ,,okay I think I get how to do this,21:54.0,22:02.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
359,10,1,T1 ,,just tell me like what comes to nine,22:02.0,22:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
360,10,1,T1 ,,or how you would explain how to do it,22:05.0,22:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
361,10,1,T1 ,I'm trying to find the specific thing over here (inaudible) (laughter),,22:11.0,22:18.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
362,10,1,T1 ,,oh my gosh,22:18.0,22:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
363,10,1,T1 ,oh my god (laughter) okay so (inaudible) so we can start this problem,,22:20.0,22:32.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
364,10,1,T1 ,but pause filler (laughter) I have no clue what I'm doing,,22:33.0,22:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
365,10,1,T1 ,,I don't know if I'm supposed to help you,22:36.0,22:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
366,10,1,T1 ,,or like if I know it,22:40.0,22:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
367,10,1,T1 ,,I don't know if I'm supposed to help you,22:41.0,22:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
368,10,1,T1 ,,or wait until I'm tutoring you,22:43.0,22:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
369,10,1,T1 ,,I'm not sure,22:46.0,22:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
370,10,1,T1 ,right now I'm tutoring you,,22:47.0,22:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
371,10,1,T1 ,so I guess I know what I'm doing,,22:48.0,22:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
372,10,1,T1 ,,yeah so I guess I'll just listen hands off,22:50.0,22:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
373,10,1,T1 ,I'm trying to solve it my mind first to see if I get it that's all,,22:56.0,22:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
374,10,1,T1 ,,yeah well you can write it down as you go if you want,22:59.0,23:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
375,10,1,T1 ,like I don't think there's anything wrong with that,,23:03.0,23:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
376,10,1,T1 ,I have memorial hands on stuck on my hand,,23:05.0,23:16.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
377,10,1,T1 ,,I know I feel like coming,23:16.0,23:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
378,10,1,T1 ,,and I'm like wait everyone there's a mic on me,23:17.0,23:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
379,10,1,T1 ,,I probably shouldn't,23:21.0,23:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
380,10,1,T1 ,(laughter) (inaudible) so I guess you'd have to cross cancel the negative number,,23:28.0,23:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
381,10,1,T1 ,,yeah,23:33.0,23:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
382,10,1,T1 ,so like minus nine plus nine and then forty-one plus nine,,23:34.0,23:42.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
383,10,1,T1 ,,okay,23:43.0,23:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
384,10,1,T1 ,maybe (laughter),,23:44.0,23:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
385,10,1,T1 ,,so you want to write that,23:44.0,23:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
386,10,1,T1 ,,or do you want me to,23:45.0,23:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
387,10,1,T1 ,pause filler you because you're a lot better at this (laughter),,23:48.0,23:49.0,00:01.0,,,LP,,,
388,10,1,T1 ,you're a lot better at writing,,23:49.0,23:50.0,00:01.0,,,LPP,,,
389,10,1,T1 ,,okay so you say what do you want me to write again,23:50.0,23:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
390,10,1,T1 ,it's like cross cancel this one,,23:54.0,23:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
391,10,1,T1 ,,so cancel out the negative nine is what you're saying,23:57.0,23:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
392,10,1,T1 ,yeah pretty much,,23:59.0,24:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
393,10,1,T1 ,,okay so you would do add negative nine,24:00.0,24:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
394,10,1,T1 ,,and you have to do that to each side right,24:06.0,24:13.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
395,10,1,T1 ,I think,,24:13.0,24:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
396,10,1,T1 ,,I'm sorry I don't want to like,24:15.0,24:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
397,10,1,T1 ,I'm looking at them,,24:18.0,24:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
398,10,1,T1 ,,okay now what does it say to do,24:23.0,24:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
399,10,1,T1 ,,or what do you want me to do,24:25.0,24:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
400,10,1,T1 ,I guess when you kind of divide,,24:28.0,24:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
401,10,1,T1 ,because you're doing thirteen p which is thirteen times p,,24:32.0,24:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
402,10,1,T1 ,,yeah so,24:37.0,24:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
403,10,1,T1 ,it's like divided by five,,24:39.0,24:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
404,10,1,T1 ,or for us it would be thirteen so forty-one divided by thirteen and thirteen divided thirteen,,24:43.0,24:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
405,10,1,T1 ,,I'm trying to write on this,24:47.0,24:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
406,10,1,T1 ,,so that's yeah okay,24:51.0,24:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
407,10,1,T1 ,,so we should probably do this,24:55.0,24:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
408,10,1,T1 ,,because I wrote it down,24:58.0,25:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
409,10,1,T1 ,,but we didn't actually do it,25:00.0,25:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
410,10,1,T1 ,,so we're left with thirteen oh my gosh,25:01.0,25:06.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
411,10,1,T1 ,,so after we do the first step you told me to do,25:06.0,25:15.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
412,10,1,T1 ,,I get thirteen p equals forty-one,25:15.0,25:25.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
413,10,1,T1 ,,after that we were,25:25.0,25:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
414,10,1,T1 ,well you have to add nine to forty-one,,25:27.0,25:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
415,10,1,T1 ,so that would technically be fifty now,,25:30.0,25:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
416,10,1,T1 ,,oh right you're right,25:33.0,25:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
417,10,1,T1 ,,I forgot to do that,25:33.0,25:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
418,10,1,T1 ,,see this is what tutors are for,25:40.0,25:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
419,10,1,T1 ,,it remind you skip something yeah,25:42.0,25:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
420,10,1,T1 ,,so I'm adding negative nine which is basically just subtracting nine right,25:44.0,25:51.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
421,10,1,T1 ,well you're adding nine,,25:52.0,25:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
422,10,1,T1 ,because minus nine wouldn't if you subtracted it it would be,,25:54.0,25:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
423,10,1,T1 ,,so you want me to add nine,25:59.0,26:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
424,10,1,T1 ,minus fifteen so minus nine plus nine and then forty-one plus nine,,26:00.0,26:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
425,10,1,T1 ,,so fifty,26:04.0,26:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
426,10,1,T1 ,yeah,,26:05.0,26:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
427,10,1,T1 ,,is that what you're saying okay so,26:06.0,26:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
428,10,1,T1 ,the hand minus,,26:07.0,26:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
429,10,1,T1 ,,okay (inaudible) that to make it fifty,26:09.0,26:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
430,10,1,T1 ,,pause filler that's a really bad fifty but what we're doing and then,26:13.0,26:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
431,10,1,T1 ,so then thirteen p you have to divide thirteen by forty-one,,26:17.0,26:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
432,10,1,T1 ,,yeah this is getting really crooked,26:22.0,26:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
433,10,1,T1 ,,you have to tilt your head to see it,26:24.0,26:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
434,10,1,T1 ,,but that's okay,26:27.0,26:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
435,10,1,T1 ,,(inaudible),26:27.0,26:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
436,10,1,T1 ,,yeah so then that gives us p equals,26:33.0,26:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
437,10,1,T1 ,,how many time does thirteen go into fifty and fifteen twenty-six right fifteen twenty-six thirty-nine twenty-two forty-five,26:39.0,26:55.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
438,10,1,T1 ,you can go to forty-two,,26:55.0,26:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
439,10,1,T1 ,but then if you add forty-two plus thirteen it will be forty-five so,,26:58.0,27:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
440,10,1,T1 ,,yeah so that's four right,27:03.0,27:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
441,10,1,T1 ,yeah,,27:05.0,27:05.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
442,10,1,T1 ,,okay so,27:05.0,27:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
443,10,1,T1 ,so you have a remainder,,27:08.0,27:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
444,10,1,T1 ,,yeah but I'm pretty sure,27:10.0,27:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
445,10,1,T1 ,,like with the problems that I did on the paper it is simplified,27:12.0,27:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
446,10,1,T1 ,,so I don't know what they want me to do,27:16.0,27:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

452,10,1,T1 ,,I think we just leave it at that right,27:27.0,27:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
453,10,1,T1 ,,or should we add the remainder or write down the remainder,27:31.0,27:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
454,10,1,T1 ,well the remainder would be pause filler eight so,,27:37.0,27:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
455,10,1,T1 ,,can I just like write r,27:42.0,27:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

591,10,1,T2,,because it just makes it easier,35:41.0,35:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
592,10,1,T2,,and I always split it down the middle on the equals sign like that,35:43.0,35:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
593,10,1,T2,,I don't know why,35:47.0,35:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
594,10,1,T2,,it just makes it easier to like know what to do to one side (inaudible),35:49.0,35:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
595,10,1,T2,,and so what would your first guess be when you want to do this,35:53.0,35:59.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
596,10,1,T2,,because they said not to give you the answers,36:00.0,36:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
597,10,1,T2,,so I don't want to just do it,36:02.0,36:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
598,10,1,T2,I'm just working on my head that's all,,36:04.0,36:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
599,10,1,T2,,okay,36:10.0,36:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
600,10,1,T2,(inaudible) so,,36:10.0,36:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
601,10,1,T2,,yeah,36:12.0,36:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
602,10,1,T2,oh (inaudible) what is going on,,36:15.0,36:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
603,10,1,T2,I'm not touching the board,,36:18.0,36:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
604,10,1,T2,why is it typing,,36:20.0,36:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
605,10,1,T2,,yeah it might do that if you're hovering over it,36:22.0,36:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
606,10,1,T2,,I'm not sure,36:25.0,36:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
607,10,1,T2,oh if you press these buttons I get it,,36:25.0,36:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
608,10,1,T2,,okay wait a minute I'm sorry,36:27.0,36:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
609,10,1,T2,,I undoed everything,36:28.0,36:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
610,10,1,T2,it's fine I don't know it anyway,,36:30.0,36:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
611,10,1,T2,I don't know if you cork this button,,36:35.0,36:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
612,10,1,T2,,so basically,36:37.0,36:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
613,10,1,T2,ah I could not,,36:38.0,36:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
614,10,1,T2,,I'm pretty sure you have the right idea,36:39.0,36:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
615,10,1,T2,,because I could kind of hear you working it out,36:41.0,36:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
616,10,1,T2,my pen is writing,,36:44.0,36:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
617,10,1,T2,oh hit the button people used to (inaudible) again,,36:50.0,36:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
618,10,1,T2,,yeah,36:55.0,36:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
619,10,1,T2,well at least not,,36:55.0,37:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
620,10,1,T2,,pause filler it's not working for me either,37:01.0,37:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
621,10,1,T2,I don't understand,,37:02.0,37:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
622,10,1,T2,,oh well you know what I think it's something,37:05.0,37:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
623,10,1,T2,,(inaudible),37:08.0,37:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
624,10,1,T2,,just ignore it yeah,37:10.0,37:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
625,10,1,T2,and cross goodbye I don't want you,,37:12.0,37:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
626,10,1,T2,so minus three plus three equals zero (laughter),,37:15.0,37:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
627,10,1,T2,twenty-five plus three equals twenty-five twenty-five plus three half,,37:19.0,37:26.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
628,10,1,T2,so now what so that would be x equals no no,,37:26.0,37:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
629,10,1,T2,,how about you add it out like step by step,37:30.0,37:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
630,10,1,T2,,that might help,37:35.0,37:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
631,10,1,T2,,it's what I always do,37:36.0,37:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
632,10,1,T2,,so the goal is to try to cancel out pause filler all of the like coefficient yeah the coefficient which is,37:39.0,37:49.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
633,10,1,T2,,basically you want to cancel out all the constants on this side,37:51.0,37:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
634,10,1,T2,,and then yeah that's basically what you want to do,37:55.0,37:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
635,10,1,T2,so minus three would have to disappear,,37:59.0,38:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
636,10,1,T2,so minus three plus three equals zero,,38:03.0,38:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
637,10,1,T2,twenty-five plus three equals twenty-five,,38:05.0,38:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
638,10,1,T2,twenty-five why did you say twenty-five plus twenty-five well no,,38:08.0,38:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
639,10,1,T2,,no twenty-two (laughter),38:10.0,38:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
640,10,1,T2,eight equals twenty-five,,38:11.0,38:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
641,10,1,T2,that's all right now,,38:13.0,38:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
642,10,1,T2,,okay so you're saying x equals what,38:13.0,38:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
643,10,1,T2,twenty-five yeah because,,38:18.0,38:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
644,10,1,T2,,twenty-five let me put that,38:20.0,38:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
645,10,1,T2,then you can add twenty-five plus minus three which would be yeah,,38:22.0,38:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
646,10,1,T2,,yeah wait one second (inaudible) out of my head,38:25.0,38:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
647,10,1,T2,oh what did I do,,38:28.0,38:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
648,10,1,T2,,do you want me oh,38:30.0,38:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
649,10,1,T2,,I'm trying to write it,38:32.0,38:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
650,10,1,T2,,but it's not working,38:33.0,38:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
651,10,1,T2,(inaudible) press the button oh my god,,38:35.0,38:41.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
652,10,1,T2,that is the worst thing I've ever done,,38:42.0,38:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
653,10,1,T2,and that (inaudible) up with my handwriting twenty-five,,38:45.0,38:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
654,10,1,T2,,there you can tell it's okay,38:49.0,38:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
655,10,1,T2,yay no next one I suppose,,38:50.0,38:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
656,10,1,T2,,,38:56.0,40:30.0,01:34.0,,,,,,
657,10,1,T2,,okay so same thing go down the middle,38:57.0,39:03.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
658,10,1,T2,,try to get,39:04.0,39:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
659,10,1,T2,,cancel out all the pause filler numbers or I guess anything that's not a variable on this side,39:05.0,39:15.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
660,10,1,T2,,wait you call those constants right yeah constants,39:15.0,39:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
661,10,1,T2,I think so,,39:17.0,39:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
662,10,1,T2,,yeah constants and variables,39:19.0,39:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
663,10,1,T2,so we'd have to get rid of eighteen,,39:24.0,39:32.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
664,10,1,T2,eighteen's got to go,,39:32.0,39:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
665,10,1,T2,,yeah so the opposite operation so eighteen is being added which means you were,39:34.0,39:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
666,10,1,T2,so eighteen minus eighteen equals zero,,39:38.0,39:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
667,10,1,T2,twenty-five minus eighteen equals five,,39:41.0,39:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
668,10,1,T2,,okay so,39:46.0,39:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
669,10,1,T2,so yeah it would be five,,39:51.0,39:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
670,10,1,T2,plus twenty-three minus eighteen equals five,,39:52.0,39:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
671,10,1,T2,,so five and I certain times like draw it on the line like that,39:55.0,40:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
672,10,1,T2,,I don't know why I do that,40:01.0,40:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
673,10,1,T2,,it's like so then to the two sides too,40:04.0,40:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
674,10,1,T2,okay so eighteen minus eight eighteen or (laughter) I can't talk,,40:06.0,40:14.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
675,10,1,T2,,so you said five,40:14.0,40:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
676,10,1,T2,,I guess I don't know what a negative y would be,40:16.0,40:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
677,10,1,T2,,I guess it just be negative y,40:18.0,40:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
678,10,1,T2,,like I don't know if you have to do anything like that,40:20.0,40:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
679,10,1,T2,,I guess it's done,40:23.0,40:29.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
680,10,1,T2,so (inaudible),,40:31.0,40:31.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
681,10,1,T2,,,40:31.0,45:55.0,05:24.0,,,,,,
682,10,1,T2,,are you on page three,40:31.0,40:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
683,10,1,T2,yup,,40:33.0,40:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
684,10,1,T2,,I'm confused okay let me see,40:34.0,40:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
685,10,1,T2,,wait a minute okay it's not as bad as I think,40:39.0,40:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
686,10,1,T2,,there's just a lot of negatives so oh okay,40:42.0,40:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
687,10,1,T2,,so the other side you want me the variable on one side,40:48.0,40:54.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
688,10,1,T2,yeah,,40:54.0,40:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
689,10,1,T2,,so to do that you have to what kind of sheet is that is that,40:55.0,41:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
690,10,1,T2,,you have to add,41:01.0,41:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
691,10,1,T2,,so see at once negative or one is a positive,41:03.0,41:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
692,10,1,T2,,so let's say if you add one to each side you cannot see that,41:06.0,41:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
693,10,1,T2,,but oh well you add one to each side,41:12.0,41:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
694,10,1,T2,,then that's cancelling out this one,41:17.0,41:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
695,10,1,T2,,pause filler right here that's right yeah,41:21.0,41:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
696,10,1,T2,,oh it's cancelling out this one,41:26.0,41:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
697,10,1,T2,,so this is like comes zero,41:27.0,41:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
698,10,1,T2,,it's nothing,41:29.0,41:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
699,10,1,T2,,it's just fourteen now,41:31.0,41:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
700,10,1,T2,,pause filler and then this one becomes two okay,41:36.0,41:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
701,10,1,T2,,and then you do it from there,41:40.0,41:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
702,10,1,T2,,so I'm going to write out the problem for you now,41:43.0,41:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
703,10,1,T2,,because it's all messy,41:45.0,41:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
704,10,1,T2,,so fourteen equals thirty-six plus two,41:47.0,41:56.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
705,10,1,T2,,okay so you solve that,41:56.0,41:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
706,10,1,T2,should two be multiplied by k,,41:58.0,42:05.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
707,10,1,T2,,right now it's being multiplied by k yes so,42:05.0,42:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
708,10,1,T2,I don't know how anything multiplied by how,,42:08.0,42:13.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
709,10,1,T2,it would have to be a negative number,,42:13.0,42:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
710,10,1,T2,because you'd have to kind of get fourteen out of thirty-six,,42:17.0,42:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
711,10,1,T2,,yeah do you want me to split down the middle for you,42:22.0,42:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
712,10,1,T2,,I don't know if that helps you,42:25.0,42:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
713,10,1,T2,,but it helps me,42:27.0,42:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
714,10,1,T2,,sorry if it doesn't help you,42:29.0,42:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
715,10,1,T2,,it's like I always just choose a random start,42:30.0,42:38.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
716,10,1,T2,,so you can either start out thirty-six or start at two k,42:38.0,42:43.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
717,10,1,T2,,but either way you're trying to cancel out all of the constants,42:43.0,42:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
718,10,1,T2,,so we start at two k two,42:48.0,42:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
719,10,1,T2,,it's being multiplied by k,42:51.0,42:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
720,10,1,T2,,and so you would do the opposite pause filler operation,42:54.0,42:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
721,10,1,T2,so fourteen divided by two,,42:59.0,43:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
722,10,1,T2,,huh,43:01.0,43:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
723,10,1,T2,so fourteen divided by two,,43:02.0,43:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
724,10,1,T2,,yes fourteen divided by two,43:03.0,43:09.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
725,10,1,T2,seven,,43:09.0,43:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
726,10,1,T2,,seven okay,43:10.0,43:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
727,10,1,T2,seven,,43:13.0,43:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
728,10,1,T2,,I think I'm writing all this,43:15.0,43:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
729,10,1,T2,,but you're still doing the work,43:16.0,43:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
730,10,1,T2,,so I don't want them to think I was doing all this,43:17.0,43:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
731,10,1,T2,,because you're telling me this what to write down,43:19.0,43:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
732,10,1,T2,no I'm just really bad at writing that's all,,43:22.0,43:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
733,10,1,T2,,yeah I think down yeah,43:25.0,43:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
734,10,1,T2,so then (inaudible) I think I hope,,43:27.0,43:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
735,10,1,T2,,yeah I just don't want to watch this and (inaudible) and be like oh that girl didn't teach her anything,43:28.0,43:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
736,10,1,T2,,she just did all the work all right,43:34.0,43:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
737,10,1,T2,,and so seven and what would the other side be,43:38.0,43:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
738,10,1,T2,pause filler minus seven maybe,,43:46.0,43:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
739,10,1,T2,,oh wait why did I degrade at seven,43:47.0,43:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
740,10,1,T2,,oh wait because it is seven sorry,43:49.0,43:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
741,10,1,T2,I just don't get how anything plus thirty-six can equal fourteen,,43:53.0,43:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
742,10,1,T2,,huh,43:57.0,43:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
743,10,1,T2,unless it's negative,,43:58.0,43:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
744,10,1,T2,,yeah so the entire thing is like,43:58.0,44:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
745,10,1,T2,,that's what I want to think about logically,44:01.0,44:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
746,10,1,T2,,but sometimes like pause filler you can if you just follow like the rules,44:03.0,44:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
747,10,1,T2,,and you understand the rules now,44:08.0,44:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
748,10,1,T2,,but we all have different ways of thinking,44:11.0,44:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
749,10,1,T2,,like some people are just like this is the rule,44:12.0,44:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
750,10,1,T2,,and you follow this,44:14.0,44:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
751,10,1,T2,,and we're like well logically that doesn't make sense like that's like,44:15.0,44:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
752,10,1,T2,,I was like well logically like when I was writing negatives and stuff,44:19.0,44:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
753,10,1,T2,,I was like logically it would be this,44:22.0,44:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
754,10,1,T2,,and then they're like nope because this rules is this,44:24.0,44:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
755,10,1,T2,,so it actually will be this,44:26.0,44:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
756,10,1,T2,,yeah so there are stuff like this,44:28.0,44:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
757,10,1,T2,,I just follow,44:31.0,44:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
758,10,1,T2,,I have the certain set of rules,44:32.0,44:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
759,10,1,T2,,and I follow them,44:34.0,44:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
760,10,1,T2,,and that is what you do to one side you do to the other,44:35.0,44:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
761,10,1,T2,,so we divided fourteen by two,44:38.0,44:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
762,10,1,T2,,so I divide this by two,44:45.0,44:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
763,10,1,T2,,pause filler I messed something up,44:47.0,44:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
764,10,1,T2,what would be two divided by two,,44:49.0,44:55.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
765,10,1,T2,,huh,44:55.0,44:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
766,10,1,T2,two divided by two would equal to zero so fourteen divided two,,44:55.0,44:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
767,10,1,T2,,yeah two divided two so which means we're just left with,44:58.0,45:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
768,10,1,T2,,yeah we're just left with seven equals,45:02.0,45:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
769,10,1,T2,thirty-six,,45:05.0,45:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
770,10,1,T2,,thirty-six but we still have plus k,45:06.0,45:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
771,10,1,T2,,because we just cancelled out the two,45:09.0,45:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
772,10,1,T2,,we didn't cancel out the k,45:11.0,45:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
773,10,1,T2,so we have to get one of this thirty-six or seven,,45:14.0,45:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
774,10,1,T2,,no thirty-six because seven yeah,45:19.0,45:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
775,10,1,T2,so thirty-six minus thirty-six equals zero so seven minus thirty-six,,45:23.0,45:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
776,10,1,T2,,yup exactly,45:29.0,45:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
777,10,1,T2,well equal minus twenty-nine,,45:33.0,45:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
778,10,1,T2,hmm,,45:35.0,45:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
779,10,1,T2,negative twenty-nine,,45:36.0,45:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
780,10,1,T2,,yup so negative,45:37.0,45:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
781,10,1,T2,negative twenty-nine equals k,,45:39.0,45:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
782,10,1,T2,,yup we did it,45:41.0,45:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
783,10,1,T2,,I don't think we really have to write it out,45:43.0,45:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
784,10,1,T2,,pause filler let's do let's write that out,45:44.0,45:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
785,10,1,T2,,negative twenty-nine equals pause filler k oh well,45:47.0,45:55.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
786,10,1,T2,,,45:55.0,49:17.0,03:22.0,,,,,,
787,10,1,T2,,okay are you on page four,45:55.0,45:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
788,10,1,T2,yup,,45:59.0,45:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
789,10,1,T2,,okay so this is like very similar so last time when we want the variables on one side last time when they were on two sides,45:59.0,46:16.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
790,10,1,T2,,do you remember what we did,46:16.0,46:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
791,10,1,T2,yeah,,46:18.0,46:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
792,10,1,T2,,yeah so do you want me to write it,46:19.0,46:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
793,10,1,T2,yeah you're better at writing it I'm not good,,46:23.0,46:26.0,00:03.0,,,,LPA,,
794,10,1,T2,,okay so what shall we do first,46:26.0,46:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
795,10,1,T2,we get rid of the p,,46:31.0,46:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
796,10,1,T2,,yeah by canceling it out adding b but what we do to one side we have to do it to the next,46:33.0,46:41.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
797,10,1,T2,so b plus b equals b (laughter),,46:41.0,46:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
798,10,1,T2,,so let's just pause filler write it out again over here,46:44.0,46:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
799,10,1,T2,,so seven seventeen sorry equals eighteen plus two b,46:50.0,47:04.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
800,10,1,T2,would b we're getting rid off because this one the seventeen minus b,,47:04.0,47:10.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
801,10,1,T2,that one could stay but the thirteen plus b,,47:10.0,47:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
802,10,1,T2,I think we should get rid of that one,,47:12.0,47:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
803,10,1,T2,,well you could it either way,47:15.0,47:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
804,10,1,T2,,I think you could pause filler,47:16.0,47:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
805,10,1,T2,,actually I don't think you could do it either way,47:18.0,47:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
806,10,1,T2,,because we need to trans like I guess,47:21.0,47:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
807,10,1,T2,I got it I got it on my mind,,47:27.0,47:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
808,10,1,T2,,it's really hard to explain if you want it,47:29.0,47:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
809,10,1,T2,,I don't think you could keep the minus b,47:32.0,47:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
810,10,1,T2,,because if you want it to minus that one if you want to do to minus b minus b you just be locked with like negative b,47:35.0,47:44.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
811,10,1,T2,,I don't really know I don't think it works so,47:44.0,47:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
812,10,1,T2,I guess I have to go two time two or we never mind,,47:49.0,47:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
813,10,1,T2,we have to get rid of thirteen so,,47:54.0,47:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
814,10,1,T2,,yeah you can do whatever first,47:58.0,48:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
815,10,1,T2,thirteen minus thirteen equals zero,,48:00.0,48:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
816,10,1,T2,seventeen minus thirteen equals four so,,48:03.0,48:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
817,10,1,T2,,so let's get I don't know why,48:06.0,48:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
818,10,1,T2,,I like to scribble this out but just so,48:07.0,48:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
819,10,1,T2,,what did you say four,48:12.0,48:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
820,10,1,T2,yeah four because three plus four equals thirteen,,48:15.0,48:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
821,10,1,T2,I don't know,,48:20.0,48:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
822,10,1,T2,,minus thirteen equals four,48:24.0,48:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
823,10,1,T2,,I'm just going to rewrite this because yeah okay,48:27.0,48:38.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
824,10,1,T2,,so here's what we have left,48:38.0,48:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
825,10,1,T2,well so we must be going four divide it,,48:40.0,48:46.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
826,10,1,T2,because two times b equals four,,48:46.0,48:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
827,10,1,T2,so we go four divided by two,,48:49.0,48:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
828,10,1,T2,it would be two,,48:51.0,48:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
829,10,1,T2,,yeah so,48:53.0,48:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
830,10,1,T2,so two equals b,,48:55.0,48:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
831,10,1,T2,,yup b equals two,48:56.0,49:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
832,10,1,T2,,that's not a two,49:00.0,49:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
833,10,1,T2,that's an eight,,49:01.0,49:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
834,10,1,T2,,that's now it's kind of a two,49:03.0,49:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
835,10,1,T2,,I don't know,49:05.0,49:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
836,10,1,T2,,I draw away in twos you know what whatever,49:06.0,49:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
837,10,1,T2,,you can see it like above it that,49:09.0,49:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
838,10,1,T2,,it's four,49:12.0,49:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
839,10,1,T2,it's on recording (laughter),,49:13.0,49:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
840,10,1,T2,,yeah we're saying it,49:14.0,49:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
841,10,1,T2,,,49:17.0,50:18.0,01:01.0,,,,,,
842,10,1,T2,minus nine it (inaudible) so,,49:17.0,49:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
843,10,1,T2,,this thing is easier I think,49:20.0,49:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
844,10,1,T2,yeah,,49:23.0,49:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
845,10,1,T2,,yeah this is easier,49:24.0,49:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
846,10,1,T2,so one divided by nine,,49:25.0,49:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
847,10,1,T2,,I think it's only one step mm-hmm,49:27.0,49:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
848,10,1,T2,,so divided by but you would divide it by negative nine right,49:30.0,49:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
849,10,1,T2,yeah but,,49:35.0,49:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
850,10,1,T2,,yeah negative nine pause filler,49:36.0,49:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
851,10,1,T2,well can you go negative nine that's all,,49:38.0,49:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
852,10,1,T2,that is just add minus nine,,49:40.0,49:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
853,10,1,T2,so nine times nine would equal eighty-one,,49:52.0,49:59.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
854,10,1,T2,so nine divided by nine or eighty-one divided by nine would be nine,,49:59.0,50:06.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
855,10,1,T2,,okay,50:07.0,50:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
856,10,1,T2,or minus nine (laughter) in this case,,50:08.0,50:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
857,10,1,T2,,yeah right we would add the minus,50:10.0,50:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
858,10,1,T2,,okay that was quick good job,50:15.0,50:18.0,00:03.0,,,UL,,,
859,10,1,T2,,,50:18.0,51:18.0,01:00.0,,,,,,
860,10,1,T2,okay okay,,50:18.0,50:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
861,10,1,T2,,this one's longer,50:19.0,50:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
862,10,1,T2,man,,50:22.0,50:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
863,10,1,T2,,okay so now we do no,50:23.0,50:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
864,10,1,T2,,all right the variable is still on one side,50:25.0,50:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
865,10,1,T2,yeah,,50:30.0,50:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
866,10,1,T2,,oh okay,50:31.0,50:31.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
867,10,1,T2,so we get rid of the ten,,50:32.0,50:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
868,10,1,T2,so ten minus ten equals zero,,50:35.0,50:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
869,10,1,T2,eighty-two minus ten equals seventy-two,,50:37.0,50:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
870,10,1,T2,,okay so we have seventy-two equals negative eight y,50:41.0,50:53.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
871,10,1,T2,so now we'd be getting rid of the negative eight,,50:55.0,50:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
872,10,1,T2,,pause filler yes,50:59.0,50:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
873,10,1,T2,so negative eight equal or negative eight plus eight equals zero,,51:00.0,51:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
874,10,1,T2,so seventy-two plus eight equals eighty,,51:04.0,51:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
875,10,1,T2,,all right so y equals eighty,51:08.0,51:17.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
876,10,1,T2,,okay you're much better at this than me,51:19.0,51:22.0,00:03.0,,,LPA,,,
877,10,1,T2,I just do it all in my mind,,51:23.0,51:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
878,10,1,T2,,yeah,51:25.0,51:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
879,10,1,T2,for some reason I'm good at doing it less than explaining what happened,,51:26.0,51:33.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
880,10,1,T2,,yeah I just didn't know,51:34.0,51:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
881,10,1,T2,,like when you were tutoring me I didn't know if I just do the work,51:35.0,51:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
882,10,1,T2,,or you just do the work,51:39.0,51:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
883,10,1,T2,,it was confusing (laughter) okay,51:39.0,51:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
884,10,1,T2,so we'd have to get rid of the sixty-five first here,,51:40.0,51:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
885,10,1,T2,,,51:40.0,54:03.0,02:23.0,,,,,,
886,10,1,T2,,okay and that's being subtracted which means (inaudible),51:44.0,51:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
887,10,1,T2,sixty-five minus sixty-five will equals zero,,51:48.0,51:55.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
888,10,1,T2,than a hundred and seven minus sixty-five would equal pause filler,,51:55.0,52:07.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
889,10,1,T2,,wouldn't that be like thirty-five,52:07.0,52:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
890,10,1,T2,I think it's sixty-two,,52:08.0,52:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
891,10,1,T2,let me check here,,52:11.0,52:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
892,10,1,T2,,well I'm recently doing like take the seven off real quick you do pause filler one hundred minus sixty-five,52:12.0,52:21.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
893,10,1,T2,,it's easy to do,52:21.0,52:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
894,10,1,T2,sixty-two plus sixty-five that's not a five,,52:21.0,52:29.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
895,10,1,T2,I'm writing on sixty-two plus sixty-five,,52:29.0,52:35.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
896,10,1,T2,so no that won't be it nope (laughter),,52:36.0,52:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
897,10,1,T2,this could be a hundred and twenty nope,,52:39.0,52:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
898,10,1,T2,,so a hundred minus sixty-five,52:45.0,52:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
899,10,1,T2,one over seven six five two bye-bye (inaudible) forty-two so forty-two,,52:47.0,53:03.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
900,10,1,T2,,forty-two okay I'm trying to get it six to go away go away,53:03.0,53:10.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
901,10,1,T2,,there we go okay so you said forty-two,53:10.0,53:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
902,10,1,T2,,let's leave this with forty-two equals,53:15.0,53:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
903,10,1,T2,fourteen x minus fourteen x okay I think it's just fourteen x,,53:18.0,53:22.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
904,10,1,T2,,well yeah it's just fourteen x,53:22.0,53:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
905,10,1,T2,,because we already get with the minus,53:24.0,53:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
906,10,1,T2,so fourteen x or fourteen minus fourteen so forty-two minus fourteen so I'll try to figure out,,53:26.0,53:37.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
907,10,1,T2,,yeah,53:37.0,53:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
908,10,1,T2,twenty-eight,,53:38.0,53:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
909,10,1,T2,twenty-eight,,53:45.0,53:45.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
910,10,1,T2,hmm,,53:45.0,53:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
911,10,1,T2,,okay,53:46.0,53:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
912,10,1,T2,I think (laughter) twenty-eight yeah twenty-eight,,53:46.0,53:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
913,10,1,T2,,okay,53:49.0,53:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
914,10,1,T2,why do I do this (inaudible),,53:50.0,53:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
915,10,1,T2,,see you're much better at computation,53:51.0,53:54.0,00:03.0,,,LPA,,,
916,10,1,T2,,and I'm so slow at it,53:54.0,53:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

1080,10,2,S1 ,yeah I'm pretty slow at it (laughter),,07:18.0,07:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,SD,
1081,10,2,S1 ,,but it's better than my handwriting,07:21.0,07:26.0,00:05.0,,,,LPP,,SD
1082,10,2,S1 ,,and everything is all perfect,07:26.0,07:27.0,00:01.0,,,,LPP,,
1083,10,2,S1 ,,so I would prefer than to writing on paper,07:27.0,07:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,SD
1084,10,2,S1 ,,okay,07:50.0,07:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1085,10,2,S1 ,,wait what (inaudible),07:53.0,07:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1086,10,2,S1 ,,we have twenty minutes all the way,08:19.0,08:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1087,10,2,S1 ,,because we have two different times,08:23.0,08:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1088,10,2,S1 ,,we're trying to figure out which one is correct,08:26.0,08:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1089,10,2,S1 ,that's mine,,08:30.0,08:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1090,10,2,S1 ,,I got eight ��_��_��_o seven,08:30.0,08:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1091,10,2,S1 ,well what did I say eight ��_��_��_o seven,,08:32.0,08:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1092,10,2,S1 ,yeah,,08:36.0,08:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1093,10,2,S1 ,,very,08:38.0,08:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1094,10,2,S1 ,,just ask me for the time,08:41.0,08:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1095,10,2,S1 ,,and I'll tell you what's the time,08:43.0,08:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1096,10,2,T1 ,,,08:52.0,23:34.0,14:42.0,,,,,,
1097,10,2,T1 ,,oh twenty minutes really,08:52.0,08:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1098,10,2,T1 ,I know right I know (inaudible),,08:55.0,08:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1099,10,2,T1 ,,,08:57.0,20:47.0,11:50.0,,,,,,
1100,10,2,T1 ,,okay so this isn't anything new I don't think,08:58.0,09:04.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1101,10,2,T1 ,nope,,09:05.0,09:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1102,10,2,T1 ,,I'm going to draw the line,09:06.0,09:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1103,10,2,T1 ,,because that helps me for some reason,09:07.0,09:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1104,10,2,T1 ,,I'm guessing I'm supposed to subtract x,09:10.0,09:17.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1105,10,2,T1 ,,because that's what the papers were saying,09:17.0,09:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1106,10,2,T1 ,,is that correct because no,09:21.0,09:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1107,10,2,T1 ,,no I'm supposed to divide x,09:24.0,09:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1108,10,2,T1 ,,I'm not sure one minute,09:26.0,09:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1109,10,2,T1 ,,let me think pause filler yeah yeah,09:28.0,09:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1110,10,2,T1 ,,and just make this forty over x,09:37.0,09:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1111,10,2,T1 ,cool,,09:41.0,09:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1112,10,2,T1 ,,okay this might be right,09:43.0,09:50.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1113,10,2,T1 ,,so then if I did that I have eight over seven equals forty oops,09:50.0,10:01.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
1114,10,2,T1 ,,oops I clicked the find okay,10:01.0,10:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1115,10,2,T1 ,not that button,,10:05.0,10:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1116,10,2,T1 ,,I wish it was red,10:07.0,10:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1117,10,2,T1 ,,and then it can say don't click the red button,10:09.0,10:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1118,10,2,T1 ,,okay does that make any sense I think,10:14.0,10:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1119,10,2,T1 ,I think so,,10:20.0,10:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1120,10,2,T1 ,,I think,10:21.0,10:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1121,10,2,T1 ,pause filler maybe we're using cross products,,10:22.0,10:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1122,10,2,T1 ,where like it go seven times forty and three times x equals,,10:25.0,10:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1123,10,2,T1 ,,oh you could do that or you could just,10:29.0,10:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1124,10,2,T1 ,,I think I did that wrong,10:35.0,10:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1125,10,2,T1 ,,what do you think,10:37.0,10:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1126,10,2,T1 ,,because I think I did that wrong,10:37.0,10:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1127,10,2,T1 ,pause filler when I learned it it was set up this way,,10:39.0,10:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1128,10,2,T1 ,but we used cross products,,10:42.0,10:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1129,10,2,T1 ,so it would be forty times seven and forty times x,,10:43.0,10:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1130,10,2,T1 ,,okay,10:47.0,10:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1131,10,2,T1 ,but it's not about how I learned it so no promises (laughter),,10:47.0,10:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1132,10,2,T1 ,,so forty times does that mean just got to cross that out,10:52.0,11:09.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
1133,10,2,T1 ,or maybe we're supposed to multiply both the sides by the thing worth writing so like three seven times three seven and forty time three seventh,,11:10.0,11:20.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
1134,10,2,T1 ,,yeah that might make sense,11:20.0,11:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1135,10,2,T1 ,,but like that's doing the same thing right,11:22.0,11:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1136,10,2,T1 ,yeah pretty much,,11:26.0,11:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1137,10,2,T1 ,,okay I'm going to try this so forty times seven,11:27.0,11:35.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1138,10,2,T1 ,,how come I don't have that memorized,11:35.0,11:52.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
1139,10,2,T1 ,I don't know,,11:52.0,11:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1140,10,2,T1 ,,let's do it in my head,11:53.0,11:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1141,10,2,T1 ,,would that be two hundred and eighty,11:55.0,12:02.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1142,10,2,T1 ,,that's what I got,12:02.0,12:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1143,10,2,T1 ,yeah two eighty,,12:03.0,12:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1144,10,2,T1 ,,two eighty that way right that's the top or the bottom,12:04.0,12:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1145,10,2,T1 ,,I think that's the top,12:07.0,12:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1146,10,2,T1 ,top because forty times seven,,12:08.0,12:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1147,10,2,T1 ,,yeah over a three x then,12:10.0,12:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1148,10,2,T1 ,yeah,,12:13.0,12:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1149,10,2,T1 ,,and then I'm confused,12:13.0,12:23.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
1150,10,2,T1 ,,because it's supposed to say like in the format of this equals like constant constant constant equals variable or something like that,12:24.0,12:42.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
1151,10,2,T1 ,,so now it's just fraction,12:43.0,12:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1152,10,2,T1 ,,oh well I'll see,12:46.0,12:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1153,10,2,T1 ,,maybe I'll get the right answer and just be doing it the wrong way,12:49.0,12:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1154,10,2,T1 ,,so try to get rid of yeah see,12:52.0,13:00.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1155,10,2,T1 ,,now this is all messed up,13:00.0,13:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1156,10,2,T1 ,I'm looking at it,,13:03.0,13:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1157,10,2,T1 ,I'm not quite sure,,13:08.0,13:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1158,10,2,T1 ,I never learned about this one,,13:12.0,13:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1159,10,2,T1 ,,yeah okay maybe I should try it a different way,13:13.0,13:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1160,10,2,T1 ,,and then if it doesn't work I'll come back to it,13:18.0,13:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1161,10,2,T1 ,it sounds like a hundred equals the fraction with a number (inaudible),,13:21.0,13:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1162,10,2,T1 ,so it says to go like first,,13:26.0,13:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1163,10,2,T1 ,it would be forty times thirty-seven,,13:28.0,13:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1164,10,2,T1 ,and then that's the answer,,13:31.0,13:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1165,10,2,T1 ,,forty times what,13:34.0,13:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1166,10,2,T1 ,thirty-seven so,,13:37.0,13:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1167,10,2,T1 ,,okay how would you do that,13:41.0,13:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1168,10,2,T1 ,I think we might have to set up a forty as a fraction,,13:43.0,13:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1169,10,2,T1 ,so maybe we could put it over one forty over one times,,13:47.0,13:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1170,10,2,T1 ,,yeah that makes sense,13:53.0,13:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1171,10,2,T1 ,yeah,,13:55.0,13:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1172,10,2,T1 ,,three that's a bad three,13:55.0,13:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1173,10,2,T1 ,,but at least I know it's a three,13:56.0,13:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1174,10,2,T1 ,yeah it's a three (laughter),,13:58.0,13:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1175,10,2,T1 ,,okay times forty over one,13:59.0,14:13.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
1176,10,2,T1 ,so let me find the common denominator and all that,,14:13.0,14:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1177,10,2,T1 ,,or wait can I just do this no can I no,14:17.0,14:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1178,10,2,T1 ,,I think kind of multiplying,14:19.0,14:27.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1179,10,2,T1 ,,can you just go straight across,14:27.0,14:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1180,10,2,T1 ,I think so yeah,,14:29.0,14:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1181,10,2,T1 ,,yeah it's adding and subtracting,14:30.0,14:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1182,10,2,T1 ,,but you have to find the common denominator I think,14:33.0,14:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1183,10,2,T1 ,yeah I think so,,14:39.0,14:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1184,10,2,T1 ,I'm not sure,,14:42.0,14:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1185,10,2,T1 ,it looks so weird (laughter),,14:43.0,14:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1186,10,2,T1 ,this is like yeah,,14:45.0,14:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1187,10,2,T1 ,,(inaudible) so it would be one twenty,14:46.0,14:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1188,10,2,T1 ,one twenty over one or one twenty and ten also I think we got it (laughter),,14:50.0,14:56.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1189,10,2,T1 ,,yeah so we have one twenty over seven,14:56.0,15:01.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1190,10,2,T1 ,,we do have to simplify that over one or wait divide it,15:01.0,15:09.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1191,10,2,T1 ,one twenty divided by seven,,15:09.0,15:17.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1192,10,2,T1 ,,seven goes into twelve one time,15:17.0,15:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1193,10,2,T1 ,,one times seven is seven minus,15:22.0,15:38.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
1194,10,2,T1 ,,wait I'm confused now yeah okay yeah and then,15:38.0,15:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1195,10,2,T1 ,,I haven't done long division too long too long spent long so five,15:40.0,16:16.0,00:36.0,,,,,,
1196,10,2,T1 ,,I'm sorry,16:16.0,16:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1197,10,2,T1 ,,I'm just like blanking out having a brain fart,16:17.0,16:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1198,10,2,T1 ,me too,,16:20.0,16:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1199,10,2,T1 ,,okay so pause filler minus five oh yeah wait do seven times five oh yeah seven divide,16:21.0,16:35.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
1200,10,2,T1 ,,don't cancel you bring down zero right,16:35.0,16:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1201,10,2,T1 ,,I didn't see how many times seven goes into fifty,16:39.0,16:50.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
1202,10,2,T1 ,yeah yeah,,16:50.0,16:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1203,10,2,T1 ,,okay it's coming back,16:50.0,16:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1204,10,2,T1 ,,seven goes into fifty oh seven goes into fifty seventy twenty-eight twenty-eight,16:52.0,17:29.0,00:37.0,,,,,,
1205,10,2,T1 ,oh my god it's going to be long (laughter) forty,,17:29.0,17:43.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
1206,10,2,T1 ,,forty-two okay pause filler forty-two forty-nine is one two three four five six seven,17:43.0,17:50.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1207,10,2,T1 ,,I got seven times and forty-nine right,17:50.0,17:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1208,10,2,T1 ,yeah yeah,,17:53.0,17:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1209,10,2,T1 ,,okay so seven goes and fifty seven times seven,17:54.0,17:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1210,10,2,T1 ,how did you get,,17:58.0,17:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1211,10,2,T1 ,wait you have forty-nine,,17:59.0,18:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1212,10,2,T1 ,,huh,18:00.0,18:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1213,10,2,T1 ,because it will go,,18:01.0,18:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1214,10,2,T1 ,,it goes into seven,18:02.0,18:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1215,10,2,T1 ,,oh wait seven goes and fifty pause filler seven times,18:04.0,18:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1216,10,2,T1 ,because with the seven fourteen twenty-one twenty-eight thirty-two or no no nothing I can remember,,18:07.0,18:15.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1217,10,2,T1 ,no you're right (laughter),,18:15.0,18:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1218,10,2,T1 ,I messed up my mind,,18:17.0,18:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1219,10,2,T1 ,,oh no can I scroll down or something,18:20.0,18:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1220,10,2,T1 ,,I guess not fifty oh well forty-nine,18:22.0,18:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1221,10,2,T1 ,we'll just go one twenty over seven (laughter),,18:27.0,18:33.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1222,10,2,T1 ,,yeah can I scroll down for a while,18:33.0,18:38.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1223,10,2,T1 ,,I'll just do up to this side,18:38.0,18:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1224,10,2,T1 ,yeah,,18:42.0,18:42.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1225,10,2,T1 ,,fifty minus nine is one,18:42.0,18:51.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
1226,10,2,T1 ,,and what do you do,18:51.0,18:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1227,10,2,T1 ,,can I just say r one,18:53.0,18:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1228,10,2,T1 ,then you get a one,,18:57.0,18:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1229,10,2,T1 ,and then you'd get another zero,,18:57.0,18:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1230,10,2,T1 ,so you get ten one time,,18:59.0,19:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1231,10,2,T1 ,,so ten okay,19:02.0,19:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1232,10,2,T1 ,this is a repeating process,,19:04.0,19:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1233,10,2,T1 ,,I really need to scroll down scrolling,19:05.0,19:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1234,10,2,T1 ,,there's a setting that says scrolling,19:08.0,19:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1235,10,2,T1 ,this will just be pretty much,,19:09.0,19:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1236,10,2,T1 ,but this will pretty much just be a repeating thing,,19:12.0,19:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1237,10,2,T1 ,,yeah right one repeating seventeen,19:15.0,19:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1238,10,2,T1 ,so seventeen what's seventeen seventeen seventeen,,19:18.0,19:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1239,10,2,T1 ,,yeah,19:21.0,19:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1240,10,2,T1 ,so it will be a long decimal,,19:21.0,19:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1241,10,2,T1 ,so just say seven,,19:22.0,19:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1242,10,2,T1 ,,fifteen point one repeated right,19:23.0,19:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1243,10,2,T1 ,yeah,,19:26.0,19:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1244,10,2,T1 ,,one repeated so what was it,19:27.0,19:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1245,10,2,T1 ,,the variable x equals pause filler seventeen point one p,19:31.0,19:48.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
1246,10,2,T1 ,,encircle it so people know that's the very answer,19:48.0,19:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1247,10,2,T1 ,,because everything else is a mess,19:51.0,19:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1248,10,2,T1 ,yeah,,19:55.0,19:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1249,10,2,T1 ,,that's it forever,19:56.0,19:56.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1250,10,2,T1 ,,I'm sorry,19:56.0,19:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1251,10,2,T1 ,next to go,,19:57.0,19:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1252,10,2,T1 ,,finally again this is like same thing,19:59.0,20:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1253,10,2,T1 ,,this wasn't on the paper,20:03.0,20:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1254,10,2,T1 ,,this was on the paper,20:05.0,20:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1255,10,2,T1 ,,I think it was on paper now,20:06.0,20:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1256,10,2,T1 ,,it just didn't get far enough,20:07.0,20:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1257,10,2,T1 ,,okay yeah except I don't have a paper,20:09.0,20:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1258,10,2,T1 ,,okay so what does it say to do,20:14.0,20:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1259,10,2,T1 ,it says this one is a hundred equals two over three y,,20:17.0,20:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1260,10,2,T1 ,so it says multiply both sides by three over two,,20:24.0,20:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1261,10,2,T1 ,and then it gets a hundred and fifty,,20:28.0,20:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1262,10,2,T1 ,,so multiply oh yeah that makes sense now okay,20:31.0,20:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1263,10,2,T1 ,,because you're trying to get k,20:34.0,20:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1264,10,2,T1 ,,so we'll multiply why side by three over eight,20:37.0,20:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1265,10,2,T1 ,because three over eight times three over eight we'll cross cancel that out so fourteen time three over eight,,20:40.0,20:46.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1266,10,2,T1 ,,so here I just got k and then oh three over eight and the answer,20:47.0,20:55.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1267,10,2,T1 ,,,20:47.0,23:34.0,02:47.0,,,,,,
1268,10,2,T1 ,,this has been a b equal to k times fourteen over one equals,20:55.0,21:08.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
1269,10,2,T1 ,maybe I guess a lowest common denominator thing,,21:08.0,21:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1270,10,2,T1 ,,maybe or you just got to like divide or something,21:10.0,21:16.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1271,10,2,T1 ,because one could go into eight pretty easily,,21:16.0,21:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1272,10,2,T1 ,so eight would be the lowest common denominator,,21:19.0,21:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1273,10,2,T1 ,so it would be three over eight times fourteen over eight (inaudible),,21:21.0,21:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1274,10,2,T1 ,,okay three times fourteen twenty-eight thirty-two oh,21:27.0,21:34.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1275,10,2,T1 ,yeah,,21:34.0,21:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1276,10,2,T1 ,,yeah,21:34.0,21:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1277,10,2,T1 ,I think so,,21:34.0,21:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1278,10,2,T1 ,so let me let me just check it,,21:37.0,21:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1279,10,2,T1 ,,okay I don't know why there's weird dots,21:41.0,21:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1280,10,2,T1 ,,yeah I don't know why but okay,21:45.0,21:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1281,10,2,T1 ,I don't know,,21:49.0,21:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1282,10,2,T1 ,,okay I'm going to start y up here,21:49.0,21:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1283,10,2,T1 ,in forty-two,,21:53.0,21:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1284,10,2,T1 ,,forty or thirty,21:55.0,21:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1285,10,2,T1 ,forty-two because it will be four plus four plus four equals twelve,,21:56.0,22:01.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1286,10,2,T1 ,so you carry a one,,22:01.0,22:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1287,10,2,T1 ,,what's forty-two over eight,22:02.0,22:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1288,10,2,T1 ,yeah,,22:07.0,22:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1289,10,2,T1 ,,okay,22:07.0,22:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1290,10,2,T1 ,so then eight would go into forty-two,,22:07.0,22:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1291,10,2,T1 ,,okay wait now that's I set this up wrong,22:10.0,22:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1292,10,2,T1 ,,eight goes into forty-two what did you,22:12.0,22:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1293,10,2,T1 ,you go first,,22:13.0,22:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1294,10,2,T1 ,,oh I was going to ask if you bother anything,22:14.0,22:29.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
1295,10,2,T1 ,,because I'm still working on it,22:29.0,22:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1296,10,2,T1 ,so eight and eight equals sixteen,,22:32.0,22:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1297,10,2,T1 ,sixteen plus eight equals twenty-four,,22:34.0,22:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1298,10,2,T1 ,twenty-four plus eight equals thirty-two,,22:39.0,22:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1299,10,2,T1 ,so then thirty-two plus eight equals forty,,22:42.0,22:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1300,10,2,T1 ,so you can get the forty,,22:44.0,22:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1301,10,2,T1 ,,okay,22:47.0,22:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1302,10,2,T1 ,so then it would be five times,,22:47.0,22:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1303,10,2,T1 ,,five times,22:49.0,22:56.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1304,10,2,T1 ,(laughter) I have no idea what to talk about,,22:56.0,23:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1305,10,2,T1 ,,me neither wait what's the surgery called again,23:01.0,23:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1306,10,2,T1 ,,I didn't hear you the first time,23:03.0,23:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1307,10,2,T1 ,I don't know what's it called,,23:04.0,23:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1308,10,2,T1 ,I guess that is called oral surgery,,23:07.0,23:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1309,10,2,T1 ,because that's what it's considered,,23:09.0,23:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1310,10,2,T1 ,,oh well like are they going to numb it,23:12.0,23:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1311,10,2,T1 ,I'm not sure,,23:14.0,23:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1312,10,2,T1 ,,I hope they do (inaudible),23:16.0,23:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1313,10,2,T1 ,two (inaudible) are cutting into me,,23:18.0,24:57.0,01:39.0,,,,,,
1314,10,2,S2 ,,,24:49.0,28:57.0,04:08.0,,,,,,
1315,10,2,S2 ,,yeah they possibly will,24:58.0,25:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1316,10,2,S2 ,because my teeth are connected to the bones,,25:00.0,25:07.0,00:07.0,,,,,,SD

1321,10,2,S2 ,,I'm sure they'll do it in a much more sophisticated way,25:31.0,25:36.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1322,10,2,S2 ,so I hope they don't just make me breath in the mask,,25:36.0,25:43.0,00:07.0,,,,,,SD
1323,10,2,S2 ,oh that scares me,,25:43.0,25:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,SD

1328,10,2,S2 ,yes because I am terrified with needles and feeling of walking your surroundings with spade in and out so scary,,25:59.0,26:08.0,00:09.0,,,,,,SD
1329,10,2,S2 ,I'd rather wave in the head,,26:08.0,26:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,SD
1330,10,2,S2 ,,just close your eyes,26:09.0,26:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

1436,10,2,T2 ,,so you could do one times one,33:22.0,33:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1437,10,2,T2 ,,I think but either way,33:27.0,33:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1438,10,2,T2 ,,I think you set the answer,33:31.0,33:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1439,10,2,T2 ,one times one it is,,33:32.0,33:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

1444,10,2,T2 ,,and you can check and see if you get the same answer if you pause filler do the fractions,33:43.0,33:49.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1445,10,2,T2 ,,oh my god,33:49.0,33:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,

1453,10,2,T2 ,it's a long (inaudible) one times negative the other number so twenty-five pause filler the horrible thumb,,34:18.0,34:32.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
1454,10,2,T2 ,,yay okay that was fast,34:33.0,34:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

1467,10,2,T2 ,,you get rid of seventeen like,35:19.0,35:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1468,10,2,T2 ,,so make negative seventeen and zero,35:21.0,35:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1469,10,2,T2 ,,you have to add something to it,35:26.0,35:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

1560,10,2,T2 ,we then shift,,41:17.0,41:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1561,10,2,T2 ,it says fifty-two,,41:22.0,41:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1562,10,2,T2 ,goodbye fifty-four you will not be (inaudible),,41:26.0,41:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1563,10,2,T2 ,,so now that's,41:28.0,41:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1564,10,2,T2 ,so now I get rid of four,,41:30.0,41:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1565,10,2,T2 ,,yeah I'm just going to rewrite it four over k,41:32.0,41:42.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
1566,10,2,T2 ,,oh my gosh maybe I should not (inaudible) to this oh well equals,41:42.0,41:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1567,10,2,T2 ,,so it's not good sixty,41:49.0,41:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1568,10,2,T2 ,,I'm going to go slow,41:51.0,41:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1569,10,2,T2 ,,but I don't think it's working two,41:54.0,41:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1570,10,2,T2 ,,oh well so they get rid of the four,41:57.0,42:03.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1571,10,2,T2 ,,that doesn't look like a four,42:03.0,42:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1572,10,2,T2 ,,it kind of looks like,42:05.0,42:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1573,10,2,T2 ,,it kind of looks like this for some reason but like tilted,42:06.0,42:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1574,10,2,T2 ,looks like a nine with a thing around four,,42:12.0,42:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1575,10,2,T2 ,,yeah okay to get rid of the four two times four,42:16.0,42:23.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1576,10,2,T2 ,or no because it's not a minus four,,42:23.0,42:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1577,10,2,T2 ,it's a four times four will be six,,42:28.0,42:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1578,10,2,T2 ,and twelve four times four wouldn't be zero,,42:31.0,42:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1579,10,2,T2 ,,right right,42:34.0,42:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1580,10,2,T2 ,so you have to divide it this time,,42:34.0,42:40.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1581,10,2,T2 ,,divide it pause filler maybe,42:40.0,42:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1582,10,2,T2 ,,wait four is being divided by k,42:42.0,42:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1583,10,2,T2 ,nah what did I write,,42:46.0,42:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1584,10,2,T2 ,I didn't even write a seven,,42:50.0,42:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1585,10,2,T2 ,go away seven,,42:53.0,42:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1586,10,2,T2 ,,and maybe you're right,42:55.0,42:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1587,10,2,T2 ,undo undo oh (laughter) the face is like an eight so four,,42:56.0,43:02.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1588,10,2,T2 ,it's like a four equals,,43:02.0,43:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1589,10,2,T2 ,we'll just say zero if not equals one,,43:04.0,43:08.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1590,10,2,T2 ,,you know,43:08.0,43:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1591,10,2,T2 ,but one can go leave throughout the door goodbye jump out of window on,,43:09.0,43:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1592,10,2,T2 ,,I think it just matters is,43:13.0,43:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1593,10,2,T2 ,,it doesn't really matter like what you get on this side,43:15.0,43:21.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1594,10,2,T2 ,,like does it really matter what you get on more side,43:22.0,43:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1595,10,2,T2 ,,it just like matters what admiration yeah,43:23.0,43:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1596,10,2,T2 ,six,,43:28.0,43:28.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1597,10,2,T2 ,,oh I'm sorry,43:29.0,43:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1598,10,2,T2 ,,I'm trying to,43:29.0,43:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1599,10,2,T2 ,,I'm sorry,43:30.0,43:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1600,10,2,T2 ,,I was going to be,43:30.0,43:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1601,10,2,T2 ,it's fine,,43:31.0,43:31.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1602,10,2,T2 ,,I was like trying to reverse my arrow,43:31.0,43:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1603,10,2,T2 ,,and you were trying to divide it the same time,43:34.0,43:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1604,10,2,T2 ,,I was trying to erase,43:39.0,43:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1605,10,2,T2 ,kind of planning this stuff (laughter) so then stop,,43:41.0,43:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1606,10,2,T2 ,I don't want the settings,,43:45.0,43:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1607,10,2,T2 ,,yeah maybe you're pushing the button,43:47.0,43:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1608,10,2,T2 ,no when you press two card for too long it immediately pops up,,43:50.0,43:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1609,10,2,T2 ,,oh okay,43:55.0,43:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1610,10,2,T2 ,so one minus that,,43:56.0,43:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1611,10,2,T2 ,,wait one second,43:59.0,44:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1612,10,2,T2 ,,I'm going to sign something might tell this,44:01.0,44:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1613,10,2,T2 ,so four oh (inaudible) scratch paper (laughter),,44:06.0,44:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1614,10,2,T2 ,,see okay well I have (inaudible),44:09.0,44:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1615,10,2,T2 ,,and it's two over x equals twenty,44:13.0,44:20.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1616,10,2,T2 ,,it says which is what we have right now,44:20.0,44:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1617,10,2,T2 ,,and this is multiply both sides by x,44:25.0,44:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1618,10,2,T2 ,oh no no,,44:30.0,44:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1619,10,2,T2 ,,so if you multiply,44:32.0,44:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1620,10,2,T2 ,,wait this is what we're supposed to do,44:35.0,44:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1621,10,2,T2 ,,so as you multiply both sides by x,44:37.0,44:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1622,10,2,T2 ,got it,,44:40.0,44:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1623,10,2,T2 ,,you got it,44:41.0,44:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1624,10,2,T2 ,yeah,,44:43.0,44:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1625,10,2,T2 ,,okay,44:43.0,44:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1626,10,2,T2 ,because it would be twenty,,44:43.0,44:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1627,10,2,T2 ,,because this thing is,44:45.0,44:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1628,10,2,T2 ,,I don't know if you're supposed to do that,44:47.0,44:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1629,10,2,T2 ,,because it's the same set of,44:50.0,44:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1630,10,2,T2 ,,its two over x equals twenty,44:52.0,44:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1631,10,2,T2 ,,and then it says multiply both sides by x (inaudible),44:55.0,44:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1632,10,2,T2 ,but we have the fifty-four to before the k plus fifty-four,,44:58.0,45:06.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1633,10,2,T2 ,,yeah but that's the equation like we have right now like in the green,45:06.0,45:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1634,10,2,T2 ,,so I don't know if that would tell,45:13.0,45:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1635,10,2,T2 ,,but technically we would follow the same steps and then,45:16.0,45:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1636,10,2,T2 ,oh that's okay,,45:20.0,45:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1637,10,2,T2 ,,okay so divided by x so then if we would divide it by k,45:23.0,45:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1638,10,2,T2 ,,you would just be left with,45:28.0,45:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1639,10,2,T2 ,,if we do it this way we would be left with,45:34.0,45:41.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1640,10,2,T2 ,,was that four,45:41.0,45:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1641,10,2,T2 ,there would be no remainder,,45:41.0,45:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1642,10,2,T2 ,there will be no remainder,,45:45.0,45:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1643,10,2,T2 ,,hmm,45:45.0,45:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1644,10,2,T2 ,,for that one okay I'm just going to real quick do it this way,45:48.0,45:57.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
1645,10,2,T2 ,,and see if you get the same answer,45:57.0,46:04.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1646,10,2,T2 ,well you see what I did,,46:04.0,46:11.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1647,10,2,T2 ,so (laughter) yeah let's break (laughter),,46:11.0,46:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1648,10,2,T2 ,,(inaudible) equals sixty-two k,46:14.0,46:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1649,10,2,T2 ,nice snails,,46:25.0,46:26.0,00:01.0,,,,LPP,,
1650,10,2,T2 ,,thanks I only did one hand,46:27.0,46:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1651,10,2,T2 ,nice,,46:29.0,46:30.0,00:01.0,,,,UL,,
1652,10,2,T2 ,,I was too lazy okay,46:30.0,46:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1653,10,2,T2 ,yeah that's me,,46:31.0,46:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1654,10,2,T2 ,,I know so divide both sides by twenty twenty sixty-two wait still worst sixty-two ever,46:33.0,46:57.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
1655,10,2,T2 ,,it says divide both sides by the number,46:57.0,47:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1656,10,2,T2 ,,and then we just (inaudible),47:03.0,47:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1657,10,2,T2 ,,that makes no sense,47:08.0,47:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1658,10,2,T2 ,,oh I guess that does,47:10.0,47:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1659,10,2,T2 ,,then I get four over sixty-two equals k,47:11.0,47:23.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
1660,10,2,T2 ,,and then you simplify the four over sixty-two by dividing it,47:23.0,47:31.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1661,10,2,T2 ,,which is what we did here,47:31.0,47:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1662,10,2,T2 ,,and you get one five five,47:33.0,47:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1663,10,2,T2 ,,so like we got the same answers,47:36.0,47:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1664,10,2,T2 ,,so this would be the answer,47:38.0,47:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1665,10,2,T2 ,,but we did it different ways,47:40.0,47:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1666,10,2,T2 ,yeah,,47:43.0,47:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1667,10,2,T2 ,,okay but I don't think it really matters at this point because,47:44.0,47:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1668,10,2,T2 ,(inaudible) (laughter) you made it a lot further last time,,47:49.0,47:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1669,10,2,T2 ,,huh,47:52.0,47:52.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1670,10,2,T2 ,you made it a lot further last time,,47:53.0,47:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1671,10,2,T2 ,,yeah okay negative I think,47:56.0,48:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1672,10,2,T2 ,,wait this is like,48:00.0,48:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1673,10,2,T2 ,,,48:00.0,48:22.0,00:22.0,,,,,,
1674,10,2,T2 ,,it's like a first one,48:03.0,48:09.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1675,10,2,T2 ,,but it's just the order is switched I think,48:09.0,48:15.0,00:06.0,,,,,,

1720,11,1,S1 ,,which middle school did you go to,02:34.0,02:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,QE
1721,11,1,S1 ,I pause filler did a program called Cyber School,,02:35.0,02:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,SD,
1722,11,1,S1 ,and pause filler it was just a tutoring school remotely from home,,02:38.0,02:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1723,11,1,S1 ,and pause filler using like computers,,02:42.0,02:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1724,11,1,S1 ,and going to like online classes,,02:45.0,02:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1725,11,1,S1 ,and learning so that yeah,,02:46.0,02:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1726,11,1,S1 ,,okay cool,02:49.0,02:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1727,11,1,S1 ,,would you say you know a lot about the algebra we're learning here,02:50.0,02:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,SD
1728,11,1,S1 ,pause filler I mean I don't really get them out so,,02:53.0,02:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,SD,
1729,11,1,S1 ,,yeah yeah yeah I suppose this probably works a little better with kids who are less knowledgeable about it,02:57.0,03:08.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
1730,11,1,S1 ,yes,,03:08.0,03:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1731,11,1,S1 ,but when it comes to advanced stuff I'm a little rusty on that but yeah,,03:08.0,03:13.0,00:05.0,,,,,SD,
1732,11,1,S1 ,,yeah I haven't really done algebra in a while,03:13.0,03:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,SD
1733,11,1,S1 ,,we're learning geometry this time of year pause filler,03:17.0,03:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,SD
1734,11,1,S1 ,nice,,03:22.0,03:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1735,11,1,S1 ,,yeah last year was our algebra thing,03:25.0,03:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,SD
1736,11,1,S1 ,,have you taken keystones yet,03:28.0,03:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,QE
1737,11,1,S1 ,pause filler last week pause filler one same Thursday I did the biology keystones,,03:31.0,03:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1738,11,1,S1 ,and that's was it so,,03:37.0,03:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1739,11,1,S1 ,,okay yeah our school as part of our math program we do the keystones,03:39.0,03:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1740,11,1,S1 ,,pause filler just before high school,03:46.0,03:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1741,11,1,S1 ,,so we don't have to deal with it then,03:49.0,03:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1742,11,1,S1 ,,just have to go through now,03:52.0,03:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1743,11,1,S1 ,that's good to get off your chest you know,,03:55.0,03:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1744,11,1,S1 ,,factoring polynomials is really the only thing that I've lost after that time,03:58.0,04:04.0,00:06.0,,,,,,SD
1745,11,1,S1 ,,and overall it doesn't make a lot of sense to me,04:04.0,04:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1746,11,1,S1 ,,I mean it make sense to me,04:07.0,04:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,SD
1747,11,1,S1 ,,but it doesn't seem like you would use it that much,04:08.0,04:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1748,11,1,S1 ,,as opposed to geometry and algebra where a lot more common,04:13.0,04:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1749,11,1,S1 ,,but factoring polynomials that's all like the stuff that doesn't really tangible,04:18.0,04:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1750,11,1,S1 ,mm-hmm yeah yeah,,04:24.0,04:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1751,11,1,S1 ,,is there like a verb for tangibleness,04:26.0,04:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1752,11,1,S1 ,,things don't tangenate,04:28.0,04:28.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

1761,11,1,S1 ,,I see pause filler half of it is pause filler you and me,04:56.0,04:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1762,11,1,S1 ,,and then the other half would be the desktop,04:59.0,05:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1763,11,1,S1 ,yup that's what I'm seeing,,05:03.0,05:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1764,11,1,S1 ,it's blue pause filler,,05:05.0,05:05.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1765,11,1,S1 ,,see anything interesting on the desktop,05:05.0,05:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1766,11,1,S1 ,pause filler not really,,05:10.0,05:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1767,11,1,S1 ,well there's Evernote,,05:11.0,05:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1768,11,1,S1 ,it's a program,,05:12.0,05:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1769,11,1,S1 ,,I see a batch file on the desktop,05:14.0,05:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1770,11,1,S1 ,,I wonder what it does,05:15.0,05:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1771,11,1,S1 ,pause filler let's see what else,,05:17.0,05:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1772,11,1,S1 ,that's it,,05:21.0,05:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1773,11,1,S1 ,I don't know,,05:22.0,05:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1774,11,1,S1 ,,does this work,05:23.0,05:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1775,11,1,S1 ,,well I can't really interact with this until I get the pens,05:24.0,05:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1776,11,1,S1 ,,so not a lot I can do until then,05:28.0,05:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1777,11,1,S1 ,seems very cool though,,05:31.0,05:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1778,11,1,S1 ,they're very yeah,,05:32.0,05:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1779,11,1,S1 ,,yeah have you seen the cool robotic face recognition program that just was there,05:33.0,05:41.0,00:08.0,,,,,,QE
1780,11,1,S1 ,pause filler no,,05:41.0,05:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1781,11,1,S1 ,I didn't get to see that,,05:42.0,05:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1782,11,1,S1 ,no,,05:44.0,05:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

1784,11,1,S1 ,,but there was like pause filler we were just my mom was showing me where she worked,05:47.0,05:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1785,11,1,S1 ,,pause filler and we classify like this face recognition pause filler robot thing,05:52.0,05:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1786,11,1,S1 ,,just recognized whether or not we are happy or sad or like making happy or sad face or,05:58.0,06:06.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1787,11,1,S1 ,,like a surprised face I guess was the third option,06:06.0,06:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1788,11,1,S1 ,that's very extraordinary wow,,06:08.0,06:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

1791,11,1,S1 ,,I wonder what we'll be able to do soon,06:15.0,06:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1792,11,1,S1 ,,and we'll be able to go to Mars,06:18.0,06:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1793,11,1,S1 ,,(inaudible),06:20.0,06:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1794,11,1,S1 ,yeah I feel like I'm in a kitchen right now because there's a microwave right on the table,,06:21.0,06:29.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1795,11,1,S1 ,and behind the computer is a fridge,,06:29.0,06:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1796,11,1,S1 ,and it's just a kitchen I guess,,06:32.0,06:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1797,11,1,S1 ,a sink with I don't know,,06:36.0,06:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1798,11,1,S1 ,I feel like I'm in the kitchen right now,,06:38.0,06:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1799,11,1,S1 ,,pause filler I am certainly in a presentation now,06:42.0,06:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1800,11,1,S1 ,,there is a projector on the ceiling,06:44.0,06:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1801,11,1,S1 ,,and I am surrounded by whiteboards,06:47.0,06:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1802,11,1,S1 ,,I mean we won't be able to see if there's a whiteboard that way,06:49.0,06:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1803,11,1,S1 ,,that way is the glass wall,06:53.0,06:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1804,11,1,S1 ,,but it's supposed to be whiteboard,06:55.0,06:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1805,11,1,S1 ,,and then behind me is whiteboard,06:56.0,06:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1806,11,1,S1 ,,and all that is whiteboard,06:57.0,06:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1807,11,1,S1 ,,and all this is whiteboard,06:58.0,07:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1808,11,1,S1 ,,and there's a projector over there,07:01.0,07:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1809,11,1,S1 ,,and pause filler oh yeah there is a microwave and a coffeemaker and a refrigerator,07:04.0,07:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1810,11,1,S1 ,nice,,07:11.0,07:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1811,11,1,S1 ,,yup,07:13.0,07:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1812,11,1,S1 ,did you have your day out,,07:14.0,07:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1813,11,1,S1 ,,I have all but forgotten what it was like to be outside today because I didn't pay attention,07:19.0,07:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,SD
1814,11,1,S1 ,,mostly I just walk inside,07:23.0,07:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1815,11,1,S1 ,,and pause filler now I'm here,07:26.0,07:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1816,11,1,S1 ,,I don't pay attention too much,07:29.0,07:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1817,11,1,S1 ,,it's kind of in the way,07:31.0,07:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1818,11,1,S1 ,okay,,07:34.0,07:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1819,11,1,S1 ,,and it looks like our thing is about to starty,07:35.0,07:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1820,11,1,S1 ,what is plain green text again,,08:15.0,08:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1821,11,1,S1 ,all right great,,08:26.0,08:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1822,11,1,S1 ,all right thanks,,08:33.0,08:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1823,11,1,T1 ,,,08:35.0,19:21.0,10:46.0,,,,,,
1824,11,1,T1 ,all right hi,,08:35.0,08:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1825,11,1,T1 ,are you ready to get this math started,,08:36.0,08:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,QE
1826,11,1,T1 ,,,08:40.0,09:40.0,01:00.0,,,,,,
1827,11,1,T1 ,all right all right so pause filler,,08:40.0,08:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1828,11,1,T1 ,,I'd probably be better if this was a mouse,08:44.0,08:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,SD
1829,11,1,T1 ,,let's see back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back,08:47.0,08:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1830,11,1,T1 ,,okay I'm ready,08:54.0,08:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,SD
1831,11,1,T1 ,all right so in this equation it looks like x our variable,,08:55.0,09:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1832,11,1,T1 ,oops that's,,09:01.0,09:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1833,11,1,T1 ,,yup that's the variable yup,09:02.0,09:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1834,11,1,T1 ,yup it's being subtracted by six and so just,,09:03.0,09:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1835,11,1,T1 ,,equals thirteen,09:07.0,09:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1836,11,1,T1 ,so yeah it equals thirteen so,,09:08.0,09:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1837,11,1,T1 ,,solve it because that also means if you add the six to both sides because that's how I do this,09:11.0,09:18.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1838,11,1,T1 ,,I got it,09:18.0,09:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,SD
1839,11,1,T1 ,,this is worse than writing on paper,09:19.0,09:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1840,11,1,T1 ,,and I'm bad at this,09:21.0,09:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,SD
1841,11,1,T1 ,,which means x equals thirteen plus,09:23.0,09:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1842,11,1,T1 ,,wait that's the point,09:27.0,09:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1843,11,1,T1 ,,six,09:29.0,09:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1844,11,1,T1 ,,which means x equals nineteen,09:30.0,09:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1845,11,1,T1 ,awesome,,09:34.0,09:35.0,00:01.0,,,UL,,,
1846,11,1,T1 ,yup it seems like it got it,,09:35.0,09:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1847,11,1,T1 ,all right and so I guess we clicked the arrow,,09:37.0,09:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1848,11,1,T1 ,,,09:40.0,10:34.0,00:54.0,,,,,,
1849,11,1,T1 ,,next page next,09:40.0,09:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1850,11,1,T1 ,perfect,,09:43.0,09:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1851,11,1,T1 ,,oh fifteen equals negative eight plus p,09:44.0,09:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1852,11,1,T1 ,so appears to be the same thing,,09:48.0,09:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1853,11,1,T1 ,we want to add eight to get the variable one and that's,,09:51.0,09:56.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1854,11,1,T1 ,,yup I know we just have pause filler fifteen less eight equals p,09:56.0,10:05.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
1855,11,1,T1 ,,is that fifteen plus eight doing about (inaudible) stop working sixteen,10:05.0,10:12.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1856,11,1,T1 ,,wait no that can't be write,10:13.0,10:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1857,11,1,T1 ,,ah green work,10:14.0,10:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1858,11,1,T1 ,,it's twenty-three,10:16.0,10:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1859,11,1,T1 ,,there we go,10:17.0,10:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1860,11,1,T1 ,,so fifteen plus eight equals twenty-three which means twenty-three equals,10:19.0,10:27.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
1861,11,1,T1 ,equals p,,10:27.0,10:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1862,11,1,T1 ,,p,10:28.0,10:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1863,11,1,T1 ,eight seems like,,10:29.0,10:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1864,11,1,T1 ,,twenty-three let's just say that,10:31.0,10:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1865,11,1,T1 ,,there we go,10:33.0,10:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1866,11,1,T1 ,twenty-three equals,,10:34.0,10:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1867,11,1,T1 ,,page,10:34.0,10:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1868,11,1,T1 ,,,10:36.0,10:56.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
1869,11,1,T1 ,next page there we go,,10:36.0,10:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1870,11,1,T1 ,,seventeen equals k plus eleven,10:38.0,10:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1871,11,1,T1 ,,well this time we'll have to subtract from this side of stuff,10:41.0,10:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1872,11,1,T1 ,yup because it is being,,10:44.0,10:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1873,11,1,T1 ,,yup because this time it's pause filler here yeah,10:46.0,10:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1874,11,1,T1 ,,mine is eleven so that means that pause filler six equals k,10:49.0,10:55.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1875,11,1,T1 ,,,10:58.0,13:16.0,02:18.0,,,,,,
1876,11,1,T1 ,,for the next page I see them,10:58.0,11:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1877,11,1,T1 ,,so forty-four x minus,11:01.0,11:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1878,11,1,T1 ,so forty-four (inaudible) multiply,,11:04.0,11:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1879,11,1,T1 ,,oh that's an equal sign,11:06.0,11:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1880,11,1,T1 ,,I was like it just looked like minus,11:07.0,11:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1881,11,1,T1 ,,oh so yup forty-four times x equals negative two twenty which means that,11:09.0,11:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1882,11,1,T1 ,so the opposite of it so then you would pause filler,,11:14.0,11:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1883,11,1,T1 ,,wait is that negative two twenty,11:17.0,11:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1884,11,1,T1 ,,or what's going on right now,11:19.0,11:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1885,11,1,T1 ,pause filler I just see forty-four x equals twenty,,11:20.0,11:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1886,11,1,T1 ,yeah I don't see negative,,11:23.0,11:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1887,11,1,T1 ,,the top line is kind of like weird,11:25.0,11:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1888,11,1,T1 ,all right,,11:27.0,11:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1889,11,1,T1 ,,so just yeah pause filler so I see we just x equals two twenty divided by forty-four,11:28.0,11:38.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
1890,11,1,T1 ,,god damn it,11:38.0,11:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1891,11,1,T1 ,,which pause filler divided by two zero,11:39.0,11:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1892,11,1,T1 ,,let's just say divided by yeah divided by two,11:42.0,11:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1893,11,1,T1 ,,okay pause filler which means that one no one one zero,11:48.0,11:54.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1894,11,1,T1 ,,damn it,11:54.0,11:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1895,11,1,T1 ,all right well we can do it,,11:56.0,11:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1896,11,1,T1 ,,divided by twenty-two,11:58.0,12:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1897,11,1,T1 ,if that way works for you,,12:00.0,12:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1898,11,1,T1 ,we can do it that way but,,12:01.0,12:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1899,11,1,T1 ,,yeah which way do you usually do it yeah,12:02.0,12:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1900,11,1,T1 ,to tell you the truth I'll probably just use the calculator,,12:05.0,12:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1901,11,1,T1 ,but since I don't have that,,12:07.0,12:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1902,11,1,T1 ,pause filler we could set up where pause filler (inaudible) twenty,,12:10.0,12:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1903,11,1,T1 ,then to go like this,,12:15.0,12:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1904,11,1,T1 ,,I mean we could factor it yeah,12:19.0,12:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1905,11,1,T1 ,yeah this is the longest way,,12:22.0,12:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1906,11,1,T1 ,but if we could do that way or wherever way,,12:23.0,12:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1907,11,1,T1 ,,that's (inaudible) yeah pause filler,12:25.0,12:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1908,11,1,T1 ,but if you want to factor it go ahead,,12:26.0,12:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1909,11,1,T1 ,,let's see,12:30.0,12:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1910,11,1,T1 ,,I feel like this would be a little easier on paper,12:31.0,12:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,SD
1911,11,1,T1 ,,okay one one zero to be like fifty,12:34.0,12:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1912,11,1,T1 ,,and then that would be five,12:39.0,12:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1913,11,1,T1 ,,would that be fifty-five,12:41.0,12:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1914,11,1,T1 ,,oh I think so,12:43.0,12:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1915,11,1,T1 ,,yeah fifty-five over eleven,12:44.0,12:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1916,11,1,T1 ,and then we can check,,12:46.0,12:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1917,11,1,T1 ,,oh wait doesn't that just mean that it's five over five wait five,12:50.0,12:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1918,11,1,T1 ,I'm actually not sure,,12:55.0,12:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,SD,
1919,11,1,T1 ,,I'm not sure either,12:57.0,12:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,SD
1920,11,1,T1 ,,let's just say x equals five,12:58.0,13:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1921,11,1,T1 ,,bam simplify everything,13:01.0,13:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1922,11,1,T1 ,,let's just assume that's right,13:03.0,13:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1923,11,1,T1 ,,and if all else fails x equals two twenty over forty-four,13:06.0,13:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1924,11,1,T1 ,all right,,13:14.0,13:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1925,11,1,T1 ,,bam close enough,13:15.0,13:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1926,11,1,T1 ,all right so I assume,,13:16.0,13:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1927,11,1,T1 ,,,13:19.0,14:09.0,00:50.0,,,,,,
1928,11,1,T1 ,,negative nine plus thirteen p equals forty-one,13:19.0,13:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1929,11,1,T1 ,so first step is to add the constant I think it's called,,13:23.0,13:29.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1930,11,1,T1 ,,yeah I guess because the quotient is this thing that you multiply by five,13:30.0,13:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1931,11,1,T1 ,yeah yeah the constant,,13:34.0,13:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1932,11,1,T1 ,,so yeah,13:36.0,13:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1933,11,1,T1 ,so both that yeah,,13:37.0,13:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1934,11,1,T1 ,so add nine,,13:38.0,13:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1935,11,1,T1 ,,so then fifty equals thirteen p,13:41.0,13:47.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1936,11,1,T1 ,,which means that p equals fifteen over thirty oh no fifty over thirteen,13:47.0,13:58.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
1937,11,1,T1 ,,correct,13:58.0,13:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1938,11,1,T1 ,,which means that pause filler and you can't simplify that because p is prime,14:00.0,14:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1939,11,1,T1 ,,bam next,14:04.0,14:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1940,11,1,T1 ,,or because thirteen is prime,14:06.0,14:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1941,11,1,T1 ,perfect,,14:08.0,14:08.0,00:00.0,,,UL,,,
1942,11,1,T1 ,,yup,14:08.0,14:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1943,11,1,T1 ,all right another same problem,,14:09.0,14:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1944,11,1,T1 ,,,14:09.0,14:41.0,00:32.0,,,,,,
1945,11,1,T1 ,pause filler so first step,,14:15.0,14:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1946,11,1,T1 ,subtract ten,,14:16.0,14:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1947,11,1,T1 ,,yeah subtract ten,14:17.0,14:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1948,11,1,T1 ,,so six x,14:18.0,14:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1949,11,1,T1 ,just like the last one except,,14:19.0,14:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1950,11,1,T1 ,,equals twenty-four,14:21.0,14:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1951,11,1,T1 ,yup and then divide,,14:25.0,14:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1952,11,1,T1 ,,which means divide it by four so six,14:27.0,14:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1953,11,1,T1 ,,yeah pause filler so twenty-four,14:32.0,14:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1954,11,1,T1 ,,I know that's easy,14:34.0,14:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1955,11,1,T1 ,,it's like four,14:36.0,14:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1956,11,1,T1 ,,is that four,14:36.0,14:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1957,11,1,T1 ,,I think that's four,14:37.0,14:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1958,11,1,T1 ,yup it's four,,14:37.0,14:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1959,11,1,T1 ,,x equals four,14:38.0,14:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1960,11,1,T1 ,,so good at writing on this,14:42.0,14:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1961,11,1,T1 ,,,14:45.0,15:51.0,01:06.0,,,,,,
1962,11,1,T1 ,,okay next,14:45.0,14:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1963,11,1,T1 ,,next click,14:47.0,14:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1964,11,1,T1 ,,I'm clicking,14:48.0,14:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1965,11,1,T1 ,,I'm trying to click oh,14:49.0,14:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1966,11,1,T1 ,oh yeah I get it oh wait,,14:50.0,14:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1967,11,1,T1 ,I think (inaudible),,14:53.0,14:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1968,11,1,T1 ,,yeah I think (inaudible),14:54.0,14:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1969,11,1,T1 ,pause filler wait,,14:55.0,14:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1970,11,1,T1 ,,there we go,14:55.0,14:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1971,11,1,T1 ,seven number seven,,14:56.0,14:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1972,11,1,T1 ,,seven,14:57.0,14:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1973,11,1,T1 ,,there we go pause filler,14:58.0,14:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1974,11,1,T1 ,forty equals negative twenty-two plus fifteen k,,15:00.0,15:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1975,11,1,T1 ,,plus well first step would be to add the thing so pause filler yup,15:03.0,15:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1976,11,1,T1 ,yeah twenty-two to both sides,,15:07.0,15:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1977,11,1,T1 ,,sixty-two equals fifteen k yeah,15:10.0,15:16.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
1978,11,1,T1 ,sixty yup,,15:16.0,15:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1979,11,1,T1 ,and then you're going to want to divide fifteen k to both sides,,15:17.0,15:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1980,11,1,T1 ,,so then sixty-two divided by fifteen equals k,15:22.0,15:29.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
1981,11,1,T1 ,,yay,15:29.0,15:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1982,11,1,T1 ,,pause filler can we simplify that,15:31.0,15:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1983,11,1,T1 ,,I don't know,15:33.0,15:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1984,11,1,T1 ,,okay I don't think so because it would have to be a five right,15:33.0,15:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1985,11,1,T1 ,yeah,,15:37.0,15:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1986,11,1,T1 ,,pause filler oh we won't be able to divide it by three,15:39.0,15:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
1987,11,1,T1 ,,but I don't care anymore,15:42.0,15:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1988,11,1,T1 ,,so okay so well first is that an equals,15:43.0,15:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1989,11,1,T1 ,that's not a minus,,15:47.0,15:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1990,11,1,T1 ,,okay that's an equals,15:49.0,15:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1991,11,1,T1 ,,there we go,15:50.0,15:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1992,11,1,T1 ,,that's an equals,15:50.0,15:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
1993,11,1,T1 ,,,15:52.0,16:38.0,00:46.0,,,,,,
1994,11,1,T1 ,,pause filler thirty-three minus twelve plus seven,15:52.0,15:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
1995,11,1,T1 ,,so then first we'd have to pause filler minus the twelve,15:58.0,16:03.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1996,11,1,T1 ,yup,,16:04.0,16:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
1997,11,1,T1 ,,so pause filler thirty-three minus twelve equals,16:04.0,16:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
1998,11,1,T1 ,,pause filler twenty-one,16:10.0,16:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
1999,11,1,T1 ,,so twenty-one equals seven x yup,16:12.0,16:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2000,11,1,T1 ,and then what again to do off of that,,16:16.0,16:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2001,11,1,T1 ,,seven x,16:18.0,16:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2002,11,1,T1 ,,and after that I'll just that's seventy-eight,16:19.0,16:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2003,11,1,T1 ,,I'm touching random buttons,16:22.0,16:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2004,11,1,T1 ,,pause filler which means that pause filler x equals three because yeah,16:24.0,16:29.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2005,11,1,T1 ,because yeah seven divided by twenty-one equals three,,16:29.0,16:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2006,11,1,T1 ,and we cannot simplify that anymore,,16:34.0,16:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2007,11,1,T1 ,,yup because three is just three three,16:36.0,16:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2008,11,1,T1 ,so this one there's pause filler we're going to do it step by step,,16:38.0,16:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2009,11,1,T1 ,,,16:38.0,17:21.0,00:43.0,,,,,,
2010,11,1,T1 ,and we can do it like,,16:41.0,16:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2011,11,1,T1 ,,let's just subtract p first so that begins,16:44.0,16:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2012,11,1,T1 ,subtract p first,,16:47.0,16:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2013,11,1,T1 ,that's a good,,16:48.0,16:49.0,00:01.0,,,UL,,,
2014,11,1,T1 ,,fifteen equals two p yup,16:49.0,16:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2015,11,1,T1 ,all right and then plus twelve,,16:52.0,16:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2016,11,1,T1 ,and then let's add,,16:56.0,16:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2017,11,1,T1 ,,subtract twelve right,16:58.0,16:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2018,11,1,T1 ,,that would make,16:59.0,16:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2019,11,1,T1 ,subtract twelve,,16:59.0,17:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2020,11,1,T1 ,yup that would be the next step all right,,17:00.0,17:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2021,11,1,T1 ,,yup pause filler so then subtract twelve,17:02.0,17:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2022,11,1,T1 ,,it would just be three equals two p,17:04.0,17:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2023,11,1,T1 ,,and that means that p equals three over two,17:09.0,17:16.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2024,11,1,T1 ,,and we can't simplify that because both of them are prime,17:16.0,17:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2025,11,1,T1 ,perfect,,17:19.0,17:19.0,00:00.0,,,UL,,,
2026,11,1,T1 ,that's great,,17:20.0,17:20.0,00:00.0,,,UL,,,
2027,11,1,T1 ,,wonderful,17:20.0,17:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2028,11,1,T1 ,oop I skipped one,,17:23.0,17:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2029,11,1,T1 ,,,17:24.0,19:21.0,01:57.0,,,,,,
2030,11,1,T1 ,oops number ten,,17:24.0,17:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2031,11,1,T1 ,yup last problem,,17:26.0,17:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2032,11,1,T1 ,number ten,,17:27.0,17:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2033,11,1,T1 ,so again we can do it we can pause filler start we can do lots of things,,17:28.0,17:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2034,11,1,T1 ,but let's just start off simpl with the k,,17:32.0,17:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2035,11,1,T1 ,and get that out of the way first,,17:35.0,17:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2036,11,1,T1 ,,okay so that would mean we subtract the k,17:37.0,17:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2037,11,1,T1 ,,so that means that negative ten equals seven k minus sixty-eight okay,17:38.0,17:48.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
2038,11,1,T1 ,yup,,17:49.0,17:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2039,11,1,T1 ,,okay bam,17:49.0,17:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2040,11,1,T1 ,,that's it pause filler,17:52.0,17:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2041,11,1,T1 ,,and that means that we can add sixty-eight,17:54.0,17:59.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2042,11,1,T1 ,,so that means that pause filler,17:59.0,18:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2043,11,1,T1 ,,oh crap,18:00.0,18:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2044,11,1,T1 ,,what's negative ten plus sixty-eight,18:01.0,18:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2045,11,1,T1 ,,it's fifty-eight okay fifty-eight,18:03.0,18:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2046,11,1,T1 ,,god damn it,18:07.0,18:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2047,11,1,T1 ,,I keep I'm holding this like a pencil,18:07.0,18:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2048,11,1,T1 ,,so I keep pressing buttons that are weird because these things have button on the weird side,18:09.0,18:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2049,11,1,T1 ,,pause filler fifty-eight equals seven k,18:15.0,18:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2050,11,1,T1 ,,and fifty-eight is divisible by seven right,18:19.0,18:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2051,11,1,T1 ,,now it's fifty-six right,18:22.0,18:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2052,11,1,T1 ,wait what did you just do pause filler with eight,,18:24.0,18:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2053,11,1,T1 ,,pause filler I added sixty-eight to both sides,18:25.0,18:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2054,11,1,T1 ,okay yup and yeah sixty-eight,,18:27.0,18:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2055,11,1,T1 ,so then you get fifty-eight,,18:29.0,18:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2056,11,1,T1 ,and then so then try to divide by seven and,,18:30.0,18:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2057,11,1,T1 ,,don't you even divide that by like I feel that's like no that's six,18:33.0,18:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2058,11,1,T1 ,,I think I'm thinking of six points,18:37.0,18:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2059,11,1,T1 ,,no that's eight,18:38.0,18:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2060,11,1,T1 ,,oh crap,18:39.0,18:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2061,11,1,T1 ,,pause filler well I know that seven is prime anyway,18:40.0,18:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2062,11,1,T1 ,,so it doesn't matter all right,18:41.0,18:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2063,11,1,T1 ,so wait I mean let's just like count up by seven,,18:42.0,18:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2064,11,1,T1 ,so three times seven twenty-one,,18:43.0,18:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2065,11,1,T1 ,four times seven thirty-eight,,18:44.0,18:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2066,11,1,T1 ,divide by seven,,18:45.0,18:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2067,11,1,T1 ,,thirty-five,18:46.0,18:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2068,11,1,T1 ,six times seven,,18:46.0,18:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2069,11,1,T1 ,,forty-two and,18:47.0,18:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2070,11,1,T1 ,seven times seven,,18:48.0,18:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2071,11,1,T1 ,,forty-nine,18:48.0,18:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2072,11,1,T1 ,,so then fifty-six,18:49.0,18:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2073,11,1,T1 ,,so yeah that's the basic form,18:49.0,18:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2074,11,1,T1 ,,and this is the one more that they tell us to go,18:50.0,18:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

2078,11,1,T1 ,,basically what happened was I was doodling on this board,18:55.0,18:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2079,11,1,T1 ,,and I pressed down too hard,18:57.0,18:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

2204,11,1,T2 ,and then just multiply by negative one because you don't want a negative variable so,,31:08.0,31:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2205,11,1,T2 ,,we'll leave it y equals negative five,31:15.0,31:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2206,11,1,T2 ,perfect,,31:19.0,31:20.0,00:01.0,,,,UL,,
2207,11,1,T2 ,,that's it,31:21.0,31:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2208,11,1,T2 ,oh I skipped one my bad,,31:23.0,31:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2209,11,1,T2 ,,,31:25.0,32:39.0,01:14.0,,,,,,
2210,11,1,T2 ,,all right negative k minus fourteen,31:25.0,31:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2211,11,1,T2 ,,ah this time you have two variables,31:29.0,31:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2212,11,1,T2 ,,so you'll have to like get rid of one of them,31:32.0,31:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2213,11,1,T2 ,,I recommend adding it makes it easier,31:34.0,31:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2214,11,1,T2 ,yeah I'll add by k,,31:36.0,31:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2215,11,1,T2 ,,okay,31:38.0,31:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2216,11,1,T2 ,and then I get negative fourteen equals thirty-six,,31:39.0,31:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2217,11,1,T2 ,,plus two k I think all right yeah,31:47.0,31:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2218,11,1,T2 ,and then add fourteen,,31:52.0,31:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2219,11,1,T2 ,,pause filler you could add fourteen,31:56.0,31:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2220,11,1,T2 ,,but I'd recommend subtracting them,31:57.0,32:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2221,11,1,T2 ,oh yeah yeah yeah mine just only do that yeah,,32:00.0,32:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2222,11,1,T2 ,,yeah,32:02.0,32:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2223,11,1,T2 ,and then I'm going to get,,32:06.0,32:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2224,11,1,T2 ,pause filler what am I going to get here,,32:09.0,32:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2225,11,1,T2 ,,pause filler negative fifty no,32:14.0,32:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2226,11,1,T2 ,yeah negative fifty because yeah,,32:17.0,32:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2227,11,1,T2 ,,yup,32:20.0,32:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2228,11,1,T2 ,negative fifty,,32:20.0,32:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2229,11,1,T2 ,,equals two k right,32:23.0,32:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2230,11,1,T2 ,yup and divide,,32:25.0,32:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2231,11,1,T2 ,,by two and you like thing good five solve next,32:28.0,32:38.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
2232,11,1,T2 ,,,32:39.0,33:19.0,00:40.0,,,,,,
2233,11,1,T2 ,pause filler again two variables,,32:39.0,32:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2234,11,1,T2 ,I'll do the same thing as the last time add p,,32:41.0,32:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2235,11,1,T2 ,,so then you get two b,32:46.0,32:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2236,11,1,T2 ,,or two b equals thirteen yeah,32:50.0,32:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2237,11,1,T2 ,then I'll subtract that,,32:53.0,32:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2238,11,1,T2 ,and I get here,,32:55.0,32:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2239,11,1,T2 ,,so then you'd get four I believe,32:57.0,32:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2240,11,1,T2 ,oh yeah four,,32:59.0,33:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2241,11,1,T2 ,oops undo,,33:00.0,33:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2242,11,1,T2 ,yeah,,33:06.0,33:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2243,11,1,T2 ,,yup,33:07.0,33:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2244,11,1,T2 ,four equals two b,,33:08.0,33:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2245,11,1,T2 ,b equals two,,33:12.0,33:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2246,11,1,T2 ,,good,33:15.0,33:15.0,00:00.0,,,UL,,,
2247,11,1,T2 ,is that all good,,33:15.0,33:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2248,11,1,T2 ,,yup pretty sure so,33:16.0,33:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2249,11,1,T2 ,,oh yeah,33:18.0,33:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2250,11,1,T2 ,,,33:20.0,34:08.0,00:48.0,,,,,,
2251,11,1,T2 ,,I can do this thing,33:20.0,33:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2252,11,1,T2 ,all right pause filler,,33:24.0,33:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2253,11,1,T2 ,,negative nine g equals eighty-one huh,33:24.0,33:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2254,11,1,T2 ,so first I want to make the variable positive right,,33:28.0,33:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2255,11,1,T2 ,,yeah I think that's reasonable,33:33.0,33:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2256,11,1,T2 ,,nine g equals eighty-one or negative eighty-one,33:37.0,33:48.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
2257,11,1,T2 ,I'm just going to make that negative,,33:48.0,33:53.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2258,11,1,T2 ,yup that's negative that's all,,33:53.0,33:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2259,11,1,T2 ,,yup (inaudible),33:55.0,33:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2260,11,1,T2 ,all right and then g would equal negative nine,,33:55.0,34:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2261,11,1,T2 ,,yup because you just divide it by the eighty-one,34:01.0,34:07.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2262,11,1,T2 ,exactly yup,,34:07.0,34:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2263,11,1,T2 ,oops,,34:08.0,34:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2264,11,1,T2 ,,okay well skip,34:08.0,34:13.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2265,11,1,T2 ,,,34:12.0,34:49.0,00:37.0,,,,,,
2266,11,1,T2 ,,okay,34:13.0,34:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2267,11,1,T2 ,,so eighty-two equals negative eight y plus ten,34:13.0,34:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2268,11,1,T2 ,two,,34:17.0,34:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2269,11,1,T2 ,is this correct,,34:19.0,34:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2270,11,1,T2 ,I'm just making sure,,34:21.0,34:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2271,11,1,T2 ,,yup I think so yup pretty sure,34:23.0,34:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2272,11,1,T2 ,and then multiply it by negative one,,34:24.0,34:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2273,11,1,T2 ,and I'm going to get myself up on this side,,34:27.0,34:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2274,11,1,T2 ,so multiply equals negative just let me do divide it by eight,,34:30.0,34:41.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
2275,11,1,T2 ,and that's nine yeah,,34:42.0,34:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2276,11,1,T2 ,y equals nine,,34:46.0,34:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2277,11,1,T2 ,,okay next oh try,34:50.0,34:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2278,11,1,T2 ,we're really good at skipping things,,34:53.0,34:55.0,00:02.0,,,,LPB,,
2279,11,1,T2 ,,yeah because we both go for the thing okay,34:55.0,34:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2280,11,1,T2 ,so,,34:59.0,35:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2281,11,1,T2 ,,,34:59.0,36:41.0,01:42.0,,,,,,
2282,11,1,T2 ,,because this is only one variable,35:01.0,35:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2283,11,1,T2 ,,so we should just get rid of the constant on the right side or on the side with the variable or,35:03.0,35:09.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2284,11,1,T2 ,,so pause filler a hundred seven minus sixty-five,35:10.0,35:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2285,11,1,T2 ,,I'll have to do math,35:13.0,35:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2286,11,1,T2 ,,oh wait no you'll have to do math uh-huh,35:15.0,35:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2287,11,1,T2 ,oh I have to do math,,35:17.0,35:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2288,11,1,T2 ,one o seven sixty-five,,35:20.0,35:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2289,11,1,T2 ,we got two,,35:27.0,35:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2290,11,1,T2 ,and we got four,,35:28.0,35:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2291,11,1,T2 ,oh yeah yeah oh I did that wrong,,35:31.0,35:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2292,11,1,T2 ,I suck at,,35:34.0,35:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2293,11,1,T2 ,,no you did that right,35:35.0,35:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2294,11,1,T2 ,,I think you did,35:37.0,35:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2295,11,1,T2 ,,I'm certain you did,35:38.0,35:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2296,11,1,T2 ,,yes you did,35:39.0,35:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2297,11,1,T2 ,,I felt very badly,35:40.0,35:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2298,11,1,T2 ,yeah so yup yup yup,,35:42.0,35:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2299,11,1,T2 ,pause filler forty-two,,35:46.0,35:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2300,11,1,T2 ,so forty-two,,35:47.0,35:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2301,11,1,T2 ,anyway we'll just do negative forty-two because we're going to multiply it by negative one,,35:48.0,35:53.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2302,11,1,T2 ,,yup five equals x or fourteen x,35:53.0,35:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2303,11,1,T2 ,equals fourteen x,,35:57.0,35:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2304,11,1,T2 ,and it's three I'm guessing,,35:58.0,36:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2305,11,1,T2 ,yeah x,,36:01.0,36:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2306,11,1,T2 ,I'm just doing it in my head,,36:02.0,36:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2307,11,1,T2 ,pause filler I guess x equals three,,36:04.0,36:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2308,11,1,T2 ,,x equals three I'm not so sure because forty-two divided by fourteen,36:06.0,36:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2309,11,1,T2 ,would it equal I don't feel it's not going to be two,,36:12.0,36:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2310,11,1,T2 ,,let's see I know you can turn this to seven,36:16.0,36:21.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2311,11,1,T2 ,well no,,36:21.0,36:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2312,11,1,T2 ,,yeah yeah this is pause filler twenty-one over seven,36:21.0,36:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2313,11,1,T2 ,,oh which means it's one over wait one over three,36:25.0,36:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2314,11,1,T2 ,so,,36:29.0,36:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2315,11,1,T2 ,,no yeah I think you're right,36:30.0,36:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2316,11,1,T2 ,,it is three oh wait yeah,36:31.0,36:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2317,11,1,T2 ,all right we could always guess and check,,36:33.0,36:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2318,11,1,T2 ,but I'm pretty sure yeah,,36:35.0,36:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2319,11,1,T2 ,so let's move on,,36:38.0,36:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2320,11,1,T2 ,,yeah that's three over one yup,36:39.0,36:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2321,11,1,T2 ,,,36:42.0,38:43.0,02:01.0,,,,,,
2322,11,1,T2 ,oh lots of negatives,,36:42.0,36:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2323,11,1,T2 ,so let's do this first,,36:44.0,36:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2324,11,1,T2 ,,start by adding yup,36:47.0,36:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2325,11,1,T2 ,pause filler yeah seventy-five equals negative nine k,,36:49.0,36:57.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2326,11,1,T2 ,and let's negative seventy nine k,,36:58.0,37:07.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
2327,11,1,T2 ,which is,,37:10.0,37:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2328,11,1,T2 ,feel like,,37:13.0,37:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2329,11,1,T2 ,so five right,,37:17.0,37:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2330,11,1,T2 ,so k equals negative five,,37:20.0,37:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2331,11,1,T2 ,,all right wait,37:24.0,37:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2332,11,1,T2 ,is that correct wait no no not five,,37:26.0,37:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2333,11,1,T2 ,,is that twenty-five,37:28.0,37:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2334,11,1,T2 ,twenty-five,,37:30.0,37:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2335,11,1,T2 ,,can you divide twenty-five by three no,37:32.0,37:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2336,11,1,T2 ,well we're doing,,37:35.0,37:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2337,11,1,T2 ,,simplify it up,37:36.0,37:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2338,11,1,T2 ,we're doing,,37:39.0,37:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2339,11,1,T2 ,negative seventy-five divided by nine,,37:41.0,37:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2340,11,1,T2 ,,well it's seventy-five,37:44.0,37:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2341,11,1,T2 ,,I thought it was twenty-five,37:45.0,37:45.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2342,11,1,T2 ,yeah sorry,,37:46.0,37:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2343,11,1,T2 ,seventy-five so,,37:48.0,37:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2344,11,1,T2 ,,seventy-five I think it's only seventy-five nines because I don't think you can divide it by three or anything for nine,37:50.0,37:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2345,11,1,T2 ,,let's see if you divide it by nine it would be pause filler oh wait it's things line up to nine,37:57.0,38:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2346,11,1,T2 ,,and they go,38:02.0,38:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2347,11,1,T2 ,,so no,38:03.0,38:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2348,11,1,T2 ,,and if you added it up,38:05.0,38:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2349,11,1,T2 ,,and if it were divisible by three that would be divisible by three,38:06.0,38:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2350,11,1,T2 ,,oh wait no it is divisible by three twenty-five,38:12.0,38:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2351,11,1,T2 ,so oh yeah twenty-five,,38:16.0,38:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2352,11,1,T2 ,and then just do twenty so,,38:18.0,38:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2353,11,1,T2 ,,twenty-five over three,38:19.0,38:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2354,11,1,T2 ,twenty-five over three,,38:21.0,38:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2355,11,1,T2 ,and I don't think you can simplify that anymore,,38:22.0,38:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2356,11,1,T2 ,,yeah I don't think it can get simplified any more than that,38:27.0,38:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2357,11,1,T2 ,,twenty-five over three,38:30.0,38:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2358,11,1,T2 ,and (inaudible) really quickly just say that we,,38:31.0,38:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2359,11,1,T2 ,,yeah (inaudible) did that yup,38:34.0,38:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2360,11,1,T2 ,yeah something like that there,,38:37.0,38:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2361,11,1,T2 ,,say something that just looks like math,38:40.0,38:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2362,11,1,T2 ,,so it looks like we did something,38:42.0,38:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2363,11,1,T2 ,all right pause filler so you look first,,38:43.0,38:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2364,11,1,T2 ,,,38:43.0,40:18.0,01:35.0,,,,,,
2365,11,1,T2 ,let's add fifteen first,,38:46.0,38:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2366,11,1,T2 ,,yup again negative two equal ninety minus sixteen right,38:48.0,38:56.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2367,11,1,T2 ,yup,,38:57.0,38:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2368,11,1,T2 ,,and then you would add the sixteen,38:59.0,39:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2369,11,1,T2 ,exactly,,39:07.0,39:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2370,11,1,T2 ,pause filler sixteen so forty-eight,,39:12.0,39:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2371,11,1,T2 ,no forty-six negative forty-six,,39:17.0,39:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2372,11,1,T2 ,,no no no because they're both negative right,39:21.0,39:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2373,11,1,T2 ,oh yeah no no no no this is negative,,39:23.0,39:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2374,11,1,T2 ,and so I'm adding it right,,39:25.0,39:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2375,11,1,T2 ,,okay you're adding it,39:28.0,39:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2376,11,1,T2 ,,okay I forgot about that,39:29.0,39:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2377,11,1,T2 ,,yeah then you'd be right,39:31.0,39:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2378,11,1,T2 ,,so yeah it would be forty-six right,39:33.0,39:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2379,11,1,T2 ,,I think so let me think (sfx),39:35.0,39:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2380,11,1,T2 ,wait no I don't think it's forty-six,,39:37.0,39:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2381,11,1,T2 ,,pause filler actually you would be thirty-six right because it would be thirty-six because you'd go,39:40.0,39:47.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2382,11,1,T2 ,,yeah I think it would be thirty-six yeah,39:47.0,39:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2383,11,1,T2 ,yeah and so p would equal four,,39:51.0,39:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2384,11,1,T2 ,,that's yup let me just check if that's right,39:56.0,40:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2385,11,1,T2 ,,the problems it's nine,40:00.0,40:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2386,11,1,T2 ,number nine yeah,,40:02.0,40:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2387,11,1,T2 ,you can always yeah check it,,40:03.0,40:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2388,11,1,T2 ,,pause filler,40:04.0,40:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2389,11,1,T2 ,,okay this thing no this isn't even the right question,40:07.0,40:13.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2390,11,1,T2 ,,okay it's not even the right question,40:13.0,40:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2391,11,1,T2 ,,okay whatever sure,40:14.0,40:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2392,11,1,T2 ,,let's just say that,40:16.0,40:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2393,11,1,T2 ,,,40:20.0,41:45.0,01:25.0,,,,,,
2394,11,1,T2 ,oh boy all right,,40:21.0,40:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2395,11,1,T2 ,,this is just going to be interesting,40:22.0,40:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2396,11,1,T2 ,first thing's first,,40:25.0,40:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2397,11,1,T2 ,,get rid of the W weird things on both sides,40:26.0,40:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2398,11,1,T2 ,,so fourteen Ws yes,40:29.0,40:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2399,11,1,T2 ,,so that would mean forty w plus nineteen equals negative one forty-one,40:31.0,40:38.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2400,11,1,T2 ,,oh my god,40:39.0,40:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2401,11,1,T2 ,okay wait pause filler,,40:42.0,40:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2402,11,1,T2 ,,it's forty because pause filler you add the one,40:43.0,40:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2403,11,1,T2 ,,and you had the nones pause filler,40:46.0,40:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2404,11,1,T2 ,okay and then minus subtract I mean pause filler nineteen,,40:50.0,40:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2405,11,1,T2 ,gosh,,40:56.0,40:56.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2406,11,1,T2 ,and then it's negative,,40:58.0,41:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2407,11,1,T2 ,so it's negative one sixty,,41:00.0,41:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2408,11,1,T2 ,,I really hope this data is worth a lot,41:04.0,41:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,SD,
2409,11,1,T2 ,,I hope this data is work stuff,41:07.0,41:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2410,11,1,T2 ,,we work stuff data,41:10.0,41:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2411,11,1,T2 ,am I doing this correctly,,41:10.0,41:17.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2412,11,1,T2 ,,I think so,41:17.0,41:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2413,11,1,T2 ,,okay,41:19.0,41:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2414,11,1,T2 ,,yup one sixty and,41:19.0,41:25.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2415,11,1,T2 ,,so you divide it by forty,41:25.0,41:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2416,11,1,T2 ,,and one sixty divided four it's like wait four times,41:28.0,41:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2417,11,1,T2 ,I'm just going to count in my yeah,,41:33.0,41:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2418,11,1,T2 ,it's four,,41:36.0,41:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2419,11,1,T2 ,it's four yeah,,41:37.0,41:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2420,11,1,T2 ,,yes it's four,41:37.0,41:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2421,11,1,T2 ,,yeah it's four I believe it's four,41:38.0,41:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2422,11,1,T2 ,,it's negative or yeah it's negative,41:39.0,41:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2423,11,1,T2 ,it is negative two yeah,,41:41.0,41:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2424,11,1,T2 ,,yup,41:43.0,41:43.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2425,11,1,T2 ,negative four,,41:44.0,41:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2426,11,1,T2 ,,okay oh stop,41:45.0,41:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2427,11,1,T2 ,love it,,41:47.0,41:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2428,11,1,T2 ,,pause filler you want to be the one to get them or,41:50.0,41:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2429,11,1,T2 ,I'll do it,,41:54.0,41:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2430,11,1,T2 ,,yeah it hasn't crashed this time so,41:55.0,41:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2431,11,1,T2 ,,it's always good,41:57.0,42:01.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2432,11,1,T2 ,,pretty typical that we don't have twenty-two,42:03.0,42:19.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
2433,11,1,T2 ,,you've gone to the page that is paged,42:19.0,42:25.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2434,11,1,T2 ,,good,42:26.0,42:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

2436,11,1,T2 ,,good,42:45.0,42:45.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2437,11,1,T2 ,,well so this time we don't get the guide worksheet,42:51.0,42:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2438,11,1,T2 ,,,42:51.0,49:55.0,07:04.0,,,,,,
2439,11,1,T2 ,,like whoop,42:55.0,42:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2440,11,1,T2 ,,,42:55.0,43:38.0,00:43.0,,,,,,
2441,11,1,T2 ,,all right so we have Ys on both sides,42:55.0,42:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2442,11,1,T2 ,,so we have to fix that right,42:58.0,43:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2443,11,1,T2 ,yeah,,43:01.0,43:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2444,11,1,T2 ,,so pause filler yeah I think we know what we're doing right,43:02.0,43:09.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2445,11,1,T2 ,yeah,,43:09.0,43:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2446,11,1,T2 ,,negative sixty-three pause filler,43:10.0,43:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2447,11,1,T2 ,,so two y yup,43:11.0,43:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2448,11,1,T2 ,,and then subtract the thing on that side,43:11.0,43:16.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2449,11,1,T2 ,,you get hundred and six I think,43:16.0,43:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2450,11,1,T2 ,Yep,,43:20.0,43:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2451,11,1,T2 ,,yeah negative hundred six,43:21.0,43:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2452,11,1,T2 ,,negative hundred six equals two y between that is y equals,43:22.0,43:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2453,11,1,T2 ,,pause filler negative six divided by pause filler,43:29.0,43:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2454,11,1,T2 ,wait it would be like pause filler fifty-three negative fifty-three,,43:32.0,43:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2455,11,1,T2 ,,okay that would be fifty-three,43:36.0,43:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2456,11,1,T2 ,,it's quite simplistic and my dear Watson,43:38.0,43:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2457,11,1,T2 ,,and I'm pause filler Sherlock or whatever Sherlock Holmes,43:42.0,43:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2458,11,1,T2 ,,,43:49.0,45:21.0,01:32.0,,,,,,
2459,11,1,T2 ,,okay pause filler this thing yes negative one eighty-two minus p equals forty-eight plus p,43:49.0,43:55.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2460,11,1,T2 ,,so we have like the weird Ps on both sides,43:55.0,43:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2461,11,1,T2 ,,forty-eight plus p two p right yeah,43:59.0,44:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2462,11,1,T2 ,,let's do this,44:02.0,44:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2463,11,1,T2 ,,pause filler and is that negative or no it's,44:04.0,44:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2464,11,1,T2 ,no,,44:09.0,44:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2465,11,1,T2 ,,yeah so it's positives,44:10.0,44:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2466,11,1,T2 ,,so you just subtract it again right,44:11.0,44:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2467,11,1,T2 ,yeah,,44:13.0,44:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2468,11,1,T2 ,,so then on that side it would be,44:14.0,44:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2469,11,1,T2 ,,negative,44:16.0,44:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2470,11,1,T2 ,,it would be negative quantity,44:16.0,44:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2471,11,1,T2 ,wait wait wait I think I got it,,44:19.0,44:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2472,11,1,T2 ,but you can go ahead,,44:22.0,44:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2473,11,1,T2 ,,it would be like negative quantity one and two plus forty-eight,44:23.0,44:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2474,11,1,T2 ,,so thirty-two,44:27.0,44:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2475,11,1,T2 ,so negative two hundred and thirty right,,44:27.0,44:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2476,11,1,T2 ,,negative thirty,44:30.0,44:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2477,11,1,T2 ,,yup there you go,44:31.0,44:31.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2478,11,1,T2 ,,thanks,44:31.0,44:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2479,11,1,T2 ,,that's really great,44:32.0,44:34.0,00:02.0,,,LPP,,,
2480,11,1,T2 ,,negative thirty pause filler,44:34.0,44:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2481,11,1,T2 ,equals two p,,44:37.0,44:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2482,11,1,T2 ,,yup two p,44:39.0,44:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2483,11,1,T2 ,,so then I guess you just divide the things by stuff so,44:40.0,44:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2484,11,1,T2 ,p would equal pause filler negative,,44:44.0,44:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2485,11,1,T2 ,,one fifteen negative one fifteen right yeah because yeah yeah,44:46.0,44:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2486,11,1,T2 ,wait yeah wait negative one fifteen,,44:51.0,44:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2487,11,1,T2 ,,yup because thirty-eight divided by two is fifteen,44:53.0,44:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2488,11,1,T2 ,,and two hundred divided by two is a hundred,44:56.0,45:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2489,11,1,T2 ,wait negative,,45:00.0,45:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2490,11,1,T2 ,,yeah let me try,45:02.0,45:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2491,11,1,T2 ,oh negative two fifteen,,45:02.0,45:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2492,11,1,T2 ,I thought you just meant negative two fifty yeah negative two fifty,,45:03.0,45:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2493,11,1,T2 ,yup that's great yup,,45:07.0,45:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2494,11,1,T2 ,,one fifteen to times two,45:08.0,45:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2495,11,1,T2 ,,I'm just getting zero carry to one three yeah two yeah,45:10.0,45:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2496,11,1,T2 ,,good we did it,45:15.0,45:17.0,00:02.0,,,LP,,,
2497,11,1,T2 ,,high five,45:17.0,45:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2498,11,1,T2 ,,except we can't high five because we're in like different rooms,45:18.0,45:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2499,11,1,T2 ,,,45:22.0,46:54.0,01:32.0,,,,,,
2500,11,1,T2 ,all right plus two first,,45:22.0,45:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2501,11,1,T2 ,,let's get the weird variables on the same side,45:25.0,45:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2502,11,1,T2 ,,this is like algebra one o one one o one o one o one o one o one one one one one one one one one one,45:30.0,45:40.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
2503,11,1,T2 ,three six I'm just going to write out like a bum,,45:40.0,45:46.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2504,11,1,T2 ,,yup,45:47.0,45:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2505,11,1,T2 ,oh my gosh,,45:49.0,45:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2506,11,1,T2 ,,so one twenty-nine then fifty-three seven three,45:50.0,45:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2507,11,1,T2 ,,so it would be two,45:55.0,45:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2508,11,1,T2 ,,wait yeah yeah wait wait,45:58.0,46:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2509,11,1,T2 ,,is that nine,46:00.0,46:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2510,11,1,T2 ,it's a six,,46:01.0,46:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2511,11,1,T2 ,yeah this is a nine,,46:02.0,46:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2512,11,1,T2 ,,so then yeah it wouldn't be two right because pause filler a two,46:05.0,46:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2513,11,1,T2 ,,wait oh yeah I think you're multiplying,46:09.0,46:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2514,11,1,T2 ,,you're multiplying,46:12.0,46:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2515,11,1,T2 ,oh I'm subtracting this,,46:13.0,46:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2516,11,1,T2 ,,oh you're subtracting,46:16.0,46:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2517,11,1,T2 ,subtracting,,46:17.0,46:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2518,11,1,T2 ,,yeah you're right you are subtracting,46:19.0,46:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2519,11,1,T2 ,,so yeah you're right then it would be six and then,46:21.0,46:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2520,11,1,T2 ,and then eighty-six right,,46:23.0,46:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2521,11,1,T2 ,,yup I think so,46:25.0,46:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2522,11,1,T2 ,,in fact I'm sure now sure,46:26.0,46:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2523,11,1,T2 ,,eighty-six,46:30.0,46:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2524,11,1,T2 ,so eighty-six equals two g,,46:30.0,46:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2525,11,1,T2 ,I think,,46:33.0,46:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2526,11,1,T2 ,it's pretty nice that it's all twos I think,,46:34.0,46:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2527,11,1,T2 ,,yeah,46:39.0,46:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2528,11,1,T2 ,my head and I don't have to,,46:39.0,46:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2529,11,1,T2 ,anyway eighty-six,,46:41.0,46:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2530,11,1,T2 ,so to put that on half,,46:43.0,46:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2531,11,1,T2 ,and then we get forty-three so,,46:45.0,46:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2532,11,1,T2 ,,provided we have to do this on numbers that are not stupid,46:47.0,46:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2533,11,1,T2 ,all right and,,46:51.0,46:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2534,11,1,T2 ,,,46:55.0,47:52.0,00:57.0,,,,,,
2535,11,1,T2 ,pause filler this seems fun,,46:55.0,46:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2536,11,1,T2 ,,M&amp;M (inaudible) so yeah,46:56.0,46:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2537,11,1,T2 ,and then you can also just like do that over there so we get pause filler,,46:58.0,47:06.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2538,11,1,T2 ,,so we know that it'll be two M,47:06.0,47:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2539,11,1,T2 ,,so we can pause filler just stop,47:10.0,47:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2540,11,1,T2 ,,and is that so yeah seventy-one minus forty-three,47:12.0,47:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2541,11,1,T2 ,,whatever that is,47:17.0,47:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2542,11,1,T2 ,,it would be like twenty-eight,47:19.0,47:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2543,11,1,T2 ,,just about the best of it I guess,47:21.0,47:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2544,11,1,T2 ,twenty-eight,,47:27.0,47:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2545,11,1,T2 ,yup twenty-eight equals to pause filler,,47:30.0,47:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2546,11,1,T2 ,,which means that yeah,47:34.0,47:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2547,11,1,T2 ,pause filler wait,,47:40.0,47:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2548,11,1,T2 ,,fourteen right oh which means oh it's seven time four huh that (inaudible),47:41.0,47:47.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2549,11,1,T2 ,wait fourteen,,47:47.0,47:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2550,11,1,T2 ,,what yeah fourteen,47:48.0,47:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2551,11,1,T2 ,yup yup yeah fourteen,,47:50.0,47:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2552,11,1,T2 ,,it's like you addressed on the board,47:56.0,47:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2553,11,1,T2 ,,you like steal it,47:58.0,47:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2554,11,1,T2 ,,,48:00.0,49:29.0,01:29.0,,,,,,
2555,11,1,T2 ,anyway pause filler let's add,,48:00.0,48:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2556,11,1,T2 ,,oh oh look we have another thing,48:04.0,48:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2557,11,1,T2 ,,say yeah plus eleven x certainly,48:07.0,48:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2558,11,1,T2 ,,so so that means that negative sixty-five equals seven,48:09.0,48:17.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2559,11,1,T2 ,eighteen,,48:17.0,48:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2560,11,1,T2 ,,yeah eighteen plus eighteen or seven plus eleven or seven eleven nine eleven,48:17.0,48:27.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
2561,11,1,T2 ,,pause filler yeah eighteen x minus twenty-five all right,48:27.0,48:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2562,11,1,T2 ,and then that would just be pause filler,,48:32.0,48:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2563,11,1,T2 ,crap,,48:35.0,48:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2564,11,1,T2 ,forty,,48:35.0,48:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2565,11,1,T2 ,,forty yeah,48:37.0,48:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2566,11,1,T2 ,negative forty negative,,48:39.0,48:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2567,11,1,T2 ,,yup negative forty mind you,48:40.0,48:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2568,11,1,T2 ,,so negative are very important because I mean that's literally twice the difference,48:41.0,48:47.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2569,11,1,T2 ,,huh two,48:48.0,48:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2570,11,1,T2 ,and it's eighteen,,48:48.0,48:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2571,11,1,T2 ,so like eighteen,,48:52.0,48:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2572,11,1,T2 ,eighteen does not go into forty so,,48:56.0,49:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2573,11,1,T2 ,,well you can divide them both by two,49:00.0,49:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2574,11,1,T2 ,,so you get twenty over,49:02.0,49:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2575,11,1,T2 ,yeah we'll just have to simplify that out,,49:03.0,49:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2576,11,1,T2 ,,twenty over nine,49:06.0,49:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2577,11,1,T2 ,,and I think that's just it twenty over nine,49:07.0,49:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2578,11,1,T2 ,well we can't divide it by three,,49:10.0,49:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2579,11,1,T2 ,we can't divide it by four,,49:12.0,49:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2580,11,1,T2 ,we can't divide it,,49:14.0,49:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2581,11,1,T2 ,,well you should divide it by four,49:15.0,49:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2582,11,1,T2 ,,wait does eighteen divide by four,49:16.0,49:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2583,11,1,T2 ,well no four does not go into nine,,49:19.0,49:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2584,11,1,T2 ,,okay yeah,49:22.0,49:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2585,11,1,T2 ,yeah so it's just twenty twenty or nine,,49:23.0,49:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2586,11,1,T2 ,,just twenty yup negative nine,49:25.0,49:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2587,11,1,T2 ,all right oh it's getting better,,49:29.0,49:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2588,11,1,T2 ,that's what he said,,49:32.0,49:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2589,11,1,T2 ,,,49:35.0,49:55.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
2590,11,1,T2 ,anyway pause filler fifty-six,,49:35.0,49:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2591,11,1,T2 ,,so fifty-six plus forty-four,49:37.0,49:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2592,11,1,T2 ,,hey that's a nice number,49:40.0,49:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2593,11,1,T2 ,,one hundred,49:41.0,49:49.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2594,11,1,T2 ,,it's a preferable number in fact,49:49.0,49:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2595,11,1,T2 ,and then well why don't you look at that two hundred right,,49:52.0,49:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,

2644,11,2,S1 ,,did you know it would be,03:57.0,03:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2645,11,2,S1 ,it wasn't even that much money,,04:00.0,04:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

2650,11,2,S1 ,and I could only use the pass on weekdays though so,,04:10.0,04:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2651,11,2,S1 ,,oh on weekends because weekends (inaudible) very,04:13.0,04:19.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2652,11,2,S1 ,on the weekdays the lines were relatively short,,04:19.0,04:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2653,11,2,S1 ,so it was awesome,,04:23.0,04:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2654,11,2,S1 ,,well the lines were just overall really short meaning it was going to be on Memorial Day,04:25.0,04:33.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2655,11,2,S1 ,that makes sense yeah,,04:33.0,04:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2656,11,2,S1 ,,yeah yup yup yup they had loud noise,04:39.0,04:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2657,11,2,S1 ,,wait is this mouse no it's not where wait,04:53.0,05:01.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2658,11,2,S1 ,,is this shift control L and pan,05:02.0,05:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2659,11,2,S1 ,,what does pan mean,05:04.0,05:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2660,11,2,S1 ,,does shift control (inaudible) wait a minute I found you touching these ones,05:06.0,05:17.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
2661,11,2,S1 ,,the last time I got curious I ruined everything,05:17.0,05:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,SD
2662,11,2,S1 ,,so there we go,05:21.0,05:35.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
2663,11,2,S1 ,sweet are we going to start,,07:09.0,07:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2664,11,2,S1 ,,yup I guess they are,07:11.0,07:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2665,11,2,S1 ,all righty let's get this started,,07:12.0,07:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2666,11,2,S1 ,,so we are okay all right click,07:16.0,07:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2667,11,2,S1 ,,all right we got three o seven times x equals forty,07:20.0,07:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2668,11,2,S1 ,,well I guess first thing we would do is pause filler multiply it by seven,07:25.0,07:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2669,11,2,S1 ,,you get three x equals pause filler forty divided or times seven well,07:28.0,07:36.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2670,11,2,S1 ,,forty time seven pause filler seven times zero is,07:36.0,07:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2671,11,2,S1 ,that's a long way to do it,,07:40.0,07:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2672,11,2,S1 ,that would be a longer way,,07:41.0,07:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2673,11,2,T1 ,,,07:41.0,28:04.0,20:23.0,,,,,,
2674,11,2,T1 ,,,07:42.0,09:24.0,01:42.0,,,,,,
2675,11,2,T1 ,,is pause filler what is four times seven,07:43.0,07:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2676,11,2,T1 ,,it's forty-eight right two hundred eighty there magic,07:46.0,07:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2677,11,2,T1 ,,and then we just divide this by three,07:51.0,07:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2678,11,2,T1 ,and then you get your answer,,07:53.0,07:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2679,11,2,T1 ,,and that means x equals pause filler well pause filler,07:55.0,07:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2680,11,2,T1 ,well but we could do it differently,,07:58.0,08:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2681,11,2,T1 ,,yeah we could do this like this,08:03.0,08:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2682,11,2,T1 ,,yeah let's just do it like pause filler thirty-eight and,08:05.0,08:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2683,11,2,T1 ,one division,,08:10.0,08:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2684,11,2,T1 ,,so zero goes into that zero or twenty-eight pause filler like seven eight or eight time three twenty-four,08:11.0,08:19.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2685,11,2,T1 ,,what's nine times three twenty-seven twenty-seven,08:20.0,08:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2686,11,2,T1 ,,that would be it nine,08:24.0,08:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2687,11,2,T1 ,,and we get twenty-seven,08:26.0,08:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2688,11,2,T1 ,,so we get ten,08:28.0,08:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2689,11,2,T1 ,,so we get pause filler plus three right yeah three,08:30.0,08:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2690,11,2,T1 ,,and then that would be one,08:34.0,08:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2691,11,2,T1 ,,so it would be nine three by three three three three three equals,08:39.0,08:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2692,11,2,T1 ,that's what x would equal,,08:43.0,08:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2693,11,2,T1 ,I'm pretty sure,,08:45.0,08:45.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2694,11,2,T1 ,,I can do three point three three three now,08:45.0,08:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2695,11,2,T1 ,,let's just say we're up ten all right yeah,08:49.0,08:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2696,11,2,T1 ,good all right for the next one let's just divide both sides by the pause filler the opposite of this,,08:53.0,09:01.0,00:08.0,,,UL,,,
2697,11,2,T1 ,so like let's just like,,09:01.0,09:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2698,11,2,T1 ,I mean multiply each side,,09:03.0,09:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2699,11,2,T1 ,so like we'll do fourteen times,,09:04.0,09:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2700,11,2,T1 ,I want to make a dot dot make a dot,,09:09.0,09:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2701,11,2,T1 ,there we go times like eight over three,,09:13.0,09:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2702,11,2,T1 ,,eight over three that's the reciprocal,09:17.0,09:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2703,11,2,T1 ,yeah so that's why you just do the reciprocal of the problem and then,,09:19.0,09:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2704,11,2,T1 ,,well fourteen time eight over three I don't understand how that would work exactly,09:23.0,09:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2705,11,2,T1 ,,,09:24.0,11:31.0,02:07.0,,,,,,
2706,11,2,T1 ,well I mean here let's just do this right,,09:28.0,09:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2707,11,2,T1 ,and then we'll just plug,,09:30.0,09:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2708,11,2,T1 ,,oh yeah you mean multiplying,09:31.0,09:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2709,11,2,T1 ,yeah you multiply not divide,,09:33.0,09:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2710,11,2,T1 ,,yeah okay well you're,09:34.0,09:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2711,11,2,T1 ,it was a dot it wasn't working though,,09:35.0,09:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2712,11,2,T1 ,,yeah I see you're multiplying,09:37.0,09:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2713,11,2,T1 ,,this is to represent the division okay yeah pause filler well this just getting cross multiplied yet,09:39.0,09:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2714,11,2,T1 ,,so we'll just have to do fourteen time eight fourteen times eight,09:45.0,09:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2715,11,2,T1 ,,so eight times four is twenty-four right takes out yeah no no no,09:50.0,09:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2716,11,2,T1 ,,eight time four is thirty-two and then pause filler two okay three,09:55.0,10:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2717,11,2,T1 ,,so it would be one one,10:00.0,10:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2718,11,2,T1 ,so one hundred and one,,10:03.0,10:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2719,11,2,T1 ,,a hundred and twelve,10:04.0,10:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2720,11,2,T1 ,yeah a hundred and twelve,,10:06.0,10:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2721,11,2,T1 ,,a hundred twelve over three pause filler equals k and pause filler,10:09.0,10:16.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2722,11,2,T1 ,,well we'd simplify that or,10:16.0,10:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2723,11,2,T1 ,can we,,10:19.0,10:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2724,11,2,T1 ,,I mean I'm sure we can we just have to get it to prime that right,10:20.0,10:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2725,11,2,T1 ,that should be the exact,,10:24.0,10:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2726,11,2,T1 ,,I'm sure we're good yeah and back that to simplify,10:25.0,10:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2727,11,2,T1 ,,and we can get it so yeah,10:27.0,10:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2728,11,2,T1 ,yeah wait this three can go into twelve so we four by hundred,,10:29.0,10:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2729,11,2,T1 ,,well no no,10:35.0,10:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2730,11,2,T1 ,,let's see if both can be prime factorized pause filler so twelve,10:35.0,10:41.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2731,11,2,T1 ,,I mean one one two divided by,10:41.0,10:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2732,11,2,T1 ,three goes into twelve,,10:45.0,10:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2733,11,2,T1 ,three does not go into a hundred,,10:47.0,10:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2734,11,2,T1 ,,so let's just say that's a (inaudible),10:50.0,10:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2735,11,2,T1 ,,I can get it all right oh plus thirteen,10:53.0,10:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2736,11,2,T1 ,,I think I can see it,10:57.0,10:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2737,11,2,T1 ,remember plus thirteen so what can you do about that,,10:59.0,11:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2738,11,2,T1 ,,yeah subtract the thirteen,11:02.0,11:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2739,11,2,T1 ,,and then what's forty-four minus thirteen would be pause filler,11:03.0,11:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2740,11,2,T1 ,,let's just say one thirty-one okay whatever so,11:08.0,11:13.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2741,11,2,T1 ,and then let's just multiply the reciprocal of one half,,11:13.0,11:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2742,11,2,T1 ,,okay pause filler x equals thirty-one okay,11:16.0,11:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2743,11,2,T1 ,,so it means,11:20.0,11:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2744,11,2,T1 ,the reciprocal of that,,11:20.0,11:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2745,11,2,T1 ,,two,11:23.0,11:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2746,11,2,T1 ,so and let's just move yeah,,11:23.0,11:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2747,11,2,T1 ,,thirteen over one time thirty-one over one,11:25.0,11:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2748,11,2,T1 ,you just do two times thirty-one,,11:32.0,11:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2749,11,2,T1 ,,,11:32.0,12:37.0,01:05.0,,,,,,
2750,11,2,T1 ,,wait no no no,11:36.0,11:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2751,11,2,T1 ,yeah two times thirty-one is our answer,,11:37.0,11:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2752,11,2,T1 ,,no no on it would be thirty-one divided by two wait no no no oh wait no no,11:40.0,11:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2753,11,2,T1 ,,no you're right,11:43.0,11:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2754,11,2,T1 ,,yeah you're right,11:44.0,11:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2755,11,2,T1 ,yeah x is being divided,,11:44.0,11:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2756,11,2,T1 ,,so you will multiply it yeah,11:46.0,11:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2757,11,2,T1 ,,pause filler yeah so two times thirty-one is sixty-two sixty-two,11:48.0,11:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2758,11,2,T1 ,,you have x equals sixty-two,11:52.0,11:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2759,11,2,T1 ,,I mean I'm not sure pause filler no,11:56.0,12:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2760,11,2,T1 ,,just look forward,12:00.0,12:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2761,11,2,T1 ,,thirty-one equals negative sixteen,12:01.0,12:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2762,11,2,T1 ,,oh I don't have to add sixteen here,12:04.0,12:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2763,11,2,T1 ,,so pause filler thirty-one plus sixteen is forty-seven,12:07.0,12:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2764,11,2,T1 ,,forty-seven equals three,12:12.0,12:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2765,11,2,T1 ,and then just do the reciprocal of that,,12:15.0,12:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2766,11,2,T1 ,,which is equals to half x is one over two,12:18.0,12:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2767,11,2,T1 ,,so I mean it's forty yeah seven times two,12:21.0,12:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2768,11,2,T1 ,,it's time two,12:26.0,12:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2769,11,2,T1 ,no just do forty,,12:27.0,12:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2770,11,2,T1 ,this would be easier forty-seven times six over three the reciprocal,,12:29.0,12:34.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2771,11,2,T1 ,and just do that problem,,12:34.0,12:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2772,11,2,T1 ,,pause filler because the reciprocal of that I mean yeah,12:35.0,12:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2773,11,2,T1 ,,that's what we're doing,12:36.0,12:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2774,11,2,T1 ,,but it's just times two,12:37.0,12:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2775,11,2,T1 ,,because six over three is two,12:39.0,12:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2776,11,2,T1 ,wait why would it be two,,12:41.0,12:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2777,11,2,T1 ,,,12:42.0,14:09.0,01:27.0,,,,,,
2778,11,2,T1 ,,because six divided by three equals two,12:42.0,12:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2779,11,2,T1 ,okay wait yeah yeah yeah yeah that works,,12:45.0,12:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2780,11,2,T1 ,that works,,12:47.0,12:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2781,11,2,T1 ,,yeah so forty-seven two equals pause filler ninety-four,12:48.0,12:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2782,11,2,T1 ,,ninety-four equals ninety-four to make it one wait no one,12:52.0,12:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2783,11,2,T1 ,yeah I don't understand why they do three over two because I think,,12:58.0,13:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2784,11,2,T1 ,,it's not equal,13:02.0,13:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2785,11,2,T1 ,because three I mean three over six,,13:03.0,13:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2786,11,2,T1 ,I mean my bad it's not,,13:05.0,13:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2787,11,2,T1 ,it's almost simple as four,,13:06.0,13:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2788,11,2,T1 ,,it's x equals ninety-four for sure,13:08.0,13:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2789,11,2,T1 ,,let's say that's right yeah,13:11.0,13:17.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2790,11,2,T1 ,,is that correct yeah the,13:17.0,13:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2791,11,2,T1 ,they don't show me answers,,13:19.0,13:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2792,11,2,T1 ,but yeah that's how you did the problems correctly,,13:19.0,13:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2793,11,2,T1 ,all right remember this is positive,,13:22.0,13:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2794,11,2,T1 ,but that's negative,,13:25.0,13:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2795,11,2,T1 ,,minus forty-eight I can write anything right there wait (inaudible),13:26.0,13:33.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2796,11,2,T1 ,,let's get rid of that now okay pause filler,13:33.0,13:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2797,11,2,T1 ,,but I can get rid of that so plus,13:39.0,13:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2798,11,2,T1 ,,so we have to subtract forty-eight from ninety-seven well forty-seven time forty-eight,13:42.0,13:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2799,11,2,T1 ,,it's like forty-one I think or forty-nine,13:47.0,13:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2800,11,2,T1 ,just set it up,,13:52.0,13:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2801,11,2,T1 ,what's eight minus seven,,13:53.0,13:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2802,11,2,T1 ,,seven that's forty-eight pause filler,13:54.0,13:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2803,11,2,T1 ,,we have to make those seven fifteen across of that,13:57.0,14:03.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2804,11,2,T1 ,,so that would be a four,14:03.0,14:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2805,11,2,T1 ,you get nine,,14:04.0,14:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2806,11,2,T1 ,,and yeah it would be nine,14:05.0,14:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2807,11,2,T1 ,,so forty-nine that's good,14:06.0,14:07.0,00:01.0,,,,UL,,
2808,11,2,T1 ,yup forty-nine equals negative twelve over five y,,14:07.0,14:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2809,11,2,T1 ,,,14:09.0,16:20.0,02:11.0,,,,,,
2810,11,2,T1 ,and you can wait twelve over five negative twelve over five isn't suppose one and cross multiply then,,14:13.0,14:20.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2811,11,2,T1 ,I mean yeah just the reciprocal of that,,14:20.0,14:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2812,11,2,T1 ,,yup so then five over twelve forty-nine times five over negative five twelve negative five over twelve pause filler let's see forty-nine times five,14:24.0,14:37.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
2813,11,2,T1 ,,well let's do this forty-nine five,14:38.0,14:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2814,11,2,T1 ,,five times nine is forty-five five thirty-four,14:42.0,14:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2815,11,2,T1 ,,and then that's twenty so twenty wait,14:45.0,14:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2816,11,2,T1 ,I can't (inaudible),,14:49.0,14:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2817,11,2,T1 ,,yeah four (inaudible) twenty-four over five two over five,14:51.0,14:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2818,11,2,T1 ,wait how did you get that again,,14:54.0,14:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2819,11,2,T1 ,,because five times nine is forty-five,14:55.0,14:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2820,11,2,T1 ,,so carry the four and then four times,14:58.0,15:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2821,11,2,T1 ,,because it's twenty and then four because (inaudible) so yeah two four five yup,15:01.0,15:07.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2822,11,2,T1 ,okay number seven pause filler I need,,15:07.0,15:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2823,11,2,T1 ,,wait negative pause filler I need to fix that negative x equals,15:10.0,15:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2824,11,2,T1 ,,there we go,15:17.0,15:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2825,11,2,T1 ,,I'm good okay,15:17.0,15:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2826,11,2,T1 ,okay (inaudible) hold on make that box bigger,,15:19.0,15:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2827,11,2,T1 ,,okay so negative,15:22.0,15:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2828,11,2,T1 ,here you go,,15:23.0,15:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2829,11,2,T1 ,so let's do a step by step,,15:24.0,15:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2830,11,2,T1 ,remember these are negatives,,15:26.0,15:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2831,11,2,T1 ,,yup so that maybe we have to oh wait,15:28.0,15:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2832,11,2,T1 ,,so first we subtract y I think,15:31.0,15:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2833,11,2,T1 ,wait there is no equal sign what the heck,,15:35.0,15:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2834,11,2,T1 ,,well it's just equals sign,15:38.0,15:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2835,11,2,T1 ,oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I thought it was subtraction,,15:40.0,15:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2836,11,2,T1 ,got it yeah that's equal,,15:42.0,15:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2837,11,2,T1 ,,all right pause filler yeah it's kind of weird well so,15:44.0,15:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2838,11,2,T1 ,it's like what kind of math is this,,15:48.0,15:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2839,11,2,T1 ,,yeah what kind of witchcraft is this,15:50.0,15:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2840,11,2,T1 ,,pause filler so yeah I think it's subtract the y,15:51.0,15:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2841,11,2,T1 ,yeah subtract the y first,,15:55.0,15:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2842,11,2,T1 ,,so that means pause filler if you like negative wait thirteen negative thirteen over seven y,15:56.0,16:03.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2843,11,2,T1 ,,yup I think,16:03.0,16:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2844,11,2,T1 ,pause filler,,16:03.0,16:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2845,11,2,T1 ,,I'm pretty sure that's right,16:04.0,16:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2846,11,2,T1 ,,thirteen over seven y equals okay well,16:07.0,16:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2847,11,2,T1 ,,so we're going to add sixty-one,16:13.0,16:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2848,11,2,T1 ,,so twelve times twenty-five is eighty-seven oh no eighty-six,16:14.0,16:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2849,11,2,T1 ,,it's (inaudible) for that,16:18.0,16:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2850,11,2,T1 ,eighty-six,,16:19.0,16:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2851,11,2,T1 ,,eighty-six,16:20.0,16:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2852,11,2,T1 ,,,16:20.0,20:36.0,04:16.0,,,,,,
2853,11,2,T1 ,yeah add that yup eighty-six,,16:20.0,16:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2854,11,2,T1 ,that's good that's good,,16:23.0,16:24.0,00:01.0,,,UL,,,
2855,11,2,T1 ,you got everything it correctly,,16:24.0,16:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2856,11,2,T1 ,,so we're going to multiply it by pause filler eighty-six,16:24.0,16:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2857,11,2,T1 ,the reciprocal is going to be negative,,16:27.0,16:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2858,11,2,T1 ,,wait (inaudible) something it's two hundred forty-five divided by twelve oh shit,16:29.0,16:36.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
2859,11,2,T1 ,I can't do it if I'm at this page,,16:38.0,16:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2860,11,2,T1 ,,it would be divide,16:41.0,16:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2861,11,2,T1 ,I think you got this problem right if you just multiply,,16:42.0,16:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2862,11,2,T1 ,,no I'm going to multiply it by twelve,16:44.0,16:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2863,11,2,T1 ,if you just multiply the reciprocal,,16:45.0,16:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2864,11,2,T1 ,,it's negative five over twelve then,16:47.0,16:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2865,11,2,T1 ,,I didn't do it over twelve,16:48.0,16:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2866,11,2,T1 ,,so we'll just add the over twelve there,16:49.0,16:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2867,11,2,T1 ,pause filler but just add the reciprocal,,16:52.0,16:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2868,11,2,T1 ,so we'll do seven times,,16:55.0,16:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2869,11,2,T1 ,just do that first,,16:57.0,16:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2870,11,2,T1 ,and then just divide it by thirteen,,16:59.0,17:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2871,11,2,T1 ,,yup so pause filler let's see eighty-six,17:00.0,17:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2872,11,2,T1 ,and we can just leave that as in like,,17:06.0,17:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2873,11,2,T1 ,you divide it by thirteen,,17:08.0,17:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2874,11,2,T1 ,,yup so seven times six is forty-two apparently,17:09.0,17:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2875,11,2,T1 ,,pause filler seven time eight is pause filler,17:13.0,17:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2876,11,2,T1 ,,wait no seven times eight is forty-two,17:18.0,17:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2877,11,2,T1 ,,wait no it's fifty-six fifty-six fifty-six fifty-six yeah,17:20.0,17:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2878,11,2,T1 ,fifty-six wait yeah,,17:27.0,17:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2879,11,2,T1 ,,all right and then well I would need zero,17:29.0,17:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2880,11,2,T1 ,,so that means that this would be off,17:31.0,17:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2881,11,2,T1 ,,but I don't okay fine pause filler what oh yeah,17:35.0,17:41.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2882,11,2,T1 ,,this would be a zero,17:41.0,17:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2883,11,2,T1 ,,and this would be a six six over two it's,17:43.0,17:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2884,11,2,T1 ,,I mean that y equals six o two over thirteen,17:47.0,17:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2885,11,2,T1 ,how did you get the four okay all right twelve sixteen,,17:52.0,17:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2886,11,2,T1 ,,I would definitely like just write this out,17:58.0,18:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2887,11,2,T1 ,,let me see seven times eighty-six right okay,18:01.0,18:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2888,11,2,T1 ,,yeah I have to keep going on seven okay pause filler seven,18:04.0,18:14.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
2889,11,2,T1 ,let's see if you do this right,,18:15.0,18:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2890,11,2,T1 ,,times wait no,18:18.0,18:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2891,11,2,T1 ,eight times seven seven times six,,18:21.0,18:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2892,11,2,T1 ,,sixty-eight was it,18:26.0,18:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2893,11,2,T1 ,six times six is thirty-six and another six,,18:29.0,18:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2894,11,2,T1 ,and you would get forty-two,,18:32.0,18:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2895,11,2,T1 ,,what's the number,18:36.0,18:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2896,11,2,T1 ,forty-two is six,,18:37.0,18:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2897,11,2,T1 ,,it's six here we go pause filler so eighty-six yeah,18:39.0,18:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2898,11,2,T1 ,yeah forty-two and then you get seven time twelve,,18:43.0,18:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2899,11,2,T1 ,,damn it so difficult to use,18:47.0,18:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2900,11,2,T1 ,,I would prefer a mouse but pause filler it's,18:51.0,18:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2901,11,2,T1 ,wait (inaudible),,18:55.0,18:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2902,11,2,T1 ,,yeah six oh two,18:55.0,18:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2903,11,2,T1 ,six o two and then just do two two two,,18:56.0,18:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2904,11,2,T1 ,,positive,18:58.0,19:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2905,11,2,T1 ,y equals six over two equals thirteen,,19:00.0,19:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2906,11,2,T1 ,,oh yeah that's all I wrote,19:06.0,19:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2907,11,2,T1 ,,that's all I wrote up here yeah pause filler but okay,19:07.0,19:13.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2908,11,2,T1 ,next one all right this is negative all right,,19:14.0,19:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2909,11,2,T1 ,,yup a bunch of negatives here pause filler yup so pause filler,19:18.0,19:22.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2910,11,2,T1 ,you can get this out of the way or no,,19:22.0,19:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2911,11,2,T1 ,we could it the other way around what's that,,19:24.0,19:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2912,11,2,T1 ,you want to start on,,19:27.0,19:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2913,11,2,T1 ,what do you think is here,,19:28.0,19:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2914,11,2,T1 ,,I think we should move the x over negative five,19:31.0,19:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2915,11,2,T1 ,,so I think we should pause filler should probably,19:35.0,19:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2916,11,2,T1 ,to the right side of left side,,19:37.0,19:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2917,11,2,T1 ,,to the right side,19:40.0,19:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2918,11,2,T1 ,okay so then we just add twelve I mean,,19:40.0,19:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2919,11,2,T1 ,,so yeah we can subtract seventeen,19:42.0,19:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2920,11,2,T1 ,subtract seventeen then yeah,,19:45.0,19:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2921,11,2,T1 ,,okay so subtracting seventeen we would get pause filler negative ninety no negative hundred negative a hundred,19:47.0,19:55.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2922,11,2,T1 ,right yup negative one hundred,,19:55.0,19:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2923,11,2,T1 ,,negative one hundred equals let's see pause filler,19:58.0,20:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2924,11,2,T1 ,,it would be forty-three,20:03.0,20:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2925,11,2,T1 ,,because we're moving over to the eleven six,20:06.0,20:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2926,11,2,T1 ,,so if we subtract eleven we just multiply,20:10.0,20:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2927,11,2,T1 ,thirty-three,,20:12.0,20:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2928,11,2,T1 ,,yeah,20:14.0,20:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2929,11,2,T1 ,and then you would get pause filler twenty-one,,20:14.0,20:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2930,11,2,T1 ,,that's forty-three right no,20:17.0,20:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2931,11,2,T1 ,,because we're adding it,20:18.0,20:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2932,11,2,T1 ,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah you're adding yeah yeah so forty-three,,20:19.0,20:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2933,11,2,T1 ,,so forty-three forty-three over three x,20:22.0,20:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2934,11,2,T1 ,so negative one hundred equals forty-three over three x,,20:26.0,20:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2935,11,2,T1 ,,all right so negative one hundred pause filler so negative one hundred time three over forty-three so negative a hundred time three is negative three hundred over forty-three equals x,20:29.0,20:52.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
2936,11,2,T1 ,,,20:36.0,22:30.0,01:54.0,,,,,,
2937,11,2,T1 ,I'll see if you do that right yup,,20:54.0,20:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2938,11,2,T1 ,and then just yup yup that's correct nine all right,,20:56.0,21:04.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2939,11,2,T1 ,pause filler let's do the same thing that we did last time,,21:04.0,21:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2940,11,2,T1 ,and just get this on the left side,,21:06.0,21:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2941,11,2,T1 ,,yeah it would be easier though so fourteen times four,21:09.0,21:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2942,11,2,T1 ,,let's see fourteen times four,21:13.0,21:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2943,11,2,T1 ,,so we're like we'll do it fourteen four so sixteen thirty-one fifty-six,21:15.0,21:23.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
2944,11,2,T1 ,so fifty-six,,21:23.0,21:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2945,11,2,T1 ,,yup makes sense because it's seven times eight,21:24.0,21:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2946,11,2,T1 ,yeah,,21:28.0,21:28.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2947,11,2,T1 ,,yeah wait no I don't know yeah yeah yeah yeah right,21:30.0,21:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2948,11,2,T1 ,yeah you're right,,21:32.0,21:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2949,11,2,T1 ,you're right,,21:33.0,21:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2950,11,2,T1 ,,okay fifty-six so I mean it could be minus nineteen minus fifty-six over four pause filler,21:33.0,21:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2951,11,2,T1 ,no it's just fifty-six minus nineteen,,21:40.0,21:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2952,11,2,T1 ,,no ninety-six over pause filler nineteen minus fifty-six because we're subtract fourteen y,21:45.0,21:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2953,11,2,T1 ,I'll just write this out really quickly because here,,21:50.0,21:56.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2954,11,2,T1 ,once you get here left over is three and then three so thirty-three,,21:56.0,22:02.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2955,11,2,T1 ,,so negative thirty-three because we're subtracting yeah okay okay pause filler,22:03.0,22:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2956,11,2,T1 ,so negative thirty-three,,22:07.0,22:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2957,11,2,T1 ,,yeah plus fifty-five so we should get that to the other side,22:10.0,22:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2958,11,2,T1 ,and it's over y right I mean over four right,,22:13.0,22:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2959,11,2,T1 ,,yup all right and then we add fifty or sorry subtract fifty-five so then thirty-five minus thirty-four pause filler,22:16.0,22:28.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
2960,11,2,T1 ,so nineteen or,,22:28.0,22:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2961,11,2,T1 ,,it's one twenty-one,22:29.0,22:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2962,11,2,T1 ,,,22:30.0,25:10.0,02:40.0,,,,,,
2963,11,2,T1 ,,so it would be negative twenty-one,22:31.0,22:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2964,11,2,T1 ,,so negative thirty-three over four y equals twenty-one okay twenty-one okay,22:33.0,22:48.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
2965,11,2,T1 ,,and that means that we just have to subtract or multiply by twenty-one times pause filler four over negative three,22:48.0,23:01.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
2966,11,2,T1 ,,because we can cancel out the negatives so yeah,23:01.0,23:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2967,11,2,T1 ,yeah you just cancel out the negative,,23:04.0,23:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2968,11,2,T1 ,so the negative is not on the variable,,23:06.0,23:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2969,11,2,T1 ,,yup eighty-four,23:09.0,23:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2970,11,2,T1 ,eighty-four yup that is in the middle,,23:11.0,23:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2971,11,2,T1 ,,eighty-four over thirty,23:13.0,23:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2972,11,2,T1 ,yup negative so,,23:15.0,23:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2973,11,2,T1 ,,equals y no not negative because you have to cancel out the negative on the y and on the negative over there,23:17.0,23:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
2974,11,2,T1 ,because they're both negatives,,23:23.0,23:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2975,11,2,T1 ,,yeah,23:24.0,23:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
2976,11,2,T1 ,yeah so they're both negatives,,23:25.0,23:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2977,11,2,T1 ,yup you just multiply them by negative one and then,,23:26.0,23:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2978,11,2,T1 ,,I think we did that right,23:29.0,23:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2979,11,2,T1 ,yup good job next one,,23:30.0,23:33.0,00:03.0,,,UL,,,
2980,11,2,T1 ,,forty-four,23:33.0,23:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2981,11,2,T1 ,oh it's a big one again,,23:34.0,23:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2982,11,2,T1 ,I think we should just start off again the seven pause filler to the other side,,23:35.0,23:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
2983,11,2,T1 ,,wait maybe we can like simplify this,23:40.0,23:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2984,11,2,T1 ,,what can we divide all these things by that would make them simpler,23:43.0,23:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2985,11,2,T1 ,,can we divide this by eleven,23:47.0,23:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2986,11,2,T1 ,no we can divide it by seven right no,,23:48.0,23:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2987,11,2,T1 ,,what else you could do,23:51.0,23:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2988,11,2,T1 ,yeah but wait can we do two hundred two by eleven though,,23:53.0,23:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2989,11,2,T1 ,,pause filler I think so wait,23:57.0,24:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2990,11,2,T1 ,oh we can't get this divided by eleven,,24:00.0,24:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2991,11,2,T1 ,,it has to be pause filler zero would have to be two plus two,24:04.0,24:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2992,11,2,T1 ,,I think two forty-two is out of this,24:06.0,24:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
2993,11,2,T1 ,anyway it seems like this answer is going to be like it does to multiple for,,24:08.0,24:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2994,11,2,T1 ,it's going to be a big fraction,,24:11.0,24:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2995,11,2,T1 ,so that's going to be messy I will,,24:12.0,24:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
2996,11,2,T1 ,,actually manager stopped working oh shit pause filler,24:15.0,24:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
2997,11,2,T1 ,,is this still working,24:20.0,24:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2998,11,2,T1 ,,is it still working,24:21.0,24:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
2999,11,2,T1 ,,do you see this stuff on you,24:22.0,24:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3000,11,2,T1 ,yup I see that,,24:23.0,24:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3001,11,2,T1 ,,that's good,24:24.0,24:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3002,11,2,T1 ,,I wonder what is breaking on my computer,24:25.0,24:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3003,11,2,T1 ,,no I don't want a lot more problem,24:28.0,24:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3004,11,2,T1 ,,hey can you can I just stop this video,24:32.0,24:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3005,11,2,T1 ,,is anything still working,24:38.0,24:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3006,11,2,T1 ,,do you see that,24:40.0,24:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3007,11,2,T1 ,everything is working can you,,24:41.0,24:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3008,11,2,T1 ,,we're good to go kind of weird pause filler okay so,24:43.0,24:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3009,11,2,T1 ,,okay let's move to seventy-seven over yup seventy-seven times fourteen oh god well seventy-seven times fourteen,24:46.0,25:02.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
3010,11,2,T1 ,seven pause filler I got a calculator,,25:02.0,25:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3011,11,2,T1 ,,well I can use (inaudible),25:09.0,25:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3012,11,2,T1 ,,,25:10.0,28:04.0,02:54.0,,,,,,
3013,11,2,T1 ,,four times seven is pause filler twenty-eight eight negative two,25:10.0,25:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3014,11,2,T1 ,,four times seven is twenty-eight and zero three three hundred eight plus on zero seventy-seven,25:15.0,25:22.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3015,11,2,T1 ,,so it would be eight seven over one thousand seventy-eight,25:22.0,25:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3016,11,2,T1 ,well well done,,25:28.0,25:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3017,11,2,T1 ,one thousand seven hundred over fourteen equals,,25:29.0,25:34.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3018,11,2,T1 ,,pause filler (inaudible),25:30.0,25:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3019,11,2,T1 ,,oh wait it would be no no no no no a hundred,25:35.0,25:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3020,11,2,T1 ,,we're sub acting from fifty,25:38.0,25:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3021,11,2,T1 ,wait,,25:41.0,25:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3022,11,2,T1 ,,or we can just subtract fifty on like that wait (inaudible),25:42.0,25:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3023,11,2,T1 ,yeah that's what we subtract from fifty yup so,,25:49.0,25:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3024,11,2,T1 ,,yup all right so fifty or that would just be one zero two eight all right,25:53.0,26:02.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3025,11,2,T1 ,,and that would be negative so good,26:02.0,26:05.0,00:03.0,,,,UL,,
3026,11,2,T1 ,,it's three forty-four equals two hundred two plus,26:05.0,26:12.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3027,11,2,T1 ,it's just one forty-two,,26:12.0,26:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3028,11,2,T1 ,,huh oh good good,26:17.0,26:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3029,11,2,T1 ,,anything we have happening in your side oh,26:22.0,26:28.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3030,11,2,T1 ,,because yeah something happened on my side,26:28.0,26:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3031,11,2,T1 ,,the computer said something about connection manager solving the work,26:33.0,26:40.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3032,11,2,T1 ,,I thought it would like mess something up,26:40.0,26:45.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3033,11,2,T1 ,,but we seem to be able to go on just fine,26:45.0,26:54.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3034,11,2,T1 ,,yup,27:40.0,27:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

3036,11,2,T1 ,sure,,28:22.0,28:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3037,11,2,T1 ,(inaudible) bites,,28:48.0,28:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3038,11,2,T1 ,,I've never seen you before broken eat less,28:49.0,29:19.0,00:30.0,,,,,,SD
3039,11,2,S2 ,,,29:04.0,34:24.0,05:20.0,,,,,,
3040,11,2,S2 ,,yup and the (inaudible),29:19.0,29:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3041,11,2,S2 ,so what do you like to do for your free time,,29:23.0,29:29.0,00:06.0,,,,,,QE
3042,11,2,S2 ,,game,29:30.0,29:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,SD,
3043,11,2,S2 ,nice,,29:33.0,29:33.0,00:00.0,,,,UL,,
3044,11,2,S2 ,,yeah (inaudible) program and evolutionary big games simulations I have simulations,29:33.0,29:40.0,00:07.0,,,,,SD,
3045,11,2,S2 ,what games do you play,,29:40.0,29:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,QE
3046,11,2,S2 ,or what game is that,,29:42.0,29:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3047,11,2,S2 ,,you can do it but never know pause filler on (inaudible) which I couldn't get to work for like a year now,29:44.0,29:57.0,00:13.0,,,,,SD,
3048,11,2,S2 ,,I don't know how to use it,29:57.0,29:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,SD,
3049,11,2,S2 ,,and pause filler things that are a little more in the gaming end are kind of like (inaudible),29:58.0,30:04.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3050,11,2,S2 ,,it's a good natural select simulator definitely could be used in your class,30:04.0,30:24.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
3051,11,2,S2 ,nice,,30:24.0,30:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3052,11,2,S2 ,,(inaudible) my teacher,30:26.0,30:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3053,11,2,S2 ,yeah it is very interesting how like natural selection work and stuff like that,,30:31.0,30:55.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
3054,11,2,S2 ,,yeah (inaudible),30:56.0,30:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3055,11,2,S2 ,,hard to observe in this kind of reality,31:00.0,31:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3056,11,2,S2 ,,because pause filler things tend to live a long time annoying you for a long time,31:09.0,31:19.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3057,11,2,S2 ,well and the changes are pretty slow,,31:19.0,31:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3058,11,2,S2 ,,yeah well the reason they're still slow is because everything is really ridiculous in long time bacteria,31:23.0,31:33.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3059,11,2,S2 ,,it's easy to find the (inaudible),31:33.0,31:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3060,11,2,S2 ,,and I have (inaudible) frequently to get resistant to antibiotics that we used (inaudible) yeah,31:35.0,31:45.0,00:10.0,,,,,SD,
3061,11,2,S2 ,has there been any like recent like diseases that like we're immune to now,,31:46.0,31:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3062,11,2,S2 ,or is there anything like same things like that where like we are immune to now but we are like,,31:51.0,31:59.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3063,11,2,S2 ,,susceptible looks like it's going to start hey,32:02.0,32:14.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
3064,11,2,S2 ,,oh I'll make sure not to do that,32:35.0,32:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3065,11,2,S2 ,all righty hi there thanks,,32:38.0,32:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3066,11,2,S2 ,pause filler let's see it's on black,,32:48.0,32:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3067,11,2,S2 ,thanks,,32:53.0,32:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3068,11,2,S2 ,all right,,32:55.0,32:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3069,11,2,S2 ,,yeah (inaudible) interesting pause filler I guess you could do this two ways,32:56.0,33:07.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
3070,11,2,S2 ,,you could pause filler reciprocal everything,33:08.0,33:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3071,11,2,S2 ,,or you could multiply it by x,33:13.0,33:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3072,11,2,S2 ,,and then divide it by twenty-five,33:15.0,33:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3073,11,2,S2 ,,I recommend just reciprocaling everything,33:18.0,33:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3074,11,2,S2 ,,it's the same thing but you just yeah,33:19.0,33:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3075,11,2,S2 ,all right let's do that,,33:23.0,33:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3076,11,2,S2 ,,so basically you're seeing the process right,33:26.0,33:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3077,11,2,S2 ,yeah,,33:31.0,33:31.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3078,11,2,S2 ,,you multiply x which make this five x,33:32.0,33:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3079,11,2,S2 ,,and you just move this back to where the x was,33:37.0,33:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3080,11,2,S2 ,,because that makes it reciprocal basically,33:41.0,33:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3081,11,2,S2 ,so it would be point five x,,33:44.0,33:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3082,11,2,S2 ,,equals one and then you divide it by thirty-one,33:48.0,33:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3083,11,2,S2 ,,and then it would be going to,33:51.0,33:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3084,11,2,S2 ,and then you get x equals one over twenty-five,,33:56.0,34:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3085,11,2,S2 ,,yup all right negative thirty over y minus seventeen equals,34:01.0,34:12.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
3086,11,2,S2 ,,it looks like that's where the equal signs,34:12.0,34:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3087,11,2,S2 ,yeah I'll (inaudible) so,,34:16.0,34:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3088,11,2,S2 ,,yeah (inaudible),34:17.0,34:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3089,11,2,S2 ,add something,,34:18.0,34:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3090,11,2,S2 ,,good that would be pause filler,34:19.0,34:22.0,00:03.0,,,UL,,,
3091,11,2,S2 ,eighty,,34:22.0,34:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3092,11,2,S2 ,,yup and now I guess you could reciprocal it,34:23.0,34:35.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
3093,11,2,S2 ,mm-hmm wow so two hundred negative two hundred forty over y,,34:35.0,35:00.0,00:25.0,,,,,,
3094,11,2,S2 ,,yup,35:04.0,35:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3095,11,2,S2 ,and equals negative three,,35:09.0,35:16.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3096,11,2,T2 ,,,35:11.0,53:00.0,17:49.0,,,,,,
3097,11,2,T2 ,,,35:12.0,36:25.0,01:13.0,,,,,,
3098,11,2,T2 ,,wait actually I'm not sure about that,35:17.0,35:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3099,11,2,T2 ,wait equal like,,35:19.0,35:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3100,11,2,T2 ,,I'm not sure about that entire process,35:21.0,35:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3101,11,2,T2 ,,because if you can't multiply that you'd be dividing that,35:23.0,35:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3102,11,2,T2 ,yeah yeah it will be one x so,,35:28.0,35:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3103,11,2,T2 ,I mean y,,35:32.0,35:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3104,11,2,T2 ,and then we'll just,,35:35.0,35:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3105,11,2,T2 ,oh and then we would multiply it to both sides,,35:39.0,35:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3106,11,2,T2 ,,there's number two,35:46.0,35:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3107,11,2,T2 ,I think I did something wrong,,35:50.0,35:56.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3108,11,2,T2 ,,yeah,35:57.0,35:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3109,11,2,T2 ,oh I know I did wrong I pause filler,,35:58.0,36:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3110,11,2,T2 ,,you can just divide it by negative three,36:00.0,36:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3111,11,2,T2 ,no I did it yeah you divide it by negative three by eight,,36:02.0,36:08.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3112,11,2,T2 ,yeah I forgot to switch it though,,36:08.0,36:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3113,11,2,T2 ,,well maybe yeah,36:10.0,36:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3114,11,2,T2 ,yeah you see I'm supposed to do,,36:12.0,36:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3115,11,2,T2 ,,I guess it would just be y equals negative three divided by eighty,36:14.0,36:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3116,11,2,T2 ,yeah,,36:19.0,36:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3117,11,2,T2 ,,that was way more complicated than this,36:21.0,36:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3118,11,2,T2 ,,,36:25.0,40:13.0,03:48.0,,,,,,
3119,11,2,T2 ,yup and then we got pause filler twenty well,,36:26.0,36:35.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3120,11,2,T2 ,you don't get twenty fifteen,,36:40.0,36:46.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3121,11,2,T2 ,what's eighty divided by three twenty-four,,36:47.0,36:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3122,11,2,T2 ,,no I can actually probably look it up pause filler eighty oh god damn it okay oh no equals negative twenty-six point six is six,36:50.0,37:26.0,00:36.0,,,,,,
3123,11,2,T2 ,,I don't think it can be simplified,37:26.0,37:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3124,11,2,T2 ,divided by seven,,37:32.0,37:41.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3125,11,2,T2 ,,yup nope I think I have to go there okay,37:41.0,37:54.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
3126,11,2,T2 ,,pause filler okay I've scratched up fifty-four and pause filler,37:55.0,37:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3127,11,2,T2 ,,let's see how you do it pause filler,37:59.0,38:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3128,11,2,T2 ,,and five minus eleven is six right,38:03.0,38:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3129,11,2,T2 ,sixty-two,,38:07.0,38:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3130,11,2,T2 ,,yup I'm not recognizing my candy like a weird OCD person,38:08.0,38:21.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
3131,11,2,T2 ,and then multiply it by both sides sixty-two k divided by four,,38:21.0,38:29.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3132,11,2,T2 ,,yup that sounds good,38:31.0,38:34.0,00:03.0,,,UL,,,
3133,11,2,T2 ,and then four divided to sixty-two would it be fifteen times no thirty-two,,38:34.0,38:46.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
3134,11,2,T2 ,,what sixty-two,38:48.0,38:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3135,11,2,T2 ,yup six eighteen times,,38:50.0,38:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3136,11,2,T2 ,,sixteen,38:53.0,38:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3137,11,2,T2 ,sixteen times,,38:54.0,38:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3138,11,2,T2 ,,wait sixty-four or sixty-eight,38:57.0,38:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3139,11,2,T2 ,sixty-four,,38:59.0,38:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3140,11,2,T2 ,,and how about that number four,39:00.0,39:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3141,11,2,T2 ,by four,,39:03.0,39:03.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3142,11,2,T2 ,,sixteen,39:07.0,39:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3143,11,2,T2 ,with that k equals sixteen,,39:09.0,39:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3144,11,2,T2 ,,is that right,39:11.0,39:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3145,11,2,T2 ,,I think so,39:13.0,39:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3146,11,2,T2 ,yeah that's why you're supposed to get k,,39:15.0,39:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3147,11,2,T2 ,,wait isn't that sixty-two over there,39:17.0,39:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3148,11,2,T2 ,yeah it is so,,39:20.0,39:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3149,11,2,T2 ,,it placed sixty-four oh well,39:22.0,39:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3150,11,2,T2 ,,no then I don't think it does,39:24.0,39:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3151,11,2,T2 ,well compute on sixty-four,,39:28.0,39:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3152,11,2,T2 ,so it will be like fifteen point yeah,,39:32.0,39:40.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3153,11,2,T2 ,,I would leave you with one over k equals sixty-two over four,39:40.0,39:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3154,11,2,T2 ,are we even doing this right,,39:46.0,39:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3155,11,2,T2 ,I feel like we're doing something wrong,,39:47.0,39:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3156,11,2,T2 ,,yeah,39:49.0,39:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3157,11,2,T2 ,because like we get sixty-two,,39:50.0,39:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3158,11,2,T2 ,,it gets difficult when you don't have like a calculator now,39:56.0,39:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3159,11,2,T2 ,,because then you spend so much time looking up on the map,39:58.0,40:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3160,11,2,T2 ,,and it's hard to do in the algebra,40:02.0,40:09.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3161,11,2,T2 ,okay,,40:09.0,40:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3162,11,2,T2 ,,sixty divided by four could be simplified to thirty-one divided by two,40:10.0,40:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3163,11,2,T2 ,,,40:13.0,43:24.0,03:11.0,,,,,,
3164,11,2,T2 ,,and that's simplified again,40:13.0,40:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3165,11,2,T2 ,,so one over k equals thirty-one over two,40:15.0,40:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3166,11,2,T2 ,,which means that k equals thirty-two one over thirty-two but no yes,40:18.0,40:24.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3167,11,2,T2 ,oh yeah yeah yeah because we can just,,40:24.0,40:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3168,11,2,T2 ,,no two over thirty-one two over thirty-one there we go,40:26.0,40:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3169,11,2,T2 ,so k equals two over thirty-one,,40:29.0,40:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3170,11,2,T2 ,because that's the possible (inaudible) in that scenario,,40:31.0,40:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3171,11,2,T2 ,,yeah,40:35.0,40:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3172,11,2,T2 ,yup yeah I forgot about that,,40:35.0,40:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3173,11,2,T2 ,we could just where we're used fraction,,40:37.0,40:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3174,11,2,T2 ,all right let's move on so this,,40:40.0,40:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3175,11,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),40:42.0,40:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3176,11,2,T2 ,,we could just divide by negative fourteen,40:44.0,40:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3177,11,2,T2 ,mm-hmm,,40:45.0,40:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3178,11,2,T2 ,no no it's what I'm supposed to do,,40:50.0,40:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3179,11,2,T2 ,,what does it say to do,40:55.0,40:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3180,11,2,T2 ,,which one is this,40:56.0,40:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3181,11,2,T2 ,yeah,,40:57.0,40:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3182,11,2,T2 ,,definitely multiply both sides by x,40:58.0,41:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3183,11,2,T2 ,,but you can also just like divide it by fourteen and then,41:02.0,41:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3184,11,2,T2 ,that's what you get,,41:06.0,41:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3185,11,2,T2 ,,yeah and then you get one (inaudible) reciprocal,41:09.0,41:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3186,11,2,T2 ,all right so pause filler multiply by both sides pause filler no calculator two hundred and ten divided by fourteen,,41:13.0,41:28.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
3187,11,2,T2 ,,pause filler they can both be reduced by seven,41:28.0,41:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3188,11,2,T2 ,,so that would be the same thing as pause filler thirty over two fifteen,41:34.0,41:41.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3189,11,2,T2 ,yeah if we reduce it by seven because seven keep going,,41:41.0,41:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3190,11,2,T2 ,,fourteen twice and two hundred ten thirty times I believe it's thirty over two pause filler fifteen,41:46.0,41:58.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
3191,11,2,T2 ,so yeah so fifteen so y equals fifteen,,41:59.0,42:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3192,11,2,T2 ,,yup no one over y equals fifteen,42:03.0,42:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3193,11,2,T2 ,one,,42:08.0,42:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3194,11,2,T2 ,,so y equals fourteen over fifteen,42:10.0,42:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3195,11,2,T2 ,,I'm pretty sure,42:11.0,42:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3196,11,2,T2 ,so y equals negative fifteen,,42:12.0,42:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3197,11,2,T2 ,,yeah no y over no pause filler y equals negative one over fifteen,42:14.0,42:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3198,11,2,T2 ,,because with the reciprocal of the y you have the reciprocal of fifteen too,42:21.0,42:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3199,11,2,T2 ,yeah yeah yeah,,42:24.0,42:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3200,11,2,T2 ,,and that's I guess what you end up with,42:28.0,42:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3201,11,2,T2 ,you have to reciprocal everything all right over five let's see,,42:30.0,42:37.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3202,11,2,T2 ,,hundred thirteen equals five over x,42:38.0,42:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3203,11,2,T2 ,,so I definitely get that to the other side so thirty-two seven,42:41.0,42:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3204,11,2,T2 ,you add it,,42:46.0,42:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3205,11,2,T2 ,so one thirty-seven equals over x,,42:47.0,42:59.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
3206,11,2,T2 ,and then multiply the reciprocal,,42:59.0,43:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3207,11,2,T2 ,,I guess one,43:01.0,43:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3208,11,2,T2 ,,you divide it by five,43:02.0,43:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3209,11,2,T2 ,or yeah it's technically what you're doing anyway,,43:04.0,43:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3210,11,2,T2 ,well then I think that's all you got for one twenty yes,,43:07.0,43:13.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3211,11,2,T2 ,,divide by five and then,43:13.0,43:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3212,11,2,T2 ,I don't think you can simplify,,43:15.0,43:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3213,11,2,T2 ,,so x equals pause filler five over a hundred (inaudible),43:16.0,43:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3214,11,2,T2 ,yeah,,43:20.0,43:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3215,11,2,T2 ,,no no it's the other way around,43:24.0,43:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3216,11,2,T2 ,,,43:24.0,45:22.0,01:58.0,,,,,,
3217,11,2,T2 ,,because right now right now this is true one,43:27.0,43:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3218,11,2,T2 ,,or yeah this is true right now,43:30.0,43:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3219,11,2,T2 ,,you have to make it so the x is on top,43:33.0,43:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3220,11,2,T2 ,,so it's a whole number,43:35.0,43:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3221,11,2,T2 ,,you have to make it so that x equals five over (inaudible),43:37.0,43:43.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3222,11,2,T2 ,oh huh,,43:43.0,43:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3223,11,2,T2 ,,x equals five over a hundred and five,43:46.0,43:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3224,11,2,T2 ,oh yeah yeah a whole number,,43:49.0,43:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3225,11,2,T2 ,,yeah because of the Ys its x is over one,43:53.0,43:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3226,11,2,T2 ,,hey what do you have here,43:58.0,44:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3227,11,2,T2 ,pause filler what would be easier,,44:00.0,44:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3228,11,2,T2 ,,I think it would be easier,44:03.0,44:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3229,11,2,T2 ,,they're both over x,44:05.0,44:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3230,11,2,T2 ,,so it would be easier to move pause filler the smaller one to the other side,44:07.0,44:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3231,11,2,T2 ,,so I think we should move three x to the right three over x to the right,44:10.0,44:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3232,11,2,T2 ,and that would be yeah yeah,,44:14.0,44:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3233,11,2,T2 ,,and that would be fifteen over x,44:15.0,44:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3234,11,2,T2 ,,and if we move eleven to the other side by negative in it (inaudible) now pause filler,44:20.0,44:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3235,11,2,T2 ,it would be positive,,44:26.0,44:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3236,11,2,T2 ,,no we got,44:28.0,44:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3237,11,2,T2 ,oh yeah so go to the left,,44:30.0,44:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3238,11,2,T2 ,so I mean it's only negative but,,44:33.0,44:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3239,11,2,T2 ,,yup between negative a hundred and twelve,44:35.0,44:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3240,11,2,T2 ,yeah thirteen,,44:39.0,44:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3241,11,2,T2 ,,wait now I think it would just be a hundred and three,44:42.0,44:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3242,11,2,T2 ,yeah a hundred and three and pause filler just multiply the reciprocal,,44:46.0,44:54.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3243,11,2,T2 ,so you're just dividing by fifteen,,44:55.0,44:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3244,11,2,T2 ,,yup and then you're moving the x over,44:58.0,45:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3245,11,2,T2 ,I think you're done right,,45:00.0,45:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3246,11,2,T2 ,,well yeah but you also have to do pause filler put,45:01.0,45:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3247,11,2,T2 ,,so the x is on top,45:05.0,45:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3248,11,2,T2 ,,which means x equals fifteen,45:08.0,45:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3249,11,2,T2 ,over negative one o three,,45:10.0,45:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3250,11,2,T2 ,,yeah negative one o three oh,45:11.0,45:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3251,11,2,T2 ,,okay I think I'm giving you the answers,45:12.0,45:19.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3252,11,2,T2 ,well I could write down the answers,,45:19.0,45:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3253,11,2,T2 ,,yeah I'll just get rid of all that (sfx),45:22.0,45:30.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3254,11,2,T2 ,,,45:23.0,46:53.0,01:30.0,,,,,,
3255,11,2,T2 ,,there we go,45:30.0,45:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3256,11,2,T2 ,thanks,,45:31.0,45:31.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3257,11,2,T2 ,,they're all got rid of,45:32.0,45:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3258,11,2,T2 ,fifteen I mean I understand negative one three,,45:34.0,45:42.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3259,11,2,T2 ,pause filler let's see,,45:42.0,45:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3260,11,2,T2 ,let's do this pause filler,,45:43.0,45:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3261,11,2,T2 ,,it could be easier again to,45:45.0,45:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3262,11,2,T2 ,,oh crap we're wrong,45:48.0,45:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3263,11,2,T2 ,for the last one,,45:49.0,45:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3264,11,2,T2 ,,no yeah for the last one because we'd be subtracting it,45:52.0,45:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3265,11,2,T2 ,,it would mean pause filler nine over pause filler x equals nine over a hundred and three,45:55.0,46:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3266,11,2,T2 ,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right,,46:01.0,46:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3267,11,2,T2 ,,oh we almost made that mistake,46:04.0,46:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3268,11,2,T2 ,oh shoot yeah because we added it yeah,,46:06.0,46:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3269,11,2,T2 ,because yeah there's a positive there,,46:08.0,46:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3270,11,2,T2 ,so you should be subtracting it oh crap,,46:10.0,46:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3271,11,2,T2 ,so nine it would just,,46:12.0,46:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3272,11,2,T2 ,,I don't think that changes any of our,46:14.0,46:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3273,11,2,T2 ,yeah we'll just change fifteen to a nine,,46:16.0,46:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3274,11,2,T2 ,that's all we do,,46:18.0,46:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3275,11,2,T2 ,,yup nine there we go,46:18.0,46:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3276,11,2,T2 ,I got it,,46:19.0,46:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3277,11,2,T2 ,,yeah,46:21.0,46:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3278,11,2,T2 ,let's see if I can just go back go back go back go back go back go back nine over negative one over three yeah those negatives man we're almost true yup,,46:21.0,46:37.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
3279,11,2,T2 ,,(inaudible) man,46:37.0,46:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3280,11,2,T2 ,all right so yes pause filler we got to subtract,,46:37.0,46:42.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3281,11,2,T2 ,,oh yeah so we're going to move this,46:42.0,46:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3282,11,2,T2 ,,make sure we don't have to make the same mistakes,46:43.0,46:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3283,11,2,T2 ,,so make sure it's eight over x,46:45.0,46:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3284,11,2,T2 ,eight over x equals,,46:47.0,46:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3285,11,2,T2 ,,oh and this one is nice because again,46:52.0,46:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3286,11,2,T2 ,,,46:53.0,49:41.0,02:48.0,,,,,,
3287,11,2,T2 ,,because we'll have positive numbers on both sides,46:54.0,46:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3288,11,2,T2 ,this is true,,46:57.0,46:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3289,11,2,T2 ,this is very true,,46:58.0,46:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3290,11,2,T2 ,,so we can subtract the twenty-five,46:59.0,47:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3291,11,2,T2 ,,add sixty minus twenty-five is pause filler forty-five,47:01.0,47:08.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3292,11,2,T2 ,I think one twenty-five,,47:08.0,47:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3293,11,2,T2 ,,I think it's forty-five,47:11.0,47:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3294,11,2,T2 ,,I mean thirty-five,47:15.0,47:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3295,11,2,T2 ,yeah thirty-five and then just over eight,,47:16.0,47:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3296,11,2,T2 ,,yup,47:22.0,47:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3297,11,2,T2 ,divided by eight what kind of equals that it's pen that's crazy,,47:23.0,47:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3298,11,2,T2 ,does it equal to yup does equal five yeah,,47:27.0,47:33.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3299,11,2,T2 ,,yeah no no no that would be great,47:33.0,47:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3300,11,2,T2 ,,that would be forty yeah thirty-five going to eight or eight going thirty-five,47:34.0,47:41.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3301,11,2,T2 ,so we just leave it as that,,47:41.0,47:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3302,11,2,T2 ,so x equals eight over thirty-five,,47:43.0,47:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3303,11,2,T2 ,,yup there you go,47:46.0,47:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3304,11,2,T2 ,,you got it,47:47.0,47:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3305,11,2,T2 ,,pause filler I left my free mystery just for last,47:51.0,47:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3306,11,2,T2 ,to look back pause filler well let's subtract this on this side so over there,,47:55.0,48:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3307,11,2,T2 ,so we just get one over x equals,,48:01.0,48:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3308,11,2,T2 ,and unfortunately this is going to be negative,,48:05.0,48:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3309,11,2,T2 ,so it's going to be,,48:08.0,48:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3310,11,2,T2 ,,pause filler negative one o three again negative one o three one common number,48:10.0,48:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3311,11,2,T2 ,negative one o three divided b one and then we get just x equals negative oh no just one,,48:14.0,48:29.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
3312,11,2,T2 ,,well you can say negative one over one o three,48:29.0,48:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3313,11,2,T2 ,yeah I think it just looks better,,48:30.0,48:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3314,11,2,T2 ,and that's our (inaudible) equal sign,,48:33.0,48:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3315,11,2,T2 ,,equals yeah,48:37.0,48:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3316,11,2,T2 ,last problem pause filler I'm assuming this isn't equal right here again,,48:39.0,48:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3317,11,2,T2 ,,remember that one is negative five,48:46.0,48:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3318,11,2,T2 ,,so you can add this one,48:47.0,48:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3319,11,2,T2 ,yeah it is negative,,48:49.0,48:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3320,11,2,T2 ,so just be eleven x over x,,48:50.0,48:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3321,11,2,T2 ,and then we can add,,48:53.0,48:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3322,11,2,T2 ,,yeah you can add the one o nine too so,48:56.0,48:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3323,11,2,T2 ,yeah well no no no we can't,,48:59.0,49:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3324,11,2,T2 ,because this is going on this side,,49:02.0,49:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3325,11,2,T2 ,so this has to be going on that side,,49:04.0,49:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3326,11,2,T2 ,,okay you're right,49:06.0,49:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3327,11,2,T2 ,,and then we'll subtract it,49:07.0,49:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3328,11,2,T2 ,so then subtract it so then pause filler,,49:09.0,49:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3329,11,2,T2 ,,negative three,49:11.0,49:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3330,11,2,T2 ,yeah three so it would be negative three hundred and forty,,49:13.0,49:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3331,11,2,T2 ,,yeah,49:18.0,49:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3332,11,2,T2 ,negative three hundred forty divided by eleven so x equals eleven over,,49:20.0,49:32.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
3333,11,2,T2 ,we could see negative to the matter three hundred and forty,,49:34.0,49:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3334,11,2,T2 ,,yup I think we got this and pause filler,49:39.0,49:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3335,11,2,T2 ,,,49:42.0,50:54.0,01:12.0,,,,,,
3336,11,2,T2 ,,stop look at this okay,49:43.0,49:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3337,11,2,T2 ,all right,,49:47.0,49:55.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3338,11,2,T2 ,,good,50:22.0,50:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3339,11,2,T2 ,all right I'm on it,,50:24.0,50:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3340,11,2,T2 ,,well he's already on that page,50:26.0,50:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3341,11,2,T2 ,,it's continuous for some reason,50:28.0,50:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3342,11,2,T2 ,,okay so we're on page thirteen right,50:30.0,50:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3343,11,2,T2 ,yeah,,50:34.0,50:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3344,11,2,T2 ,,because yeah it goes on to,50:37.0,50:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3345,11,2,T2 ,,so there's like a bonus round,50:40.0,50:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3346,11,2,T2 ,all right so you see,,50:43.0,50:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3347,11,2,T2 ,,yup tell me what you haven't seen before actually yeah kind of,50:46.0,50:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3348,11,2,T2 ,,because we have constants or we have coefficients,50:51.0,50:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3349,11,2,T2 ,so the first thing we should probably do is to get twenty onto the other side,,50:54.0,50:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3350,11,2,T2 ,so we get seven,,50:59.0,51:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3351,11,2,T2 ,,so we subtract twenty yeah seven,51:00.0,51:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3352,11,2,T2 ,,,51:01.0,51:48.0,00:47.0,,,,,,
3353,11,2,T2 ,and then we can just add this,,51:02.0,51:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3354,11,2,T2 ,,yeah so then it would be twelve over three x,51:03.0,51:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3355,11,2,T2 ,,that has to be reduced to four over x,51:07.0,51:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3356,11,2,T2 ,three x so over two yeah and let me just yeah reduce it by three so then four,,51:10.0,51:17.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3357,11,2,T2 ,,yeah,51:17.0,51:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3358,11,2,T2 ,so four,,51:18.0,51:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3359,11,2,T2 ,,so four over x,51:19.0,51:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3360,11,2,T2 ,and then we multiply that again,,51:20.0,51:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3361,11,2,T2 ,I'll just do this,,51:23.0,51:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3362,11,2,T2 ,just like explain it four x,,51:24.0,51:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3363,11,2,T2 ,and then multiply that by seven right no no,,51:28.0,51:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3364,11,2,T2 ,,so we'll divide yeah,51:31.0,51:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3365,11,2,T2 ,divide,,51:33.0,51:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3366,11,2,T2 ,,seven over four,51:33.0,51:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3367,11,2,T2 ,so seven over x equals seven over four,,51:35.0,51:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3368,11,2,T2 ,,x equals four over seven,51:37.0,51:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3369,11,2,T2 ,four yeah yeah yeah yeah,,51:38.0,51:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3370,11,2,T2 ,,yeah well that's good,51:42.0,51:47.0,00:05.0,,,UL,,,
3371,11,2,T2 ,oh boy,,51:47.0,51:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3372,11,2,T2 ,,,51:48.0,52:54.0,01:06.0,,,,,,
3373,11,2,T2 ,,pause filler what's that okay okay pause filler,51:49.0,51:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3374,11,2,T2 ,I'm freaking out,,51:51.0,51:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3375,11,2,T2 ,,we can pause filler,51:51.0,51:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3376,11,2,T2 ,just divide by,,51:54.0,51:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3377,11,2,T2 ,,yeah I mean pause filler,51:56.0,51:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3378,11,2,T2 ,don't you just divide it by two,,51:58.0,52:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3379,11,2,T2 ,,we used to (inaudible),52:01.0,52:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3380,11,2,T2 ,,now we'll make it easier,52:03.0,52:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3381,11,2,T2 ,your reciprocal so it would be like,,52:06.0,52:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3382,11,2,T2 ,,yeah yeah yeah yeah in fact I know how to get this,52:10.0,52:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,

3385,11,2,T2 ,don't use it as a cumulative property,,52:17.0,52:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3386,11,2,T2 ,,no no yeah well you can do that but pause filler (inaudible),52:23.0,52:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3387,11,2,T2 ,all right,,52:30.0,52:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

3517,12,1,S1 ,,yeah,06:12.0,06:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3518,12,1,S1 ,okay okay so x minus six equals thirteen,,07:26.0,07:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3519,12,1,T1 ,,,07:27.0,24:41.0,17:14.0,,,,,,
3520,12,1,T1 ,,,07:27.0,09:19.0,01:52.0,,,,,,
3521,12,1,T1 ,,okay so I know here that what you got to do is,07:31.0,07:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3522,12,1,T1 ,,you have x,07:34.0,07:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3523,12,1,T1 ,,okay that's cool,07:36.0,07:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3524,12,1,T1 ,,x minus six equals oh this is kind of hard actually,07:38.0,07:43.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3525,12,1,T1 ,yeah it is kind of confusing,,07:43.0,07:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3526,12,1,T1 ,,thirteen okay that's pause filler do as you do,07:45.0,07:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3527,12,1,T1 ,,x minus six plus six oh wow equals thirteen (laughter),07:49.0,07:56.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3528,12,1,T1 ,,and then so thirteen minus six,07:56.0,08:02.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3529,12,1,T1 ,well we have to add six right because,,08:02.0,08:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3530,12,1,T1 ,,yeah yeah add six,08:06.0,08:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3531,12,1,T1 ,we want to cancel them up,,08:07.0,08:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3532,12,1,T1 ,,I'm not sure we're going to write in pause filler,08:10.0,08:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3533,12,1,T1 ,okay so here we have x minus six equals thirteen,,08:12.0,08:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3534,12,1,T1 ,,so you have x minus six equals thirteen,08:17.0,08:24.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3535,12,1,T1 ,,and you pause filler add on both sides,08:24.0,08:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3536,12,1,T1 ,,and so you get,08:26.0,08:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3537,12,1,T1 ,add six yeah,,08:26.0,08:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3538,12,1,T1 ,,yeah so it's x minus six pause filler equals,08:27.0,08:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3539,12,1,T1 ,,oh x minus six equals thirteen plus six,08:33.0,08:43.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3540,12,1,T1 ,,and then just (inaudible) pause filler,08:43.0,08:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3541,12,1,T1 ,,and so then you get pause filler x equals that's,08:45.0,08:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3542,12,1,T1 ,,oh x equals pause filler,08:51.0,08:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3543,12,1,T1 ,nineteen,,08:53.0,08:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3544,12,1,T1 ,,nineteen yeah,08:54.0,08:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3545,12,1,T1 ,yeah good so but another way to so if we can put a add six on what I like doing is add six down here,,08:55.0,09:08.0,00:13.0,,,UL,,,
3546,12,1,T1 ,that way you can see that these cancel out,,09:08.0,09:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3547,12,1,T1 ,and then we're left with x equals nineteen just to organize your work a little bit more,,09:11.0,09:19.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3548,12,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm okay,09:19.0,09:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3549,12,1,T1 ,okay so next page,,09:19.0,09:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3550,12,1,T1 ,,,09:19.0,10:49.0,01:30.0,,,,,,
3551,12,1,T1 ,,yeah next page yeah cool cool,09:20.0,09:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3552,12,1,T1 ,okay fifteen equals negative eight plus p so,,09:22.0,09:28.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3553,12,1,T1 ,,okay so pause filler what I like to do is,09:29.0,09:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3554,12,1,T1 ,,I like to get pause filler I guess equal,09:31.0,09:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3555,12,1,T1 ,,I have to get on the variable on the left side,09:34.0,09:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3556,12,1,T1 ,,I assume that it's easier to me,09:37.0,09:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3557,12,1,T1 ,,I put them the variable on the left side,09:40.0,09:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3558,12,1,T1 ,,so yeah so it's pause filler,09:44.0,09:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3559,12,1,T1 ,so you're subtracting p first,,09:44.0,09:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3560,12,1,T1 ,,yeah well what I'm going to do I just like switch the problem around,09:46.0,09:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3561,12,1,T1 ,,it's what you do,09:50.0,09:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3562,12,1,T1 ,,you do p,09:51.0,09:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3563,12,1,T1 ,,I'll just do the normal way,09:53.0,09:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3564,12,1,T1 ,,fifteen equals negative eight plus p,09:56.0,10:02.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3565,12,1,T1 ,yeah now we'll yeah now we want to here,,10:03.0,10:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3566,12,1,T1 ,we want to add eight here right cancel out,,10:07.0,10:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3567,12,1,T1 ,,okay yes because adding negative eight is just like,10:10.0,10:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3568,12,1,T1 ,,then we add eight,10:14.0,10:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3569,12,1,T1 ,and then we have these that are crossed out,,10:15.0,10:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3570,12,1,T1 ,and then we have to do the same thing to both sides,,10:17.0,10:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3571,12,1,T1 ,and p equals and what's fifteen plus eight,,10:21.0,10:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3572,12,1,T1 ,,fifteen pardon me what's that,10:25.0,10:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3573,12,1,T1 ,fifteen plus eight,,10:28.0,10:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3574,12,1,T1 ,,oh it's twenty-three,10:29.0,10:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3575,12,1,T1 ,twenty-three yeah so this plus sign it would matter,,10:31.0,10:39.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3576,12,1,T1 ,it doesn't matter,,10:39.0,10:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3577,12,1,T1 ,because that's just basically saying that it's a positive p not a negative p,,10:40.0,10:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3578,12,1,T1 ,because if we want a negative p then it would just be negative for me,,10:44.0,10:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3579,12,1,T1 ,but it's not next page,,10:50.0,10:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3580,12,1,T1 ,,okay yeah mm-hmm okay,10:54.0,10:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3581,12,1,T1 ,,,10:57.0,11:34.0,00:37.0,,,,,,
3582,12,1,T1 ,that's seventeen equals k plus eleven,,10:57.0,11:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3583,12,1,T1 ,,okay so we have better okay,11:02.0,11:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3584,12,1,T1 ,,k plus eleven equals seventeen introduce you to,11:05.0,11:15.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3585,12,1,T1 ,,k plus eleven minus eleven equals seventeen minus eleven,11:15.0,11:23.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3586,12,1,T1 ,,and then seventeen minus eleven equals six,11:23.0,11:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3587,12,1,T1 ,,so you get k equals six,11:27.0,11:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3588,12,1,T1 ,,that equal sign is going to pop up,11:31.0,11:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3589,12,1,T1 ,,,11:35.0,14:38.0,03:03.0,,,,,,
3590,12,1,T1 ,yeah yup good job next page,,11:35.0,11:40.0,00:05.0,,,UL,,,
3591,12,1,T1 ,,yup forty-four yeah forty-four x equals two twenty,11:40.0,11:49.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3592,12,1,T1 ,,okay so you get forty wait,11:49.0,11:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3593,12,1,T1 ,,forty-four x equals two twenty,11:52.0,12:00.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3594,12,1,T1 ,,this is hard,12:00.0,12:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3595,12,1,T1 ,I know,,12:01.0,12:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3596,12,1,T1 ,,because pause filler so you get two twenty twenty divided by forty-four,12:02.0,12:13.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
3597,12,1,T1 ,yeah with x on the side,,12:14.0,12:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3598,12,1,T1 ,,yeah and we got forty-four x pause filler over forty-four,12:15.0,12:25.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3599,12,1,T1 ,,and we get pause filler,12:26.0,12:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3600,12,1,T1 ,,I'll do some scratch,12:28.0,12:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3601,12,1,T1 ,,it's just like pause filler two twenty,12:29.0,12:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3602,12,1,T1 ,,it's over here two twenty is that working,12:32.0,12:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3603,12,1,T1 ,well here is okay,,12:38.0,12:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3604,12,1,T1 ,so if we have forty and we have two hundred right,,12:40.0,12:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3605,12,1,T1 ,and we also have four and twenty,,12:44.0,12:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3606,12,1,T1 ,they're basically the same thing,,12:46.0,12:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3607,12,1,T1 ,we just add zero to both sides so and twenty and four,,12:47.0,12:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3608,12,1,T1 ,oh wow that's cool anyways pause filler,,12:55.0,12:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3609,12,1,T1 ,so twenty and four we do that,,12:57.0,13:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3610,12,1,T1 ,it's five right,,13:00.0,13:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

3615,12,1,T1 ,yes so here we have x equals what is actually,,13:12.0,13:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3616,12,1,T1 ,,because we got two twenty divided,13:17.0,13:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3617,12,1,T1 ,,here we go two twenty divided by forty-four,13:20.0,13:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3618,12,1,T1 ,,this is crazy,13:27.0,13:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

3627,12,1,T1 ,,okay here we go,14:26.0,14:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3628,12,1,T1 ,,so pause filler x equals,14:27.0,14:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3629,12,1,T1 ,,I don't know it's again,14:31.0,14:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,

3633,12,1,T1 ,,yup okay okay pause filler thirteen p oh my thirteen p plus negative nine,14:43.0,15:00.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
3634,12,1,T1 ,which is the same thing as negative nine right,,15:00.0,15:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3635,12,1,T1 ,,yeah plus minus is the same thing,15:03.0,15:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3636,12,1,T1 ,,it's just pause filler yeah,15:05.0,15:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3637,12,1,T1 ,minus,,15:05.0,15:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3638,12,1,T1 ,,yeah and so pause filler yeah thirteen p minus nine so you have thirteen p,15:07.0,15:15.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3639,12,1,T1 ,,pause filler I'm just going to do plus nine to the sides equals forty-one plus nine,15:16.0,15:24.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3640,12,1,T1 ,,then you got fifty you got thirteen p,15:24.0,15:31.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3641,12,1,T1 ,yeah so then so yeah divided by thirteen and then p equals what,,15:32.0,15:41.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3642,12,1,T1 ,,pause filler four it's four point something,15:41.0,15:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3643,12,1,T1 ,,pause filler I'm not sure,15:44.0,15:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3644,12,1,T1 ,yeah it's like four,,15:45.0,15:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3645,12,1,T1 ,no it's three point four,,15:47.0,15:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3646,12,1,T1 ,,it's forty-one now,16:05.0,16:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3647,12,1,T1 ,no it's three point something,,16:07.0,16:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3648,12,1,T1 ,,yeah it's right thirteen time nine,16:10.0,16:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3649,12,1,T1 ,,yeah it's like thirty-four here,16:13.0,16:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3650,12,1,T1 ,,and then like yeah it's pause filler,16:17.0,16:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3651,12,1,T1 ,three point pause filler it's eleven thirteen three and eleven thirteen so,,16:19.0,16:34.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
3652,12,1,T1 ,,yeah (inaudible) yeah,16:35.0,16:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3653,12,1,T1 ,so either of these can be an answer,,16:35.0,16:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3654,12,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm yeah you all select them,16:38.0,16:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3655,12,1,T1 ,,or you can do the improper fraction yeah (inaudible) mm-hmm great so next page,16:40.0,16:46.0,00:06.0,,,,UL,,
3656,12,1,T1 ,,,16:46.0,17:49.0,01:03.0,,,,,,
3657,12,1,T1 ,okay,,16:46.0,16:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3658,12,1,T1 ,,six x plus ten equals thirty-four,16:50.0,16:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3659,12,1,T1 ,,okay six pause filler six x plus ten equals thirty-four,16:52.0,17:02.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3660,12,1,T1 ,,okay so basically you have six x plus ten equals thirty-four,17:06.0,17:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3661,12,1,T1 ,,so you just pause filler subtract ten on both sides,17:09.0,17:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3662,12,1,T1 ,,six x minus ten pause filler equals thirty-four minus ten which is thirty-four which is six x equals twenty-four,17:12.0,17:23.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
3663,12,1,T1 ,,then what I want you to do is you divide,17:23.0,17:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3664,12,1,T1 ,six,,17:27.0,17:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3665,12,1,T1 ,,five plus sign pause filler so and x equals four,17:27.0,17:33.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3666,12,1,T1 ,yeah I don't know,,17:33.0,17:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3667,12,1,T1 ,,yeah I'm having a little trouble,17:37.0,17:42.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3668,12,1,T1 ,,you want to try,17:42.0,17:49.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3669,12,1,T1 ,yeah me too next page,,17:49.0,17:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3670,12,1,T1 ,,,17:49.0,19:24.0,01:35.0,,,,,,
3671,12,1,T1 ,,yup,17:53.0,17:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3672,12,1,T1 ,okay,,17:53.0,17:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3673,12,1,T1 ,,okay okay fifteen okay plus twenty-two it is plus and minus which is the same thing as minus equals forty pause filler which we got fourteen times five,17:53.0,18:07.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
3674,12,1,T1 ,,so we got fifteen k plus twenty-two equals forty plus twenty-two,18:07.0,18:15.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3675,12,1,T1 ,,and forty plus twenty-two is sixty-two sixty-two,18:15.0,18:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3676,12,1,T1 ,,and you have fifteen pause filler,18:20.0,18:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3677,12,1,T1 ,,and you get like four okay,18:23.0,18:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3678,12,1,T1 ,,and you basically pause filler fifteen k over forty,18:25.0,18:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3679,12,1,T1 ,and we divide it by fifty,,18:29.0,18:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3680,12,1,T1 ,,yeah it's just like pause filler forty and fifty,18:31.0,18:38.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3681,12,1,T1 ,,and x equals fifteen yeah,18:38.0,18:43.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3682,12,1,T1 ,yeah so (inaudible),,18:45.0,18:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3683,12,1,T1 ,,we like to go fourteen over fifteen yeah,18:46.0,18:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3684,12,1,T1 ,forty over fifteen,,18:48.0,18:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3685,12,1,T1 ,,k k equals fourteen over fifteen,18:49.0,18:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3686,12,1,T1 ,,yeah variable equals forty,18:51.0,18:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3687,12,1,T1 ,where did you get the forty,,18:53.0,18:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3688,12,1,T1 ,because didn't we have sixty-two to the forty,,18:56.0,18:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3689,12,1,T1 ,,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's why I wrote there two hundred just didn't really put where sixty-two over fifteen yeah,18:58.0,19:06.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3690,12,1,T1 ,and that's also equivalent to four and two fifteens yeah,,19:06.0,19:13.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3691,12,1,T1 ,,yeah just not yeah how about improper fraction times to the next number,19:14.0,19:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3692,12,1,T1 ,,I've seen this,19:20.0,19:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3693,12,1,T1 ,,like it's really easier okay (inaudible) yeah all righty,19:20.0,19:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3694,12,1,T1 ,okay,,19:23.0,19:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3695,12,1,T1 ,,,19:24.0,20:20.0,00:56.0,,,,,,
3696,12,1,T1 ,,seven is that an x,19:24.0,19:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3697,12,1,T1 ,,it's an x yeah yeah,19:27.0,19:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3698,12,1,T1 ,,seven x plus wow plus wow plus twelve twelve equals thirty-three,19:31.0,19:45.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
3699,12,1,T1 ,,okay that's seven x minus twelve equals thirty-three minus twelve pause filler,19:45.0,19:53.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3700,12,1,T1 ,,so x minus twelve and so you got pause filler seven x equals twenty on pause filler,19:53.0,20:04.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
3701,12,1,T1 ,,and then x equals three,20:05.0,20:11.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3702,12,1,T1 ,yeah,,20:11.0,20:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3703,12,1,T1 ,,(inaudible) yeah,20:13.0,20:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3704,12,1,T1 ,so divide it by seven,,20:14.0,20:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3705,12,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm,20:16.0,20:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3706,12,1,T1 ,and when you get into bigger things,,20:17.0,20:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3707,12,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm yeah,20:19.0,20:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3708,12,1,T1 ,,,20:20.0,22:00.0,01:40.0,,,,,,
3709,12,1,T1 ,okay next page,,20:20.0,20:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3710,12,1,T1 ,,yup ready,20:25.0,20:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3711,12,1,T1 ,okay something on both sides,,20:30.0,20:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3712,12,1,T1 ,,three plus fifty equals three ps right plus twelve,20:34.0,20:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3713,12,1,T1 ,,okay this is too complicated,20:38.0,20:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3714,12,1,T1 ,,okay I'm going to go three p plus twelve equals p plus fifteen,20:40.0,20:49.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3715,12,1,T1 ,,okay so what I want you do to is you have to subtract p on both sides on one side yeah both sides yeah pause filler,20:49.0,20:58.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3716,12,1,T1 ,yeah both sides you do the same thing to both sides,,20:58.0,21:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3717,12,1,T1 ,,so you get pause filler,21:01.0,21:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3718,12,1,T1 ,,so you have two p plus fifteen equals,21:01.0,21:07.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3719,12,1,T1 ,,it goes twelve here plus fifteen (inaudible),21:08.0,21:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3720,12,1,T1 ,,for them I switch everything or so the (inaudible) would be on the left,21:11.0,21:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3721,12,1,T1 ,,so it's just easier,21:14.0,21:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3722,12,1,T1 ,,so I have two p plus twelve equals fifteen,21:16.0,21:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3723,12,1,T1 ,,what you do is you do two p,21:21.0,21:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3724,12,1,T1 ,,pause filler two p pause filler plus twelve minus twelve equals fifteen minus twelve,21:24.0,21:34.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3725,12,1,T1 ,,and that's twelve (laughter),21:34.0,21:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3726,12,1,T1 ,,pause filler yeah so we're going to have two p divided by two equals p,21:36.0,21:44.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3727,12,1,T1 ,,and you have pause filler three over two p equals three over two yeah,21:44.0,21:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3728,12,1,T1 ,yeah or it can be one point five,,21:50.0,21:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3729,12,1,T1 ,this is one point five,,21:54.0,21:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3730,12,1,T1 ,I don't know down here,,21:56.0,21:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3731,12,1,T1 ,,yeah yeah I see it,21:57.0,21:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3732,12,1,T1 ,,,22:00.0,24:09.0,02:09.0,,,,,,
3733,12,1,T1 ,okay next page,,22:00.0,22:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3734,12,1,T1 ,,yeah ready,22:03.0,22:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3735,12,1,T1 ,it's the last one,,22:04.0,22:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3736,12,1,T1 ,,so we got k minus ten equals eight k minus sixty-eight okay,22:06.0,22:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3737,12,1,T1 ,,so we got eight k minus sixty-eight equals k excuse me or ten,22:12.0,22:23.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
3738,12,1,T1 ,,so you get pause filler eight k pause filler,22:24.0,22:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3739,12,1,T1 ,,and you get eight k minus k pause filler minus sixty-eight equals k minus k ten,22:30.0,22:44.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
3740,12,1,T1 ,,so you get negative ten equals eight k minus sixty-eight,22:44.0,22:55.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
3741,12,1,T1 ,wait eight k or seven k,,22:55.0,22:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3742,12,1,T1 ,,seven k,22:57.0,22:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3743,12,1,T1 ,yeah,,22:58.0,22:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3744,12,1,T1 ,,seven k then you get seven k pause filler minus sixty-eight plus sixty-eight equals ten plus sixty-eight equals seventy-eight seven,22:59.0,23:25.0,00:26.0,,,,,,
3745,12,1,T1 ,,and that's pause filler eleven,23:25.0,23:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3746,12,1,T1 ,,and then get pause filler k,23:26.0,23:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3747,12,1,T1 ,wait this is a negative k,,23:28.0,23:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3748,12,1,T1 ,so this is fifteen,,23:31.0,23:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3749,12,1,T1 ,,negative okay yeah,23:32.0,23:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3750,12,1,T1 ,yeah so you want to keep track your negative,,23:33.0,23:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3751,12,1,T1 ,,oh yeah oh yeah oh that's negative,23:35.0,23:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3752,12,1,T1 ,,oh I didn't see that out there,23:38.0,23:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3753,12,1,T1 ,,yeah so what you do is you get negative ten plus sixty-eight which equal,23:40.0,23:45.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3754,12,1,T1 ,,it does not equal seventy-eight equals pause filler fifty-eight okay which makes sense,23:45.0,23:51.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3755,12,1,T1 ,,but k equals fifty pause filler,23:51.0,23:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3756,12,1,T1 ,,oops k equals fifty-eight over seven yeah,23:54.0,24:03.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3757,12,1,T1 ,and k equals what,,24:05.0,24:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3758,12,1,T1 ,,k equals fifty-eight over seven,24:07.0,24:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3759,12,1,T1 ,yup,,24:08.0,24:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3760,12,1,T1 ,,yeah,24:09.0,24:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3761,12,1,T1 ,okay so I don't know what's happening now,,24:12.0,24:18.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3762,12,1,T1 ,,pause filler I have no idea pause filler,24:18.0,24:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3763,12,1,T1 ,,yeah (laughter) let's stop,24:21.0,24:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3764,12,1,T1 ,,I'm going to get this guy,24:24.0,24:33.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3765,12,1,T1 ,,so I'm going to get on to see where she is,24:33.0,24:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3766,12,1,T1 ,okay I will too,,24:39.0,24:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3767,12,1,T1 ,,great,25:29.0,25:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3768,12,1,T1 ,to start,,25:35.0,25:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3769,12,1,T1 ,hi,,25:45.0,25:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3770,12,1,T1 ,,,25:46.0,27:50.0,02:04.0,,,,,,
3771,12,1,T1 ,,hey what's up we got the bonus round (laughter),25:46.0,25:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3772,12,1,T1 ,,okay pause filler so I'm ready,25:50.0,25:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3773,12,1,T1 ,,,25:51.0,27:38.0,01:47.0,,,,,,
3774,12,1,T1 ,,okay let's go,25:51.0,25:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3775,12,1,T1 ,so are you tutoring this one,,25:52.0,25:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3776,12,1,T1 ,,pause filler no the rules are still the same,25:55.0,25:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3777,12,1,T1 ,,they're just going to like do something,25:56.0,25:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3778,12,1,T1 ,,but rules are still the same,25:58.0,26:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3779,12,1,T1 ,,so pause filler you're still the tutor,26:00.0,26:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3780,12,1,T1 ,,and so do you still have your study guide with you,26:02.0,26:08.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3781,12,1,T1 ,no,,26:08.0,26:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3782,12,1,T1 ,,yeah so you don't have any study guide this time and pause filler yeah yeah great pause filler okay,26:08.0,26:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3783,12,1,T1 ,,so pause filler two r minus fifteen equals r minus thirty-three,26:17.0,26:27.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3784,12,1,T1 ,,okay what you got to do over here two r plus fifteen equals r,26:28.0,26:36.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3785,12,1,T1 ,,wait I messed it up pause filler probably,26:36.0,26:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3786,12,1,T1 ,,there's two variables there because pause filler two,26:41.0,26:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3787,12,1,T1 ,,I got two r minus fifteen equals pause filler,26:47.0,26:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3788,12,1,T1 ,,that's minus fifteen minus r minus r equals r,26:52.0,27:01.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3789,12,1,T1 ,,minus r minus thirty-three and so you got pause filler thirty-three on this side and pause filler one,27:01.0,27:11.0,00:10.0,,,,,,

3856,12,1,T2 ,,,35:30.0,35:59.0,00:29.0,,,,,,
3857,12,1,T2 ,okay so here I have negative three plus x equals twenty-two,,35:31.0,35:41.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3858,12,1,T2 ,and I'm going to add to those sides,,35:41.0,35:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3859,12,1,T2 ,so that way we're left with x equals twenty-five what,,35:50.0,35:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3860,12,1,T2 ,,yup yeah that's great yeah,35:56.0,35:59.0,00:03.0,,,UL,,,
3861,12,1,T2 ,,let's go to the next page,36:00.0,36:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3862,12,1,T2 ,,,36:02.0,36:52.0,00:50.0,,,,,,
3863,12,1,T2 ,okay,,36:03.0,36:03.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3864,12,1,T2 ,,okay so negative y plus eighteen equals twenty-three,36:03.0,36:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3865,12,1,T2 ,so subtract eighteen plus five negative four equals twenty-five and the,,36:06.0,36:20.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
3866,12,1,T2 ,,I think it's twenty-three,36:20.0,36:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3867,12,1,T2 ,,wait it's twenty-three not twenty-five,36:22.0,36:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3868,12,1,T2 ,oh five for this,,36:27.0,36:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3869,12,1,T2 ,,yeah mm-hmm oh negative oh I'm sorry yeah five pause filler,36:29.0,36:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3870,12,1,T2 ,and then we got y equals negative five,,36:32.0,36:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3871,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm okay because you got negative y,36:37.0,36:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3872,12,1,T2 ,,and you can get rid of that y divided by negative one yeah pause filler great pause filler,36:41.0,36:47.0,00:06.0,,,UL,,,
3873,12,1,T2 ,that's it,,36:48.0,36:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3874,12,1,T2 ,,yeah I got it,36:49.0,36:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3875,12,1,T2 ,so go to (inaudible) to both sides,,36:52.0,36:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3876,12,1,T2 ,,,36:52.0,37:55.0,01:03.0,,,,,,
3877,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm yeah or we could subtract k but pause filler yeah,36:57.0,37:01.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3878,12,1,T2 ,yeah you could do either negative,,37:01.0,37:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3879,12,1,T2 ,,yeah by subtracting here,37:03.0,37:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3880,12,1,T2 ,thirty-six and then plus two k right,,37:06.0,37:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3881,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler no I think it was thirty-six plus,37:10.0,37:17.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3882,12,1,T2 ,,yeah mm-hmm because you add right,37:17.0,37:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3883,12,1,T2 ,mm-hmm,,37:19.0,37:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3884,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm okay that's where it's two k yeah,37:20.0,37:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3885,12,1,T2 ,subtract thirty-six to both sides,,37:22.0,37:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3886,12,1,T2 ,and that's negative fifty equals two k,,37:27.0,37:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3887,12,1,T2 ,and then divide by two with negative twenty-five equals k,,37:32.0,37:43.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
3888,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm pause filler yeah that's right,37:44.0,37:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3889,12,1,T2 ,,I think that's correct pause filler okay,37:48.0,37:55.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3890,12,1,T2 ,okay,,37:55.0,37:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3891,12,1,T2 ,,okay wait I think wait,37:55.0,37:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3892,12,1,T2 ,,you passed it no,37:57.0,37:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3893,12,1,T2 ,,okay hold on okay okay,37:58.0,37:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3894,12,1,T2 ,,,37:59.0,39:17.0,01:18.0,,,,,,
3895,12,1,T2 ,,so seventeen minus b equals thirteen plus b,37:59.0,38:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3896,12,1,T2 ,I'm going to add b,,38:03.0,38:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3897,12,1,T2 ,,you add b okay,38:06.0,38:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3898,12,1,T2 ,okay seventeen equals thirteen two b,,38:08.0,38:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3899,12,1,T2 ,subtract thirteen from both sides right,,38:17.0,38:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3900,12,1,T2 ,and then four equals two b,,38:22.0,38:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3901,12,1,T2 ,you can divide by,,38:27.0,38:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3902,12,1,T2 ,,yeah we subtract them thirteen but yeah yeah yeah,38:29.0,38:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3903,12,1,T2 ,okay so then two equals b,,38:34.0,38:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3904,12,1,T2 ,let me just check that two fifth equals yeah well,,38:36.0,38:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3905,12,1,T2 ,and you know that they have to be,,38:42.0,38:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3906,12,1,T2 ,,yeah yeah yeah,38:48.0,38:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3907,12,1,T2 ,here you just subtract one here yeah,,38:49.0,38:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3908,12,1,T2 ,so you notice between thirteen fifteen,,38:52.0,38:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3909,12,1,T2 ,that's seventeen and fifteen,,38:56.0,38:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3910,12,1,T2 ,that's pause filler fifteen,,38:58.0,39:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3911,12,1,T2 ,so you know seventeen minus,,39:00.0,39:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3912,12,1,T2 ,but you have to do fifteen well,,39:01.0,39:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3913,12,1,T2 ,,okay oops I just opened the window oh,39:05.0,39:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3914,12,1,T2 ,,okay I don't know how to fix that,39:11.0,39:16.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3915,12,1,T2 ,okay,,39:16.0,39:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3916,12,1,T2 ,,okay I got,39:16.0,39:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3917,12,1,T2 ,,,39:17.0,39:38.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
3918,12,1,T2 ,okay so here we divide it by negative nine right,,39:17.0,39:24.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3919,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm,39:23.0,39:30.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3920,12,1,T2 ,we got g equals negative nine right,,39:25.0,39:36.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
3921,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm that's right,39:36.0,39:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3922,12,1,T2 ,,,39:38.0,40:23.0,00:45.0,,,,,,
3923,12,1,T2 ,,let's go to the next page,39:39.0,39:49.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3924,12,1,T2 ,okay so we'll subtract ten,,39:49.0,39:57.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3925,12,1,T2 ,and I divide it by negative eight right,,39:58.0,40:08.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3926,12,1,T2 ,okay one equals pause filler nine so negative nine,,40:08.0,40:18.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3927,12,1,T2 ,,yup yup yeah yeah that's great,40:19.0,40:23.0,00:04.0,,,UL,,,
3928,12,1,T2 ,,,40:27.0,42:57.0,02:30.0,,,,,,
3929,12,1,T2 ,,that's cool okay next page okay,40:27.0,40:37.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
3930,12,1,T2 ,subtract sixty-five right,,40:37.0,40:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3931,12,1,T2 ,,yup yeah,40:41.0,40:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3932,12,1,T2 ,and then seventy okay thirty is that thirty-two no forty-two,,40:42.0,40:51.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3933,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler what I would try to do is,40:51.0,40:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3934,12,1,T2 ,,I try to like solve everything out,40:53.0,40:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3935,12,1,T2 ,,so I round up the whole entire problem so not like pause filler like that you are actually trying to do pause filler just like trying to like finish it mentally in your head so,40:55.0,41:06.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
3936,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler and what I would do here was I do like,41:06.0,41:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3937,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler because you subtract sixty-five both sides,41:09.0,41:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3938,12,1,T2 ,,and you divide those sides by negative fourteen,41:13.0,41:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3939,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler and what answers did you do again,41:17.0,41:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3940,12,1,T2 ,pause filler let's see a hundred seven minus sixty-five fifty-two,,41:20.0,41:29.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3941,12,1,T2 ,I believe no pause filler forty-two,,41:29.0,41:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3942,12,1,T2 ,,write down your answers,41:33.0,41:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3943,12,1,T2 ,,just go confirm you're correct yeah,41:34.0,41:40.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3944,12,1,T2 ,,write your pause filler how you got it,41:40.0,41:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3945,12,1,T2 ,oh pause filler well I just took sixty-five,,41:43.0,41:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3946,12,1,T2 ,and I tried to work my way up to a hundred seven,,41:48.0,41:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3947,12,1,T2 ,so I just went to seventy,,41:53.0,41:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3948,12,1,T2 ,and I knew that was plus five,,41:55.0,41:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3949,12,1,T2 ,and I went to a hundred,,41:56.0,41:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3950,12,1,T2 ,and now it's plus thirty,,41:58.0,42:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3951,12,1,T2 ,and then I plus seven,,42:01.0,42:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3952,12,1,T2 ,and then if I add up oh gee seven,,42:03.0,42:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

3971,12,1,T2 ,okay so add forty-one,,43:13.0,43:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3972,12,1,T2 ,seventy-five equals negative nine k,,43:21.0,43:28.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
3973,12,1,T2 ,then divide it by nine right,,43:29.0,43:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3974,12,1,T2 ,,yeah you added forty-one right to thirty-four,43:32.0,43:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3975,12,1,T2 ,,and then you pause filler did pause filler nine did okay pause filler,43:35.0,43:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3976,12,1,T2 ,divide it by nine right,,43:37.0,43:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3977,12,1,T2 ,,yeah,43:39.0,43:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

3980,12,1,T2 ,my answer is seventy-five divided by nine negative seventy-five divided by nine,,43:44.0,43:52.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3981,12,1,T2 ,,yeah (inaudible) yeah,43:52.0,43:52.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
3982,12,1,T2 ,okay,,43:52.0,43:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3983,12,1,T2 ,,good yeah pause filler whoop,43:54.0,43:56.0,00:02.0,,,UL,,,

3986,12,1,T2 ,,,44:02.0,45:41.0,01:39.0,,,,,,
3987,12,1,T2 ,okay I'm going to add p to both sides negative fifty-two minus sixteen,,44:02.0,44:18.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
3988,12,1,T2 ,I'm going to add sixteen,,44:18.0,44:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
3989,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm,44:18.0,44:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3990,12,1,T2 ,so that tensions these out,,44:22.0,44:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
3991,12,1,T2 ,and we get this two fifty-two,,44:26.0,44:31.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
3992,12,1,T2 ,,that is negative,44:31.0,44:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3993,12,1,T2 ,,let's add well,44:35.0,44:44.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
3994,12,1,T2 ,,how would you do this,44:44.0,44:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
3995,12,1,T2 ,,okay so pause filler so okay you get fifty-two equals nine p,44:45.0,44:53.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
3996,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler excuse me okay so you get fifty-two equals nine p plus sixteen okay plus,44:54.0,45:06.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
3997,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler you get rid of pause filler the,45:06.0,45:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
3998,12,1,T2 ,,it's going to be like plus sixteen minus sixteen plus sixteen,45:08.0,45:14.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
3999,12,1,T2 ,,you add sixteen plus negative fifty-two yeah yeah,45:15.0,45:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4000,12,1,T2 ,,and you get pause filler,45:18.0,45:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4001,12,1,T2 ,,the answer is negative okay,45:19.0,45:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4002,12,1,T2 ,,yeah let's just give it out yeah,45:22.0,45:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4003,12,1,T2 ,so here we have p equals,,45:26.0,45:33.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4004,12,1,T2 ,and that's negative four right,,45:34.0,45:41.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4005,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler yeah,45:41.0,45:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4006,12,1,T2 ,here we go next page,,45:42.0,45:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4007,12,1,T2 ,,,45:44.0,46:56.0,01:12.0,,,,,,
4008,12,1,T2 ,,yup I got this,45:44.0,45:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4009,12,1,T2 ,okay so I'm going to add forty w to both sides first equals nineteen plus,,45:48.0,46:09.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
4010,12,1,T2 ,is that forty w,,46:10.0,46:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4011,12,1,T2 ,is that correct,,46:13.0,46:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4012,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler yeah I think so oh,46:14.0,46:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4013,12,1,T2 ,,that's what I think it is yeah,46:18.0,46:22.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4014,12,1,T2 ,okay so then subtract nineteen yeah,,46:22.0,46:29.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4015,12,1,T2 ,can I get a sixteen equals forty w divided by forty,,46:29.0,46:41.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4016,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm,46:40.0,46:47.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4017,12,1,T2 ,negative forty plus w,,46:43.0,46:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4018,12,1,T2 ,,yeah I think so yeah that's right,46:47.0,46:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4019,12,1,T2 ,is that it,,46:51.0,46:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4020,12,1,T2 ,oopsies,,46:51.0,46:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4021,12,1,T2 ,,yeah okay,46:53.0,46:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4022,12,1,T2 ,,okay I will get them,46:53.0,47:02.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4023,12,1,T2 ,,great thank you,47:32.0,47:38.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4024,12,1,T2 ,,,47:35.0,55:54.0,08:19.0,,,,,,
4025,12,1,T2 ,,,47:40.0,49:00.0,01:20.0,,,,,,
4026,12,1,T2 ,so am I supposed to do this,,47:40.0,47:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4027,12,1,T2 ,,yeah so negative y minus sixty-three equals forty-three plus y,47:42.0,47:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4028,12,1,T2 ,okay so add y to both sides,,47:47.0,47:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4029,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm,47:53.0,47:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4030,12,1,T2 ,negative sixty-three plus forty-three plus two y and then subtract forty-three to both sides,,47:56.0,48:11.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
4031,12,1,T2 ,then get negative hundred six equals two y,,48:13.0,48:20.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4032,12,1,T2 ,and divide it by two okay,,48:21.0,48:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4033,12,1,T2 ,pause filler fifty-three equals y,,48:29.0,48:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4034,12,1,T2 ,is that,,48:32.0,48:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4035,12,1,T2 ,have you done anything differently or is that,,48:34.0,48:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4036,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler no I would just pause filler subtract y but pause filler since you add y,48:39.0,48:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4037,12,1,T2 ,oh that's good I think that's good,,48:43.0,48:50.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4038,12,1,T2 ,,yeah uh-huh,48:51.0,48:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4039,12,1,T2 ,so what (inaudible) now,,48:54.0,48:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4040,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler just keep doing the problems until they come and get us,48:56.0,49:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4041,12,1,T2 ,,,49:00.0,49:56.0,00:56.0,,,,,,
4042,12,1,T2 ,oh okay pause filler so good pause filler,,49:00.0,49:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4043,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler yeah yeah,49:04.0,49:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4044,12,1,T2 ,I'm just going to check that,,49:08.0,49:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4045,12,1,T2 ,it's kind of so (inaudible),,49:15.0,49:46.0,00:31.0,,,,,,
4046,12,1,T2 ,yeah I think that's good,,49:48.0,49:55.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4047,12,1,T2 ,,,49:56.0,51:09.0,01:13.0,,,,,,
4048,12,1,T2 ,okay I'm going to do it by subtract pause filler fifty-three to both sides this time,,49:56.0,50:19.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
4049,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm,50:09.0,50:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4050,12,1,T2 ,,okay we can try that yeah,50:20.0,50:27.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4051,12,1,T2 ,,we can get it,50:28.0,50:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4052,12,1,T2 ,,it's supposed to yeah mm-hmm,50:30.0,50:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4053,12,1,T2 ,seventy-six so then should I add g to both sides,,50:35.0,50:48.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
4054,12,1,T2 ,this is seventy-six,,50:48.0,50:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4055,12,1,T2 ,,yeah pause filler it's two seventy-six equals two g yeah,50:51.0,50:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4056,12,1,T2 ,,and then pause filler you got to divide both sides by two yeah,50:55.0,50:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4057,12,1,T2 ,yeah and okay g equals thirty-eight right,,50:57.0,51:09.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4058,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler yeah yeah yeah yeah we go to the next page,51:10.0,51:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4059,12,1,T2 ,,we show both,51:15.0,51:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4060,12,1,T2 ,well wait which page are you on so sixteen,,51:17.0,51:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4061,12,1,T2 ,,,51:22.0,52:43.0,01:21.0,,,,,,
4062,12,1,T2 ,,yeah okay so negative m plus seventy-one equals forty-three plus f,51:23.0,52:02.0,00:39.0,,,,,,
4063,12,1,T2 ,yeah you think this is okay,,52:02.0,52:20.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
4064,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler yeah yeah pause filler yeah divided by two,52:20.0,52:30.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4065,12,1,T2 ,cool,,52:32.0,52:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4066,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler yeah yeah you're right,52:36.0,52:43.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4067,12,1,T2 ,,,52:43.0,53:15.0,00:32.0,,,,,,
4068,12,1,T2 ,okay pause filler eight sixty-five by negative eighteen right,,52:44.0,53:05.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
4069,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm x equals yeah mm-hmm great,53:07.0,53:13.0,00:06.0,,,UL,,,
4070,12,1,T2 ,okay,,53:14.0,53:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4071,12,1,T2 ,,,53:17.0,54:50.0,01:33.0,,,,,,
4072,12,1,T2 ,,negative sixty-seven minus fifty-six x equals one hundred and thirty-three plus forty-four x,53:17.0,53:25.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4073,12,1,T2 ,okay so add sixty-seven to both sides of course,,53:26.0,53:35.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4074,12,1,T2 ,and that cancels these out,,53:35.0,53:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4075,12,1,T2 ,negative fifty-six x equals one seventy right because,,53:40.0,53:50.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4076,12,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm because yeah that's add them both,53:51.0,53:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4077,12,1,T2 ,and then you add forty-four x oh,,53:55.0,54:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4078,12,1,T2 ,and then subtract forty-four x,,54:00.0,54:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4079,12,1,T2 ,,you get negative six x and one seventy all alone yup yup yup yup,54:04.0,54:13.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4080,12,1,T2 ,and a hundred so negative and a hundred x equals one seventy divided by a negative hundred divided by negative hundred,,54:14.0,54:29.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
4081,12,1,T2 ,you get x equals negative seventy over hundred,,54:29.0,54:39.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4082,12,1,T2 ,is that good,,54:40.0,54:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4083,12,1,T2 ,,wait what is your x again,54:41.0,54:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4084,12,1,T2 ,,I can't see what's on there,54:44.0,54:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4085,12,1,T2 ,pause filler it's pause filler negative one hundred seventy over a hundred,,54:46.0,54:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4086,12,1,T2 ,,yeah yeah next page,54:51.0,54:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4087,12,1,T2 ,,,54:57.0,55:54.0,00:57.0,,,,,,
4088,12,1,T2 ,okay pause filler so let's subtract forty-nine,,54:57.0,55:08.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
4089,12,1,T2 ,okay there we go,,55:08.0,55:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4090,12,1,T2 ,forty-nine negative forty-two y equals nineteen y,,55:11.0,55:21.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4091,12,1,T2 ,and then negative twelve and subtract nineteen y and forty-one,,55:23.0,55:46.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
4092,12,1,T2 ,I believe is that negative forty-one y,,55:46.0,55:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4093,12,1,T2 ,,pause filler yeah that's right,55:49.0,55:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4094,12,1,T2 ,,I think it's pause filler yeah yeah yeah,55:49.0,55:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,

4139,12,2,S1 ,,half of the kids go to CAPA,03:32.0,03:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4140,12,2,S1 ,,and so yeah you get to know a lot of people,03:35.0,03:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4141,12,2,S1 ,,CAPA is a good school though,03:40.0,03:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4142,12,2,S1 ,,it's like my cousins went there and through high school,03:42.0,03:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4143,12,2,S1 ,,and they really loved it,03:47.0,03:58.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
4144,12,2,S1 ,so I'm tutoring you (inaudible),,04:03.0,04:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,

4146,12,2,S1 ,,I think they said,04:09.0,04:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4147,12,2,S1 ,,but I'm not even sure really,04:10.0,04:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,SD
4148,12,2,S1 ,you just (inaudible) a lot harder,,04:13.0,04:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4149,12,2,S1 ,,yeah I did like instead of like,04:15.0,04:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4150,12,2,S1 ,,I am subtracting sum and division multiplication yeah,04:18.0,04:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4151,12,2,S1 ,,where are you in your math right now,04:24.0,04:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,QE
4152,12,2,S1 ,,are you in like pre-algebra or like algebra one or,04:26.0,04:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,QE
4153,12,2,S1 ,I'm in algebra one (inaudible),,04:30.0,04:38.0,00:08.0,,,,,SD,
4154,12,2,S1 ,so I still have a lot of problems like that,,04:39.0,04:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4155,12,2,S1 ,but (inaudible) figure out a lot of them,,04:45.0,04:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4156,12,2,S1 ,,yeah I'm an algebra one too,04:47.0,04:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,SD
4157,12,2,S1 ,,and I've been there with those problems like a couple of times,04:49.0,04:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,SD
4158,12,2,S1 ,,like I haven't really liked know ever,04:52.0,04:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,SD

4160,12,2,S1 ,,but there really hasn��_t been a day like problems to me and so now exciting,04:59.0,05:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4161,12,2,S1 ,,you really never use that much,05:04.0,05:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4162,12,2,S1 ,,like you just use like addition subtraction like yeah the basic stuff,05:07.0,05:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4163,12,2,S1 ,,(inaudible),05:12.0,05:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4164,12,2,S1 ,,mm-hmm yeah test,05:15.0,05:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4165,12,2,S1 ,we just had a test on (inaudible) multiply that,,05:18.0,05:29.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
4166,12,2,S1 ,,oh so you guys are doing like simple one like compound interest,05:29.0,05:37.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4167,12,2,S1 ,yeah what and (inaudible),,05:37.0,05:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4168,12,2,S1 ,,oh yeah yeah yeah functions and we had like,05:41.0,05:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4169,12,2,S1 ,,pause filler but like one of our chapters it was like the worst,05:46.0,05:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4170,12,2,S1 ,,we had to learn them twenty-four different formulas,05:49.0,05:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4171,12,2,S1 ,,and that��_s all we have four,05:52.0,05:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4172,12,2,S1 ,,because like it was just so horrible,05:54.0,05:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4173,12,2,S1 ,,and he didn't tell us that we're going to have to memorize it,05:56.0,06:01.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4174,12,2,S1 ,,but then I ended up memorizing it anyways just to be safe,06:01.0,06:07.0,00:06.0,,,,,,SD
4175,12,2,S1 ,,because they tell you there was like a sheet,06:07.0,06:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4176,12,2,S1 ,,but you want to make sure that you knew well enough so that pause filler so that we didn't have to look back later in life so we just,06:09.0,06:16.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4177,12,2,S1 ,,pause filler he didn't let us use that,06:16.0,06:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4178,12,2,S1 ,yeah,,06:19.0,06:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4179,12,2,S1 ,,in eighth grade pause filler I do like geometry,06:21.0,06:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,SD
4180,12,2,S1 ,,do you guys do geometry in eighth grade or seventh grade,06:26.0,06:33.0,00:07.0,,,,,,QE
4181,12,2,S1 ,,or did you guys do geometry at all,06:33.0,06:42.0,00:09.0,,,,,,QE
4182,12,2,S1 ,(inaudible) they're actually going to start (inaudible),,06:43.0,06:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4183,12,2,S1 ,,yeah I'm in algebra one so yeah,06:47.0,06:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4184,12,2,S1 ,yeah so (inaudible) geometry in eighth grade (inaudible),,06:50.0,06:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4185,12,2,S1 ,,it's like pause filler I was supposed to be advanced with my math,07:21.0,07:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,SD
4186,12,2,S1 ,,but pause filler I was like my brother didn't want me going up to his grade I remember that,07:26.0,07:37.0,00:11.0,,,,,,SD
4187,12,2,S1 ,okay so we have three sevenths,,08:10.0,08:19.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4188,12,2,S1 ,,oh three sevenths x equals yeah,08:20.0,08:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4189,12,2,S1 ,okay so (inaudible) we just want them,,08:23.0,08:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4190,12,2,S1 ,,okay what you have to do is pause filler,08:27.0,08:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4191,12,2,S1 ,,since you try and get the x alone pause filler okay,08:29.0,08:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4192,12,2,S1 ,,maybe that��_s good okay thank you yeah okay,08:33.0,08:38.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4193,12,2,S1 ,,yeah pause filler okay you just (inaudible) that,08:40.0,08:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4194,12,2,S1 ,,pause filler so you try and get the x alone in every single situation,08:44.0,08:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4195,12,2,S1 ,,and to get pause filler this x alone you have to do pause filler three sevenths times seven to get rid of the three sevenths part so what you do,08:48.0,08:55.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4196,12,2,S1 ,well you got to multiply it by seven thirds okay,,08:55.0,08:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4197,12,2,S1 ,,you can do that pause filler all the reciprocal times seven,09:00.0,09:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4198,12,2,T1 ,,,09:01.0,29:47.0,20:46.0,,,,,,
4199,12,2,T1 ,,,09:02.0,12:19.0,03:17.0,,,,,,
4200,12,2,T1 ,,because we bring out the three sevenths the seven thirds,09:06.0,09:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4201,12,2,T1 ,,I just get seven just like visualizing in my mind but pause filler,09:10.0,09:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4202,12,2,T1 ,well the (inaudible) that I got to multiply by seven which is what I do seven,,09:13.0,09:21.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4203,12,2,T1 ,,because I just like that��_s why I need to visualize it,09:21.0,09:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,SD
4204,12,2,T1 ,,but I can do it like that three seven x forty times seven,09:24.0,09:34.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4205,12,2,T1 ,you basically take forty,,09:35.0,09:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4206,12,2,T1 ,,forty you get x,09:39.0,09:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4207,12,2,T1 ,seven (inaudible),,09:44.0,09:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4208,12,2,T1 ,,you get forty,09:44.0,09:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4209,12,2,T1 ,,whoa what is happening with this eight times seven wait wait wait equals,09:48.0,10:00.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4210,12,2,T1 ,,oh my gosh this is challenging,10:02.0,10:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4211,12,2,T1 ,yeah because,,10:04.0,10:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4212,12,2,T1 ,,okay yeah she's like hard to write with the stylus thing is that��_s,10:05.0,10:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4213,12,2,T1 ,(inaudible) forty because (inaudible) right because (inaudible),,10:11.0,10:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4214,12,2,T1 ,,yeah what appears to be (inaudible) is you have to do pause filler like,10:15.0,10:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4215,12,2,T1 ,,you do forty over three and then like the times seven over three and pause filler,10:18.0,10:24.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4216,12,2,T1 ,,you're going to do the cross prog docs wait oh wait (inaudible),10:24.0,10:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4217,12,2,T1 ,well this is (inaudible),,10:26.0,10:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4218,12,2,T1 ,,if you do this because actually what you can do here is you can cross out like,10:28.0,10:35.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4219,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler you can cross out both those threes,10:35.0,10:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4220,12,2,T1 ,,you get ones on both sides,10:38.0,10:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4221,12,2,T1 ,,I think that works,10:41.0,10:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4222,12,2,T1 ,well but do twenty-three over one times three over seven,,10:46.0,10:53.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4223,12,2,T1 ,because forty-one is the same as fifty-one,,10:53.0,10:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4224,12,2,T1 ,,yes forty I knew seven times one and forty times three,10:56.0,10:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4225,12,2,T1 ,,you get one twenty time seven yeah,10:59.0,11:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4226,12,2,T1 ,two hundred eighty,,11:02.0,11:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4227,12,2,T1 ,,one twenty times seven is,11:07.0,11:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4228,12,2,T1 ,over three two hundred eighty over three times x,,11:09.0,11:15.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4229,12,2,T1 ,,and you're going to do x,11:15.0,11:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4230,12,2,T1 ,,x equals two hundred eighty over three yeah,11:17.0,11:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4231,12,2,T1 ,did I get all that,,11:23.0,11:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4232,12,2,T1 ,,yeah mm-hmm because what happens what I do is I like cross this when I teach them,11:24.0,11:30.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4233,12,2,T1 ,,and you can cross out both the numbers,11:30.0,11:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4234,12,2,T1 ,,and so you just do like quicker answer,11:32.0,11:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4235,12,2,T1 ,,and it's more like simple way of doing it,11:36.0,11:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4236,12,2,T1 ,,because yeah you can cross out both those threes and just a little bit easier I think,11:40.0,11:45.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4237,12,2,T1 ,,but yeah you can do that one too so next page,11:45.0,11:51.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4238,12,2,T1 ,yeah (inaudible) so multiply time three time seven (inaudible),,11:52.0,12:00.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4239,12,2,T1 ,,you get check,12:01.0,12:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4240,12,2,T1 ,(inaudible) multiply it was equal again,,12:02.0,12:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4241,12,2,T1 ,so I know divided by,,12:03.0,12:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4242,12,2,T1 ,,yeah so I'd put over here,12:05.0,12:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4243,12,2,T1 ,,so that��_s three pause filler okay,12:06.0,12:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4244,12,2,T1 ,,three eight k equals fourteen,12:10.0,12:19.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4245,12,2,T1 ,,,12:19.0,14:56.0,02:37.0,,,,,,
4246,12,2,T1 ,,okay what should we do here is work out by the reciprocal pause filler eight thirds yeah that��_s right eight thirds,12:20.0,12:30.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4247,12,2,T1 ,,so you get k equals fourteen times eight thirds,12:30.0,12:43.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
4248,12,2,T1 ,yeah and eight thirds fourteen is basically the same as fourteen over one right,,12:43.0,12:49.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4249,12,2,T1 ,,mm-hmm yeah because when you get cross products which is pause filler it's eight time one which is like eight yeah,12:49.0,12:55.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4250,12,2,T1 ,,and you have pause filler k equals eight times fourteen times,12:55.0,13:04.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4251,12,2,T1 ,yeah fourteen times eight,,13:06.0,13:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4252,12,2,T1 ,,ops wow oh my gosh two as forty-two and you got eight time forty-two which is pause filler,13:08.0,13:20.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4253,12,2,T1 ,oh what you can get is like that��_s eighty,,13:20.0,13:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4254,12,2,T1 ,so it's eighty,,13:24.0,13:30.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4255,12,2,T1 ,and then four times eight is thirty-two,,13:30.0,13:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4256,12,2,T1 ,mm-hmm,,13:34.0,13:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4257,12,2,T1 ,it's thirty-two (inaudible),,13:36.0,13:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4258,12,2,T1 ,and then eight time eight plus thirty-two is (inaudible),,13:38.0,13:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4259,12,2,T1 ,,okay wait did you get pause filler the,13:42.0,13:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4260,12,2,T1 ,,I'm not sure what the property is called,13:44.0,13:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4261,12,2,T1 ,,but did you like the one property where like anything times up yeah yeah yeah I understand,13:46.0,13:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4262,12,2,T1 ,one hundred twelve right,,13:51.0,13:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4263,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler yeah yeah yeah,13:53.0,13:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4264,12,2,T1 ,yeah so it's (inaudible),,13:55.0,13:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4265,12,2,T1 ,,mm-hmm yeah so,13:56.0,13:56.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4266,12,2,T1 ,and then you get hundred twelve over eight is the answer,,13:57.0,14:05.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4267,12,2,T1 ,,(inaudible),14:04.0,14:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4268,12,2,T1 ,,okay,14:05.0,14:05.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4269,12,2,T1 ,,yeah that��_s yeah it's just a different way of doing way,14:08.0,14:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4270,12,2,T1 ,,my math teacher taught me,14:12.0,14:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4271,12,2,T1 ,,that was different from what's probably has in the packet,14:14.0,14:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4272,12,2,T1 ,,yeah so let's do the next page,14:17.0,14:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4273,12,2,T1 ,yeah,,14:22.0,14:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4274,12,2,T1 ,,okay pause filler negative two thirds y minus eighteen equals okay I got it,14:23.0,14:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4275,12,2,T1 ,so we need to (inaudible) forty-two equals (inaudible),,14:27.0,14:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4276,12,2,T1 ,,yeah or what I do is you add eighteen to both sides,14:30.0,14:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4277,12,2,T1 ,,so yeah to get on fifty-two plus eighteen which is seventy you get,14:34.0,14:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4278,12,2,T1 ,,(inaudible),14:38.0,14:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4279,12,2,T1 ,,you get negative two thirds y equals oh my gosh,14:39.0,14:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4280,12,2,T1 ,,so it's all right I think seventy,14:45.0,14:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4281,12,2,T1 ,yeah,,14:48.0,14:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4282,12,2,T1 ,,actually seventy pause filler so then you do look at them times okay times oh wow,14:49.0,14:58.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4283,12,2,T1 ,,,14:57.0,17:20.0,02:23.0,,,,,,
4284,12,2,T1 ,we've done negative three (inaudible) right,,14:58.0,15:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4285,12,2,T1 ,,yeah it takes,15:00.0,15:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4286,12,2,T1 ,,okay here we go,15:03.0,15:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4287,12,2,T1 ,,at least we've done now yes,15:05.0,15:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4288,12,2,T1 ,,so we do pause filler times three (inaudible),15:06.0,15:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4289,12,2,T1 ,,and so you get negative y by itself which is,15:08.0,15:16.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4290,12,2,T1 ,,you get y by itself which,15:16.0,15:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4291,12,2,T1 ,,you get negative thirds times negative three has excuse me pause filler,15:18.0,15:25.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4292,12,2,T1 ,,and so you get like y,15:25.0,15:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4293,12,2,T1 ,y equals,,15:28.0,15:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4294,12,2,T1 ,,y equals like pause filler seventy minus three halves seventy,15:29.0,15:35.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4295,12,2,T1 ,so it would be negative,,15:36.0,15:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4296,12,2,T1 ,,then seventy minus three pause filler,15:39.0,15:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4297,12,2,T1 ,well multiply it by negative (inaudible),,15:42.0,15:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4298,12,2,T1 ,,yeah times I mean we multiply,15:45.0,15:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4299,12,2,T1 ,,I guess yeah but,15:49.0,15:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4300,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler so you do that,15:51.0,15:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4301,12,2,T1 ,,so you have three halves,15:52.0,15:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4302,12,2,T1 ,,multiply it by seventy which is like at times are like one and a half so like seven yeah seventy (inaudible) yeah a hundred,15:54.0,16:09.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
4303,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler because it's half of seven,16:10.0,16:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4304,12,2,T1 ,yeah hundred five,,16:12.0,16:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4305,12,2,T1 ,,so you have the negative pause filler y yeah yeah yeah yeah,16:13.0,16:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4306,12,2,T1 ,,so y equals negative hundred and five,16:17.0,16:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4307,12,2,T1 ,okay,,16:20.0,16:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4308,12,2,T1 ,,yup okay pause filler yeah I got okay,16:21.0,16:30.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4309,12,2,T1 ,,so you got one so hey,16:30.0,16:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4310,12,2,T1 ,,you got pause filler minus half x plus fifteen minus thirteen,16:34.0,16:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4311,12,2,T1 ,,you go forty-four minus thirteen which equals wait thirty-one,16:38.0,16:43.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4312,12,2,T1 ,,so you have one half x x equals thirty-one,16:43.0,16:55.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4313,12,2,T1 ,,and then pause filler what you do is you like find,16:55.0,16:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4314,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler you times two,16:59.0,17:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4315,12,2,T1 ,,because you times two over one is two,17:02.0,17:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4316,12,2,T1 ,,so you do times two,17:06.0,17:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4317,12,2,T1 ,,and then you have the thirty-one over there,17:07.0,17:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4318,12,2,T1 ,,and so you have x equal wait,17:09.0,17:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4319,12,2,T1 ,,x equals pause filler thirty-one times two,17:12.0,17:21.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4320,12,2,T1 ,,,17:21.0,18:34.0,01:13.0,,,,,,
4321,12,2,T1 ,,and then thirty-one times two x equals sixty-two,17:21.0,17:29.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4322,12,2,T1 ,,yeah I have to go sixty-two yeah like twelve,17:29.0,17:34.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4323,12,2,T1 ,,I'm sorry I can't remember,17:34.0,17:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4324,12,2,T1 ,,this is difficult to write on this thing Scribbler yeah,17:35.0,17:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4325,12,2,T1 ,,yup right I can't see the whole,17:39.0,17:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4326,12,2,T1 ,,I'm not sure it happened like I think,17:45.0,17:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4327,12,2,T1 ,,(inaudible),17:48.0,17:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4328,12,2,T1 ,,I need to go over here for one second pause filler go over yeah,17:49.0,18:23.0,00:34.0,,,,,,
4329,12,2,T1 ,,I think I got it,18:23.0,18:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4330,12,2,T1 ,,I'm not sure if I did,18:25.0,18:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4331,12,2,T1 ,,but I think this is going to work for now okay,18:26.0,18:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4332,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler so I got thirty-one equals negative sixteen plus three six x,18:29.0,18:35.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4333,12,2,T1 ,,okay that��_s right pretty good,18:35.0,18:36.0,00:01.0,,,,UL,,
4334,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler I'll make sure that this is the right one,18:36.0,18:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4335,12,2,T1 ,,,18:37.0,21:01.0,02:24.0,,,,,,
4336,12,2,T1 ,,so what you do is you have to pause filler add sixteen on both sides,18:38.0,18:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4337,12,2,T1 ,,so you have the thirty-one plus sixteen which is forty-seven yeah,18:42.0,18:49.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4338,12,2,T1 ,,so you have forty-seven,18:49.0,18:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4339,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler but forty-seven equals three six x,18:56.0,19:03.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4340,12,2,T1 ,not spaced at the same,,19:03.0,19:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4341,12,2,T1 ,,it's one half yeah,19:04.0,19:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4342,12,2,T1 ,,that��_s what I imagined it so,19:06.0,19:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4343,12,2,T1 ,so then (inaudible),,19:10.0,19:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4344,12,2,T1 ,,yeah so you have forty-seven over there,19:11.0,19:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4345,12,2,T1 ,,and then you multiply by two on the right side,19:13.0,19:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4346,12,2,T1 ,,so you have pause filler,19:17.0,19:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4347,12,2,T1 ,,so you have one half x minus one half x minus sorry yeah times two one half x time two,19:18.0,19:30.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4348,12,2,T1 ,,that��_s forty-seven times two like forty-seven times two,19:30.0,19:40.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4349,12,2,T1 ,,you get ninety-four,19:40.0,19:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4350,12,2,T1 ,mm-hmm so x equals ninety-four,,19:41.0,19:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4351,12,2,T1 ,,yeah so x equals ninety-four yeah,19:44.0,19:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4352,12,2,T1 ,okay next page,,19:51.0,19:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4353,12,2,T1 ,,you got it,19:52.0,19:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4354,12,2,T1 ,okay,,19:55.0,19:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4355,12,2,T1 ,,you have here this is good yeah okay,19:56.0,19:59.0,00:03.0,,,,UL,,
4356,12,2,T1 ,,so you have pause filler negative twelve over five y plus forty-eight equals ninety-seven,19:59.0,20:05.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4357,12,2,T1 ,,so you minus those sides by four,20:05.0,20:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4358,12,2,T1 ,,subtract both sides by forty-eight,20:09.0,20:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4359,12,2,T1 ,,you have three minus forty-eight and ninety-seven minus forty-eight,20:11.0,20:16.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4360,12,2,T1 ,,so you get pause filler forty-nine,20:16.0,20:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4361,12,2,T1 ,,so you basically you have pause filler negative,20:19.0,20:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4362,12,2,T1 ,,what did I just do,20:24.0,20:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4363,12,2,T1 ,,here you go,20:28.0,20:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4364,12,2,T1 ,,yeah that��_s better negative twelve five y,20:29.0,20:36.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4365,12,2,T1 ,,I said wait,20:37.0,20:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4366,12,2,T1 ,,what did I say again,20:37.0,20:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4367,12,2,T1 ,,is it eighty-two right or forty-two what I said,20:38.0,20:43.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4368,12,2,T1 ,you were talking forty-eight,,20:43.0,20:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4369,12,2,T1 ,,you were pause filler,20:45.0,20:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4370,12,2,T1 ,,you have ninety,20:46.0,20:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4371,12,2,T1 ,,and you have pause filler,20:48.0,20:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4372,12,2,T1 ,,it's forty-eight okay,20:49.0,20:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4373,12,2,T1 ,,so then you have the nine,20:51.0,20:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4374,12,2,T1 ,,and then you have pause filler forty-nine yeah,20:53.0,20:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4375,12,2,T1 ,you have forty-nine mm-hmm,,20:58.0,21:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4376,12,2,T1 ,,yeah therefore so you equals forty-nine,21:00.0,21:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4377,12,2,T1 ,,,21:02.0,24:56.0,03:54.0,,,,,,
4378,12,2,T1 ,,you get zero here,21:04.0,21:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4379,12,2,T1 ,,you get the time by twelve fifths pause filler both sides over here,21:06.0,21:15.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4380,12,2,T1 ,,you multiply,21:15.0,21:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4381,12,2,T1 ,wait (inaudible),,21:18.0,21:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4382,12,2,T1 ,,yeah oh that��_s reciprocal,21:19.0,21:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4383,12,2,T1 ,,oh it's twelve five twelfths by,21:21.0,21:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4384,12,2,T1 ,negative five twelfths though,,21:23.0,21:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4385,12,2,T1 ,,yeah five twelfths negative five twelfths pause filler over here we have to do negative five twelfths but pause filler on the regular,21:27.0,21:39.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4386,12,2,T1 ,,you end up getting pause filler y,21:39.0,21:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4387,12,2,T1 ,,because you did negative time negative which is a positive,21:42.0,21:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4388,12,2,T1 ,,so you have positive right equals,21:45.0,21:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4389,12,2,T1 ,wait,,21:50.0,21:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4390,12,2,T1 ,,no no no,21:50.0,21:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4391,12,2,T1 ,it's positive so then,,21:50.0,21:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4392,12,2,T1 ,,yeah no yeah on the right side yeah forty-nine is a positive yeah yeah yeah yeah,21:54.0,21:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4393,12,2,T1 ,,because over here you have forty-nine (inaudible) equals forty-nine times negative five twelve yeah,21:57.0,22:05.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4394,12,2,T1 ,,I'll turn the left side on that part twelve pause filler,22:06.0,22:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4395,12,2,T1 ,,okay so you have pause filler,22:09.0,22:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4396,12,2,T1 ,,so you have y equals forty-nine times five twelfths,22:11.0,22:17.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4397,12,2,T1 ,,five twelfths is pause filler supposed the half of forty-eight,22:17.0,22:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4398,12,2,T1 ,,half of forty-eight is pause filler it's twenty-four and,22:23.0,22:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4399,12,2,T1 ,yeah it's close to twenty-four but,,22:26.0,22:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4400,12,2,T1 ,,yeah mm-hmm it's close to twenty-four,22:28.0,22:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4401,12,2,T1 ,,but it's not twenty-four pause filler yeah,22:31.0,22:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4402,12,2,T1 ,,it's one wait pause filler right pause filler okay,22:33.0,22:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4403,12,2,T1 ,it's two hundred forty-five negative twelve (inaudible),,22:36.0,22:46.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4404,12,2,T1 ,,you're doing forty-five by five,22:48.0,22:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4405,12,2,T1 ,and then (inaudible) negative twelve,,22:51.0,22:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4406,12,2,T1 ,,over twelve yeah I'm talking about,22:53.0,22:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

4421,12,2,T1 ,,okay here we go pause filler,23:44.0,23:57.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
4422,12,2,T1 ,,it's plus y so,23:57.0,23:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4423,12,2,T1 ,so before we plus y we should (inaudible) numbers,,23:58.0,24:03.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4424,12,2,T1 ,,what it is,24:03.0,24:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4425,12,2,T1 ,,it's pause filler on the right side,24:06.0,24:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4426,12,2,T1 ,,it says twenty-five plus y,24:11.0,24:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4427,12,2,T1 ,yes,,24:15.0,24:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4428,12,2,T1 ,,I want to make sure (inaudible),24:16.0,24:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4429,12,2,T1 ,,because I couldn't see that either,24:17.0,24:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4430,12,2,T1 ,,okay so what you do is pause filler,24:22.0,24:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4431,12,2,T1 ,,so the negative six seventh minus y sixty-one I mean pause filler so you need to do plus sixty-one,24:24.0,24:30.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4432,12,2,T1 ,,so you do twenty-five plus sixty-one which equals pause filler,24:30.0,24:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4433,12,2,T1 ,,I'm sorry eighty-six eighty-six plus y,24:33.0,24:38.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4434,12,2,T1 ,,and then what you do over here is,24:38.0,24:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4435,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler I think you would pause filler,24:42.0,24:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4436,12,2,T1 ,you drop off,,24:45.0,24:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4437,12,2,T1 ,,yeah I think you should pause filler,24:46.0,24:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4438,12,2,T1 ,,would you add six sevenths over y,24:48.0,24:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4439,12,2,T1 ,,or would you I think,24:52.0,24:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4440,12,2,T1 ,,let's just minus y,24:54.0,24:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4441,12,2,T1 ,,that would be a lot easier,24:55.0,24:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4442,12,2,T1 ,,,24:56.0,29:47.0,04:51.0,,,,,,
4443,12,2,T1 ,yeah,,24:57.0,24:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4444,12,2,T1 ,,yeah okay,24:57.0,24:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4445,12,2,T1 ,yeah we know eighty-six is on this side,,24:58.0,25:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4446,12,2,T1 ,,mm-hmm so you have eighty-six on the right-hand side and yeah just,25:00.0,25:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4447,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler and you minus y on the right side too,25:05.0,25:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4448,12,2,T1 ,,and you get pause filler so,25:08.0,25:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4449,12,2,T1 ,,you get negative six over seven two y equals eighty-six yeah,25:10.0,25:25.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
4450,12,2,T1 ,,and then what you do is you have to,25:25.0,25:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4451,12,2,T1 ,well by subtracting by y I think,,25:27.0,25:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4452,12,2,T1 ,(inaudible) subtract it,,25:32.0,25:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4453,12,2,T1 ,,oh yeah so I add y,25:33.0,25:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4454,12,2,T1 ,,you subtract y so yeah,25:35.0,25:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4455,12,2,T1 ,,so it's just six sevenths equals eighty-six oh wait,25:37.0,25:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4456,12,2,T1 ,,no so you're subtracting six sevenths,25:41.0,25:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4457,12,2,T1 ,well wait we're subtracting y,,25:44.0,25:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4458,12,2,T1 ,,yeah,25:46.0,25:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4459,12,2,T1 ,well we're subtracting y,,25:47.0,25:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4460,12,2,T1 ,then that��_s well the answer would be one seventh y,,25:50.0,25:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4461,12,2,T1 ,,oh yeah because you're left with pause filler the,25:54.0,25:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4462,12,2,T1 ,,because you got okay,25:57.0,26:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4463,12,2,T1 ,,because you subtract the y,26:00.0,26:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4464,12,2,T1 ,because (inaudible) oh you're subtracting,,26:02.0,26:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4465,12,2,T1 ,so that basically (inaudible) subtracting y so basically (inaudible),,26:04.0,26:12.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4466,12,2,T1 ,,yeah,26:12.0,26:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4467,12,2,T1 ,yeah,,26:15.0,26:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4468,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler yeah I understand,26:16.0,26:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4469,12,2,T1 ,,because actually I added it,26:17.0,26:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4470,12,2,T1 ,,and I understand which led me to completely on our own track,26:20.0,26:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4471,12,2,T1 ,yeah so it's negative fifteen yeah negative fifteen (inaudible),,26:23.0,26:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4472,12,2,T1 ,and then we're going to take the reciprocal of that,,26:28.0,26:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4473,12,2,T1 ,,the reciprocal pause filler negative fifteen over seven y is pause filler seven,26:33.0,26:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4474,12,2,T1 ,,oh it's like negative seven over fifteen which is like pause filler basically the same thing,26:39.0,26:47.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4475,12,2,T1 ,,because it doesn��_t matter where like the minus is,26:47.0,26:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4476,12,2,T1 ,,so you have the y on the one side,26:50.0,26:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4477,12,2,T1 ,,so you have y equals eighty-six times,26:53.0,27:03.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4478,12,2,T1 ,seven over negative fifteen,,27:03.0,27:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4479,12,2,T1 ,,so you have y,27:12.0,27:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4480,12,2,T1 ,,so y equals eighty-six minus negative seven over fifteen,27:13.0,27:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4481,12,2,T1 ,,okay so we're there now,27:18.0,27:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4482,12,2,T1 ,,and pause filler we could do eighty-six over one,27:20.0,27:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4483,12,2,T1 ,,the negative seven minus one equals negative seven,27:26.0,27:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4484,12,2,T1 ,multiply,,27:30.0,27:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4485,12,2,T1 ,,yeah we're going to multiply negative seven over y,27:31.0,27:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4486,12,2,T1 ,,multiplying negative seven times one and eighteen times one is the same thing,27:35.0,27:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4487,12,2,T1 ,well we're going to multiply (inaudible),,27:40.0,27:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4488,12,2,T1 ,,oh yeah the reciprocal okay yeah so then eighty-six times negative seven okay which is pause filler eight-six times wow (laughter),27:44.0,27:58.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
4489,12,2,T1 ,oh thank you,,28:43.0,28:53.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4490,12,2,T1 ,okay (inaudible),,28:54.0,28:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4491,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler there's like a slit at the top,28:54.0,29:17.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
4492,12,2,T1 ,okay,,29:17.0,29:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4493,12,2,T1 ,,(inaudible) I went to Kennywood yesterday,29:17.0,29:29.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4494,12,2,T1 ,,pause filler because it was our Hayward Day and,29:30.0,31:16.0,01:46.0,,,,,,
4495,12,2,S2 ,,,31:14.0,36:36.0,05:22.0,,,,,,
4496,12,2,S2 ,,pause filler a lot of the rides were really like fun,31:16.0,31:21.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4497,12,2,S2 ,,and you see head bikes kind of,31:21.0,31:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4498,12,2,S2 ,,it's a lot like pause filler like the (inaudible),31:24.0,31:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4499,12,2,S2 ,,you know at Hayward the fact that you do that stuff mm-hmm is school after the Hayward Day,31:30.0,32:46.0,01:16.0,,,,,,
4500,12,2,S2 ,,hey,32:53.0,32:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4501,12,2,S2 ,okay so,,35:47.0,35:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4502,12,2,S2 ,,okay yeah,35:48.0,35:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4503,12,2,S2 ,here pause filler we multiply pause filler okay (inaudible) multiply it by x go for one right,,35:50.0,36:03.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
4504,12,2,S2 ,,well here doesn��_t have the x number one,36:03.0,36:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4505,12,2,S2 ,,I have to multiply by x,36:08.0,36:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4506,12,2,S2 ,,and everything is a little bit easier,36:12.0,36:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4507,12,2,S2 ,,yeah the answer has been (inaudible),36:15.0,36:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4508,12,2,S2 ,,because we solve right,36:16.0,36:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4509,12,2,S2 ,,you just have to write x in your extra one,36:19.0,36:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4510,12,2,S2 ,mm-hmm so then you get,,36:22.0,36:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4511,12,2,S2 ,,actually (inaudible) yeah mm-hmm,36:23.0,36:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4512,12,2,S2 ,so then one over negative five right,,36:26.0,36:31.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4513,12,2,S2 ,,mm-hmm yeah because you would get to the other side too x one (inaudible) yeah mm-hmm okay next page okay okay,36:33.0,36:49.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
4514,12,2,S2 ,don��_t you add seventeen okay,,36:51.0,36:57.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4515,12,2,S2 ,just do y equals eighty,,36:59.0,37:07.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4516,12,2,S2 ,,yeah,37:08.0,37:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4517,12,2,S2 ,and then,,37:12.0,37:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4518,12,2,S2 ,,yeah what's next,37:14.0,37:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4519,12,2,S2 ,you multiply it by y right,,37:17.0,37:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4520,12,2,S2 ,,yeah that��_s right,37:20.0,37:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4521,12,2,S2 ,,yeah you multiply by y on both sides yeah,37:21.0,37:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4522,12,2,S2 ,so then four multiplied by y you get negative three (inaudible),,37:25.0,37:33.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4523,12,2,S2 ,,mm-hmm yeah you multiply by the denominator,37:33.0,37:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4524,12,2,S2 ,,and y was the denominator,37:35.0,37:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4525,12,2,S2 ,,so you have to (inaudible) though,37:37.0,37:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4526,12,2,S2 ,okay negative three and then equals eighty times y,,37:39.0,37:53.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
4527,12,2,T2 ,,,37:49.0,58:05.0,20:16.0,,,,,,
4528,12,2,T2 ,,,37:49.0,38:47.0,00:58.0,,,,,,
4529,12,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm wait pause filler you do eight times three wait wait wait wait wait,37:58.0,38:10.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4530,12,2,T2 ,so then you divide by eighty (inaudible),,38:10.0,38:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4531,12,2,T2 ,,yeah I saw twenty-five there,38:14.0,38:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4532,12,2,T2 ,yeah and then so then you get x (inaudible) over eight equals y,,38:20.0,38:31.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
4533,12,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm yeah,38:31.0,38:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4534,12,2,T2 ,let me just (inaudible),,38:32.0,38:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4535,12,2,T2 ,,oh yeah that��_s right,38:37.0,38:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4536,12,2,T2 ,,okay I'm going to (inaudible) over here,38:39.0,38:46.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4537,12,2,T2 ,,,38:47.0,41:09.0,02:22.0,,,,,,
4538,12,2,T2 ,okay,,38:47.0,38:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4539,12,2,T2 ,,yup right yeah,38:49.0,38:56.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4540,12,2,T2 ,okay so (inaudible) subtract four (inaudible),,38:56.0,39:03.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4541,12,2,T2 ,four over k equals pause filler three,,39:03.0,39:14.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
4542,12,2,T2 ,okay,,39:14.0,39:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4543,12,2,T2 ,,yeah,39:16.0,39:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4544,12,2,T2 ,mm-hmm,,39:16.0,39:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4545,12,2,T2 ,then I multiply eight,,39:17.0,39:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4546,12,2,T2 ,and you get four equals sixty-two eight and then negative two,,39:21.0,39:36.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
4547,12,2,T2 ,,yeah,39:40.0,39:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4548,12,2,T2 ,and then (inaudible) is four over sixty-two,,39:41.0,39:48.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4549,12,2,T2 ,,pause filler yeah that's right,39:48.0,39:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4550,12,2,T2 ,okay,,39:51.0,39:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4551,12,2,T2 ,,yeah next page,39:53.0,39:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4552,12,2,T2 ,okay,,39:54.0,39:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4553,12,2,T2 ,,well yeah I'll go back,39:57.0,39:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4554,12,2,T2 ,,I got it,39:58.0,40:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4555,12,2,T2 ,,I got it,40:00.0,40:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4556,12,2,T2 ,,here you go,40:02.0,40:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4557,12,2,T2 ,yeah so if you multiply y plus x okay,,40:04.0,40:08.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4558,12,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm next you multiply by the denominator,40:08.0,40:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4559,12,2,T2 ,mm-hmm so you get ten y equals fourteen negative ten,,40:12.0,40:21.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4560,12,2,T2 ,I didn't think of fourteen fourteen divided by ten,,40:22.0,40:37.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
4561,12,2,T2 ,,yeah because you're dividing the two hundred ten by both sides and yeah no need to simplify got it pause filler next page but yeah wait,40:37.0,40:55.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
4562,12,2,T2 ,so add twenty-four,,40:56.0,40:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4563,12,2,T2 ,and one hundred thirty-two equals five over x and multiplied by x divided by one hundred negative ten x,,40:59.0,41:25.0,00:26.0,,,,,,
4564,12,2,T2 ,,,41:09.0,42:03.0,00:54.0,,,,,,
4565,12,2,T2 ,,yeah because there are more x,41:26.0,41:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4566,12,2,T2 ,and that equals five equals seven,,41:28.0,41:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4567,12,2,T2 ,and then get five over one thirty-seven,,41:33.0,41:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4568,12,2,T2 ,,one thirty-seven yeah actually it's equal x equals five one thirty-seven one thirty-seven yeah,41:36.0,41:44.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4569,12,2,T2 ,,okay yeah let's go,41:44.0,41:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4570,12,2,T2 ,okay,,41:48.0,41:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4571,12,2,T2 ,,oh my,41:49.0,41:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4572,12,2,T2 ,so add twenty-nine plus ten,,41:54.0,42:04.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4573,12,2,T2 ,,,42:03.0,42:58.0,00:55.0,,,,,,
4574,12,2,T2 ,it's seventeen,,42:05.0,42:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4575,12,2,T2 ,,oh actually I think it would be easier to like,42:06.0,42:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4576,12,2,T2 ,,pause filler well it depends,42:11.0,42:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4577,12,2,T2 ,,do you like to prefer working with negatives or positives,42:13.0,42:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4578,12,2,T2 ,it doesn��_t matter,,42:17.0,42:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4579,12,2,T2 ,,okay yeah so continue what you're doing,42:18.0,42:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4580,12,2,T2 ,,I prefer to work with like however,42:21.0,42:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4581,12,2,T2 ,,the number originally was,42:24.0,42:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4582,12,2,T2 ,,it doesn��_t matter,42:26.0,42:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4583,12,2,T2 ,okay pause filler so then equals fourteen over x equals x over x (inaudible) by adding eighteen,,42:28.0,42:47.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
4584,12,2,T2 ,,yeah like add that number,42:52.0,42:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4585,12,2,T2 ,,and get that subtract down and,42:54.0,42:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4586,12,2,T2 ,subtract twelve over x right,,42:58.0,43:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4587,12,2,T2 ,,,42:59.0,43:58.0,00:59.0,,,,,,
4588,12,2,T2 ,,yeah both sides,43:01.0,43:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4589,12,2,T2 ,mm-hmm and then negative five over x equals eighteen,,43:02.0,43:09.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4590,12,2,T2 ,,yeah then you have what to both sides,43:09.0,43:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4591,12,2,T2 ,multiply by x,,43:13.0,43:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4592,12,2,T2 ,,yeah mm-hmm,43:14.0,43:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4593,12,2,T2 ,yeah okay so then you get eighteen x equals five,,43:15.0,43:22.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4594,12,2,T2 ,and then you divide it by eighteen,,43:22.0,43:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4595,12,2,T2 ,and then five over eighteen equals x,,43:26.0,43:31.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4596,12,2,T2 ,,yes,43:31.0,43:31.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4597,12,2,T2 ,okay are you okay,,43:32.0,43:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4598,12,2,T2 ,,excuse me yeah I just had a little cough,43:33.0,43:38.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4599,12,2,T2 ,,okay pause filler I'll go the next page here (sfx) okay,43:38.0,43:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4600,12,2,T2 ,so here I'm going to add ninety-two to both sides,,43:45.0,43:53.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4601,12,2,T2 ,,pause filler yeah go yeah you do that,43:54.0,43:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4602,12,2,T2 ,,yeah that��_s would be the best option,43:57.0,43:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4603,12,2,T2 ,twenty-three over x equals a hundred three plus twelve over x,,43:59.0,44:19.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
4604,12,2,T2 ,,,44:01.0,45:55.0,01:54.0,,,,,,
4605,12,2,T2 ,and then I'm going to subtract both over x one both sides,,44:20.0,44:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4606,12,2,T2 ,and then I'll get pause filler negative nine over x,,44:34.0,44:52.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
4607,12,2,T2 ,(inaudible) what just happened,,44:54.0,44:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4608,12,2,T2 ,,yeah it's (inaudible),44:57.0,44:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4609,12,2,T2 ,negative nine over x equals one hundred three,,45:01.0,45:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4610,12,2,T2 ,,now what do you do here,45:09.0,45:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4611,12,2,T2 ,you multiply by x,,45:09.0,45:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4612,12,2,T2 ,you get one hundred three x,,45:12.0,45:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4613,12,2,T2 ,then you divide it by three to get negative nine over one hundred three,,45:14.0,45:21.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
4614,12,2,T2 ,,that all of the problems is that you get all of like the core concepts,45:22.0,45:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4615,12,2,T2 ,,and like add subtract then you divide mm-hmm,45:27.0,45:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4616,12,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm,45:29.0,45:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4617,12,2,T2 ,,get yeah let's go to number,45:30.0,45:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4618,12,2,T2 ,okay eight and I solve here,,45:35.0,45:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4619,12,2,T2 ,we'll subtract twenty-five divided by positive (inaudible),,45:41.0,45:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4620,12,2,T2 ,mm-hmm,,45:46.0,45:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4621,12,2,T2 ,pause filler so one over x plus twenty-five equals (inaudible) over x,,45:54.0,46:07.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
4622,12,2,T2 ,,,45:55.0,47:56.0,02:01.0,,,,,,
4623,12,2,T2 ,then you subtract to eleven over x,,46:09.0,46:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4624,12,2,T2 ,you get eight over x right,,46:13.0,46:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4625,12,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm one over x,46:16.0,46:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4626,12,2,T2 ,equals eighty-five then multiply it by x,,46:17.0,46:25.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4627,12,2,T2 ,you get thirty-five x (inaudible) eight over twenty-five,,46:26.0,46:32.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4628,12,2,T2 ,okay,,46:32.0,46:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4629,12,2,T2 ,,pause filler all right I want you to go right there,46:32.0,46:43.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
4630,12,2,T2 ,mm-hmm,,46:36.0,46:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4631,12,2,T2 ,,pause filler wait yeah it doesn��_t say anything about pause filler simplest form so this and this yeah okay,46:43.0,46:55.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4632,12,2,T2 ,okay so we got twenty-two (inaudible),,46:56.0,47:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4633,12,2,T2 ,one hundred three and seven over x equals nine over x,,47:00.0,47:18.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
4634,12,2,T2 ,so we're going to subtract ten over x (inaudible),,47:20.0,47:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4635,12,2,T2 ,and then you get one hundred (inaudible),,47:26.0,47:39.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
4636,12,2,T2 ,right one hundred eight equals negative one over x,,47:40.0,47:53.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
4637,12,2,T2 ,so then (inaudible) multiply by x (inaudible),,47:53.0,47:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4638,12,2,T2 ,three x equals negative one and divided by one hundred three to get negative one over a hundred right,,47:56.0,48:11.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
4639,12,2,T2 ,,,47:56.0,49:21.0,01:25.0,,,,,,
4640,12,2,T2 ,mm-hmm,,48:11.0,48:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4641,12,2,T2 ,okay,,48:12.0,48:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4642,12,2,T2 ,,I have one okay okay,48:13.0,48:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4643,12,2,T2 ,,(sfx) here we go,48:20.0,48:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4644,12,2,T2 ,okay pause filler so I'm going to add a hundred eight (inaudible) and then get (inaudible) equals three hundred four equals forty,,48:22.0,48:59.0,00:37.0,,,,,,
4645,12,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm yeah yeah,49:00.0,49:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4646,12,2,T2 ,plus six plus (inaudible) one hundred six over x to both sides get negative eleven over x equals three hundred forty,,49:02.0,49:33.0,00:31.0,,,,,,
4647,12,2,T2 ,,,49:21.0,50:39.0,01:18.0,,,,,,
4648,12,2,T2 ,so then multiply it by x,,49:34.0,49:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4649,12,2,T2 ,forty-eight equals negative eleven and then negative forty (inaudible) over three hundred four,,49:37.0,49:48.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
4650,12,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm yeah I see,49:49.0,49:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4651,12,2,T2 ,,it was negative eleven over three hundred four yeah,49:50.0,49:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4652,12,2,T2 ,,okay yeah what we're going to do here we just keep on going,49:54.0,50:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4653,12,2,T2 ,,because we know there's more problems okay,50:00.0,50:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4654,12,2,T2 ,okay,,50:02.0,50:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4655,12,2,T2 ,,cool,50:03.0,50:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4656,12,2,T2 ,don��_t touch the left length,,50:05.0,50:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4657,12,2,T2 ,,yeah I would go and then come yeah,50:08.0,50:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4658,12,2,T2 ,okay,,50:11.0,50:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4659,12,2,T2 ,,okay,50:12.0,50:12.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4660,12,2,T2 ,so (inaudible) twenty here,,50:12.0,50:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4661,12,2,T2 ,so I get a positive number,,50:15.0,50:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4662,12,2,T2 ,I get seven,,50:25.0,50:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4663,12,2,T2 ,negative two over x equals ten over three x,,50:35.0,50:51.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
4664,12,2,T2 ,,,50:39.0,52:24.0,01:45.0,,,,,,
4665,12,2,T2 ,and then pause filler add two over three x to both sides,,50:54.0,51:09.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
4666,12,2,T2 ,and get twelve over three over three x equals seven,,51:11.0,51:35.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
4667,12,2,T2 ,so then you multiply the x,,51:37.0,51:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4668,12,2,T2 ,,yeah,51:42.0,51:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4669,12,2,T2 ,you get twenty both here,,51:44.0,51:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4670,12,2,T2 ,one x equals twelve divided by one both sides,,51:49.0,52:04.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
4671,12,2,T2 ,,negative x equals o over twenty-one,52:08.0,52:20.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
4672,12,2,T2 ,,yup,52:23.0,52:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4673,12,2,T2 ,well that��_s a lot of light,,52:24.0,52:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4674,12,2,T2 ,,yeah and I guess (inaudible) see any of that,52:27.0,52:35.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4675,12,2,T2 ,I (inaudible),,52:36.0,52:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4676,12,2,T2 ,,yeah I'm a big writer,52:37.0,52:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4677,12,2,T2 ,,but I can write perfectly well though,52:39.0,52:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4678,12,2,T2 ,,,52:42.0,55:00.0,02:18.0,,,,,,
4679,12,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),52:43.0,52:49.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4680,12,2,T2 ,,pause filler that��_s what I would do,52:49.0,52:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4681,12,2,T2 ,,you know on the right side you do pause filler seventy-three plus thirty-eight plus x,52:52.0,53:02.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
4682,12,2,T2 ,well even if we're multiplying we still do that,,53:04.0,53:10.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
4683,12,2,T2 ,,yeah because we're multiplying by x plus thirty-eight,53:10.0,53:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4684,12,2,T2 ,,so it's seventy-three time x plus thirty-eight,53:13.0,53:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
4685,12,2,T2 ,,so what I think is easier is that you add them together,53:17.0,53:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4686,12,2,T2 ,,because there's that x,53:20.0,53:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4687,12,2,T2 ,(inaudible) right,,53:22.0,53:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4688,12,2,T2 ,,pause filler yeah,53:23.0,53:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4689,12,2,T2 ,and then you get negative two equals one hundred eleven x,,53:23.0,53:34.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
4690,12,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),53:33.0,53:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
4691,12,2,T2 ,so twenty divided by one hundred eleven,,53:34.0,53:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4692,12,2,T2 ,mm-hmm,,53:36.0,53:45.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
4693,12,2,T2 ,,one hundred eleven yeah and x equals negative two over a hundred and eleven,53:42.0,53:55.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
4694,12,2,T2 ,yep,,53:55.0,53:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
4695,12,2,T2 ,,yep okay let's go to the next one okay,53:56.0,54:14.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
4696,12,2,T2 ,well so pause filler so I'd have to simplify this well (inaudible),,54:15.0,54:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
4697,12,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm I can do that yeah,54:18.0,54:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
4698,12,2,T2 ,yeah times two hundred twenty-five over x and nine divide (inaudible) wait equals ten x,,54:21.0,54:53.0,00:32.0,,,,,,
4699,12,2,T2 ,so there (inaudible) you get two hundred eighty-five x (inaudible) equals one seventy-seven,,54:54.0,55:18.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
4700,12,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm you just have to multiply by,55:18.0,55:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
4701,12,2,T2 ,,,55:21.0,56:33.0,01:12.0,,,,,,
4702,12,2,T2 ,yeah so multiply by x negative hi,,55:23.0,55:31.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
4703,12,2,T2 ,bye,,56:05.0,56:05.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

6542,16,1,S1 ,oh wait it's that you pretty much can want to look for and then no shit okay and then yeah pretty much,,04:15.0,04:29.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
6543,16,1,S1 ,you want to add here,,04:29.0,04:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6544,16,1,S1 ,and then from that you pretty much get,,04:31.0,04:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
6545,16,1,S1 ,,nineteen,04:37.0,04:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6546,16,1,S1 ,yeah (inaudible),,04:37.0,04:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6547,16,1,S1 ,,and how do you (inaudible),04:38.0,04:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6548,16,1,S1 ,pause filler I think wait I think I got it hold on,,04:39.0,04:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6549,16,1,S1 ,,oh oh oh I see,04:42.0,04:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6550,16,1,S1 ,yeah it's like a ball left that thing,,04:44.0,04:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6551,16,1,S1 ,okay so this is kind of like the same thing pretty much ouch,,04:49.0,05:05.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
6552,16,1,S1 ,so pretty much add here,,05:06.0,05:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6553,16,1,S1 ,you add this eight,,05:11.0,05:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6554,16,1,S1 ,that really worked but all right,,05:17.0,05:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
6555,16,1,S1 ,I love it,,05:23.0,05:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6556,16,1,S1 ,and then from that you get eight equals fifteen plus eight so,,05:24.0,05:29.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6557,16,1,S1 ,,twenty-three,05:29.0,05:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6558,16,1,S1 ,yeah so okay cool twenty-three yeah so that's turmoil kind of the same thing as the last one,,05:30.0,05:45.0,00:15.0,,,UL,,,
6559,16,1,S1 ,okay so this is kind of the same thing,,05:45.0,05:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6560,16,1,S1 ,but just you also track and still add so pretty much wait,,05:48.0,05:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6561,16,1,S1 ,,six,06:00.0,06:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6562,16,1,S1 ,oh great okay yeah actually all right okay so oh man okay so basically divide here and then yeah divided by thirty-four,,06:02.0,06:17.0,00:15.0,,,UL,,,
6563,16,1,T1 ,,,06:10.0,23:35.0,17:25.0,,,,,,
6564,16,1,T1 ,,,06:10.0,07:56.0,01:46.0,,,,,,
6565,16,1,T1 ,so x equals twenty-one,,06:17.0,06:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6566,16,1,T1 ,,there's a calculator,06:21.0,06:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6567,16,1,T1 ,there is,,06:22.0,06:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6568,16,1,T1 ,,I don't know,06:22.0,06:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6569,16,1,T1 ,,I was just saying man,06:23.0,06:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6570,16,1,T1 ,oh yeah well,,06:29.0,06:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6571,16,1,T1 ,,bless you bless you,06:29.0,06:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6572,16,1,T1 ,thanks okay I (inaudible) the calculator,,06:32.0,06:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6573,16,1,T1 ,because I think there's going on over there,,06:37.0,06:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6574,16,1,T1 ,okay we're done,,06:39.0,06:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6575,16,1,T1 ,pause filler x equals,,06:41.0,06:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6576,16,1,T1 ,pause filler this is,,06:41.0,06:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6577,16,1,T1 ,okay so x equals five,,06:41.0,06:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6578,16,1,T1 ,,what because forty five times five equals two twenty,06:45.0,06:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6579,16,1,T1 ,yeah pretty much so we get,,06:52.0,06:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
6580,16,1,T1 ,all right how do I,,06:58.0,06:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6581,16,1,T1 ,okay so pretty much in this first you want to add this,,06:59.0,07:06.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6582,16,1,T1 ,and then you get this,,07:09.0,07:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6583,16,1,T1 ,I don't know what happened,,07:15.0,07:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6584,16,1,T1 ,hold on pause filler,,07:17.0,07:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6585,16,1,T1 ,okay and then we get pause filler thirteen five so,,07:17.0,07:25.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
6586,16,1,T1 ,okay that was pretty bad,,07:26.0,07:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6587,16,1,T1 ,but I was close enough,,07:30.0,07:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6588,16,1,T1 ,and then we get,,07:32.0,07:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6589,16,1,T1 ,that is equals to forty-one plus nine which is fifty okay,,07:33.0,07:45.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
6590,16,1,T1 ,and then pretty much divide that out from here for thirteen because of really going with fifty okay so three and pause filler,,07:45.0,07:56.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
6591,16,1,T1 ,,,07:56.0,09:01.0,01:05.0,,,,,,
6592,16,1,T1 ,oh I think thirteen something yeah okay so pretty much the next problem,,07:56.0,08:04.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
6593,16,1,T1 ,so this is kind of like the same thing that we had before,,08:08.0,08:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6594,16,1,T1 ,so I'll start off by subtracting this,,08:15.0,08:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6595,16,1,T1 ,and then pause filler divide by this six,,08:24.0,08:33.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
6596,16,1,T1 ,and you get it four,,08:34.0,08:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6597,16,1,T1 ,okay so this is kind of like the same thing,,08:36.0,08:41.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6598,16,1,T1 ,so different pause filler adding this twenty-two so so I guess,,08:41.0,08:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6599,16,1,T1 ,pause filler sixty-two yeah equals this fifteen k four and a two fifteens,,08:47.0,08:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6600,16,1,T1 ,so yeah this is like the same thing for now,,08:54.0,08:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6601,16,1,T1 ,so to subtract this,,08:57.0,08:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6602,16,1,T1 ,,well I didn't know,08:59.0,09:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6603,16,1,T1 ,,we'll subtract it,09:00.0,09:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6604,16,1,T1 ,,,09:01.0,10:04.0,01:03.0,,,,,,
6605,16,1,T1 ,what,,09:03.0,09:03.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6606,16,1,T1 ,,no I was just doing in my head,09:04.0,09:10.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
6607,16,1,T1 ,okay so x equals pause filler equals three,,09:10.0,09:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6608,16,1,T1 ,okay so this one is just a little bit different but pretty much the same thing,,09:13.0,09:20.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6609,16,1,T1 ,so you just start off by subtracting this,,09:20.0,09:37.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
6610,16,1,T1 ,so now you have,,09:41.0,09:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6611,16,1,T1 ,so now you just kind of divide it by two,,09:43.0,09:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6612,16,1,T1 ,and you get p okay three halves,,09:46.0,09:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6613,16,1,T1 ,oh so this is like,,09:50.0,09:57.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6614,16,1,T1 ,this is like pretty much,,09:59.0,10:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6615,16,1,T1 ,pause filler just subtract this,,10:04.0,10:08.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6616,16,1,T1 ,,,10:04.0,13:13.0,03:09.0,,,,,,
6617,16,1,T1 ,so you get a negative ten equals seven k minus sixty-eight,,10:11.0,10:24.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
6618,16,1,T1 ,now you just add ten,,10:25.0,10:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6619,16,1,T1 ,oh wait add sixty-eight,,10:26.0,10:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6620,16,1,T1 ,so you get fifty-eight equals seven k,,10:32.0,10:41.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
6621,16,1,T1 ,so k is equal to eight,,10:43.0,10:52.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
6622,16,1,T1 ,okay well I guess we're left to do this,,10:56.0,11:13.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
6623,16,1,T1 ,,do you have any idea where my person,11:47.0,11:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
6624,16,1,T1 ,what's up,,11:53.0,11:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6625,16,1,T1 ,,do you have any idea where my person is out,11:56.0,11:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6626,16,1,T1 ,no clue they said just to kind of keep going while,,11:59.0,12:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6627,16,1,T1 ,there's like a couple of minutes left,,12:02.0,12:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6628,16,1,T1 ,,oh a couple of minutes left until what,12:03.0,12:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6629,16,1,T1 ,just like I guess me tutoring you,,12:06.0,12:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6630,16,1,T1 ,,oh okay,12:09.0,12:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6631,16,1,T1 ,and then like changes and then I think we're done,,12:09.0,12:17.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
6632,16,1,T1 ,so okay so shit pause filler so pause filler first you want to sit back to this,,12:17.0,12:32.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
6633,16,1,T1 ,and then pause filler come one dude strap eight just kidding never mind,,12:32.0,12:44.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
6634,16,1,T1 ,okay so we're actually going to divide this,,12:45.0,12:52.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6635,16,1,T1 ,,,13:14.0,15:37.0,02:23.0,,,,,,

6713,16,1,T1 ,oh well,,18:19.0,18:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6714,16,1,T1 ,,I thought you know that,18:19.0,18:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6715,16,1,T1 ,,oh well (laughter) (inaudible),18:54.0,18:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6716,16,1,T1 ,cool these Skittles are pause filler,,18:54.0,18:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6717,16,1,T1 ,,okay,19:32.0,19:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6718,16,1,T1 ,,all right are you ready,19:36.0,19:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6719,16,1,T1 ,,,19:39.0,21:14.0,01:35.0,,,,,,
6720,16,1,T1 ,yeah I'm ready,,19:39.0,19:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6721,16,1,T1 ,,all right so well this one here we have several,19:40.0,19:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6722,16,1,T1 ,,all you really have to do is do twenty-two oh hold on yeah twenty-two minus three,19:45.0,19:51.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
6723,16,1,T1 ,,well we're going to write this down,19:52.0,19:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6724,16,1,T1 ,yeah and there's column in this oh yeah sure,,19:55.0,20:02.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6725,16,1,T1 ,,x equals,20:02.0,20:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6726,16,1,T1 ,nineteen,,20:04.0,20:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6727,16,1,T1 ,,nineteen,20:06.0,20:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6728,16,1,T1 ,yeah,,20:07.0,20:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6729,16,1,T1 ,,and x equals,20:10.0,20:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6730,16,1,T1 ,nineteen,,20:15.0,20:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6731,16,1,T1 ,,because nineteen oh I didn't know that three was negative,20:17.0,20:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6732,16,1,T1 ,oh wait wait oh so it's twenty-five,,20:23.0,20:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6733,16,1,T1 ,,yeah,20:26.0,20:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6734,16,1,T1 ,so you just add it,,20:26.0,20:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6735,16,1,T1 ,okay hold on so just change this yeah pretty much yeah,,20:27.0,20:34.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6736,16,1,T1 ,,all right now this right here negative y plus eighteen equals twenty-three,20:37.0,20:53.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
6737,16,1,T1 ,,so hold on,20:54.0,20:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6738,16,1,T1 ,,let me do it,20:55.0,20:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6739,16,1,T1 ,just subtract the eighteen,,20:58.0,21:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6740,16,1,T1 ,,okay subtract eighteen for both sides,21:01.0,21:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6741,16,1,T1 ,,so you would,21:03.0,21:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6742,16,1,T1 ,so you get negative y equals five,,21:04.0,21:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6743,16,1,T1 ,but then you can just throw a negative one to the other side to make it y equals negative five,,21:08.0,21:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6744,16,1,T1 ,but I'm not sure,,21:12.0,21:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,SD,
6745,16,1,T1 ,,,21:14.0,23:30.0,02:16.0,,,,,,
6746,16,1,T1 ,,y equals twenty-three,21:22.0,21:31.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
6747,16,1,T1 ,yeah negative y equals,,21:31.0,21:39.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
6748,16,1,T1 ,yeah so y equals negative five okay pause filler,,21:39.0,21:47.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
6749,16,1,T1 ,,so here you would add k to both sides,21:49.0,21:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6750,16,1,T1 ,right so then we get negative fourteen equals thirty-six plus two k eighty-two k and then pause filler,,21:52.0,22:02.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
6751,16,1,T1 ,,oh hold on because I need to pause filler,22:02.0,22:17.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
6752,16,1,T1 ,oh no no,,22:17.0,22:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6753,16,1,T1 ,,see it would be negative forty equals,22:18.0,22:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6754,16,1,T1 ,thirty-six plus two k,,22:22.0,22:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6755,16,1,T1 ,,yeah,22:24.0,22:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6756,16,1,T1 ,and then pause filler,,22:26.0,22:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6757,16,1,T1 ,,so two k and then you would subtract,22:26.0,22:39.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
6758,16,1,T1 ,thirty-six,,22:39.0,22:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6759,16,1,T1 ,,from both sides,22:41.0,22:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6760,16,1,T1 ,yeah so then it becomes pause filler okay pause filler fourteen,,22:41.0,22:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6761,16,1,T1 ,okay so we got fourteen equals thirty-six is,,22:46.0,22:53.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6762,16,1,T1 ,pause filler oh it's fifty negative fifty,,22:53.0,23:00.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6763,16,1,T1 ,I guess k equals negative,,23:00.0,23:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6764,16,1,T1 ,oh two k equals negative fifty and then pause filler so,,23:03.0,23:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6765,16,1,T1 ,,divide that by a two,23:08.0,23:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6766,16,1,T1 ,yeah so k equals negative twenty-five,,23:11.0,23:40.0,00:29.0,,,,,,
6767,16,1,T1 ,,all righty,23:40.0,23:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6768,16,1,T1 ,yeah pause filler same set of things add b,,23:42.0,23:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6769,16,1,T1 ,,it would be seventeen equals,23:44.0,23:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6770,16,1,T1 ,thirteen plus two yeah,,23:48.0,23:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6771,16,1,T1 ,,two b,23:51.0,23:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6772,16,1,T1 ,yeah and then subtract thirteen to get four,,23:51.0,24:19.0,00:28.0,,,,,,
6773,16,1,T1 ,and then divide the four by two to get to b equals two,,24:19.0,24:38.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
6774,16,1,T1 ,,,24:26.0,26:10.0,01:44.0,,,,,,
6775,16,1,T1 ,yeah so that's that one,,24:38.0,24:43.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6776,16,1,T1 ,so basically just divide the pause filler the negative nine to get g equals negative,,24:43.0,24:53.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
6777,16,1,T1 ,,well you know that too negative is like a positive right,24:53.0,24:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6778,16,1,T1 ,,,24:57.0,26:09.0,01:12.0,,,,,,
6779,16,1,T1 ,yeah yeah I didn't think of that,,24:57.0,24:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6780,16,1,T1 ,,so it would just be negative nine,24:59.0,25:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6781,16,1,T1 ,yeah pretty much,,25:02.0,25:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6782,16,1,T1 ,,because nine times nine I guess like a seven (inaudible),25:03.0,25:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6783,16,1,T1 ,I don't think you have,,25:06.0,25:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6784,16,1,T1 ,who knows,,25:10.0,25:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6785,16,1,T1 ,you might not know right now but pause filler,,25:10.0,25:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6786,16,1,T1 ,,oh wow,25:14.0,25:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6787,16,1,T1 ,yeah,,25:17.0,25:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6788,16,1,T1 ,,all right so here,25:26.0,25:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6789,16,1,T1 ,subtract ten,,25:30.0,25:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6790,16,1,T1 ,,from both sides,25:31.0,25:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6791,16,1,T1 ,yeah,,25:34.0,25:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6792,16,1,T1 ,,oh we'll see,25:35.0,25:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6793,16,1,T1 ,so seven times two equals negative eight y divide,,25:38.0,25:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
6794,16,1,T1 ,,divide that by eight,25:45.0,25:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6795,16,1,T1 ,yeah so it's nine all right yeah,,25:48.0,26:06.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
6796,16,1,T1 ,,oh yeah it would be,26:06.0,26:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6797,16,1,T1 ,yeah I guess nine so,,26:12.0,26:26.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
6798,16,1,T1 ,,it would have to and sixty-five,26:26.0,26:31.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6799,16,1,T1 ,,so just pause filler I think,26:31.0,26:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6800,16,1,T1 ,so subtract,,26:32.0,26:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6801,16,1,T1 ,because that's a positive sixty-five,,26:35.0,26:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6802,16,1,T1 ,the fourteen x is negative,,26:38.0,26:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6803,16,1,T1 ,but sixty-five is positive,,26:41.0,26:52.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
6804,16,1,T1 ,so I think you have to subtract it,,26:52.0,26:57.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6805,16,1,T1 ,and then pause filler I want to get pause filler,,26:57.0,27:11.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
6806,16,1,T1 ,,then we will get the same x equals,27:11.0,27:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6807,16,1,T1 ,,I guess (inaudible),27:13.0,27:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6808,16,1,T1 ,one hundred seven minus sixty-five,,27:14.0,27:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6809,16,1,T1 ,,forty-two,27:16.0,27:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6810,16,1,T1 ,yeah,,27:19.0,27:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6811,16,1,T1 ,,and then divide this by fourteen,27:23.0,27:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6812,16,1,T1 ,fourteen twenty-eight pause filler three right yeah yeah,,27:27.0,27:40.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
6813,16,1,S2 ,,,27:37.0,32:03.0,04:26.0,,,,,,
6814,16,1,S2 ,,three,27:41.0,27:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6815,16,1,S2 ,yeah three okay pause filler I have forty-one and then yeah,,27:42.0,28:02.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
6816,16,1,S2 ,,okay,28:02.0,28:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6817,16,1,S2 ,so then we get yeah seventy-five equals,,28:09.0,28:21.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
6818,16,1,S2 ,oh it's pause filler eight and pause filler eight and a third right yeah eight and third,,28:23.0,28:32.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
6819,16,1,S2 ,,whoa whoa whoa,28:33.0,28:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6820,16,1,S2 ,because seventy-five divided by nine yeah,,28:37.0,28:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6821,16,1,S2 ,,all righty in here you have to hmm,28:43.0,28:55.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
6822,16,1,S2 ,add p start,,28:55.0,28:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6823,16,1,S2 ,,add p to both sides,28:59.0,29:05.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
6824,16,1,S2 ,yeah,,29:09.0,29:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6825,16,1,S2 ,,all right and that would mean negative fifty,29:10.0,29:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6826,16,1,S2 ,fifty-two equals nine,,29:15.0,29:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6827,16,1,S2 ,,equals,29:17.0,29:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6828,16,1,S2 ,nine p minus sixteen,,29:20.0,29:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6829,16,1,S2 ,,minus sixteen now subtract sixteen from both sides right,29:24.0,29:47.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
6830,16,1,S2 ,yeah,,29:47.0,29:47.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6831,16,1,S2 ,,oh oops oops oops sixty-two minus sixteen thirty-six,29:47.0,29:57.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
6832,16,1,S2 ,yeah and that's pause filler nine eighteen,,29:58.0,30:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6833,16,1,S2 ,and it's four,,30:01.0,30:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6834,16,1,S2 ,oh it's really thirty-six,,30:04.0,30:08.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6835,16,1,S2 ,but it doesn't look right,,30:09.0,30:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6836,16,1,S2 ,,pause filler yeah it's not a negative right yeah,30:13.0,30:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6837,16,1,S2 ,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah nine p divided by nine,,30:16.0,30:24.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
6838,16,1,S2 ,p equals four,,30:24.0,30:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6839,16,1,S2 ,,okay I think,30:29.0,30:34.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6840,16,1,S2 ,yeah that's it,,30:35.0,30:44.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
6841,16,1,S2 ,,nah all right oh and on this right here why don't we do forty-one minus fourteen,30:44.0,30:55.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
6842,16,1,S2 ,,you will subtract twenty-six w now,30:55.0,31:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
6843,16,1,S2 ,no no add fourteen yeah,,31:02.0,31:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6844,16,1,S2 ,and then you get forty w plus nineteen yeah,,31:06.0,31:17.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
6845,16,1,S2 ,,one forty one one forty one equals nineteen plus twenty-seven w right,31:20.0,31:31.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
6846,16,1,S2 ,yeah oh wait no no no no oh plus forty w because fourteen,,31:31.0,31:41.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
6847,16,1,S2 ,,oh oh yeah,31:41.0,31:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6848,16,1,S2 ,yeah,,31:42.0,31:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6849,16,1,S2 ,,forty that's a forty,31:46.0,31:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6850,16,1,S2 ,,and subtract nineteen forty w equals,31:51.0,32:08.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
6851,16,1,S2 ,pause filler,,32:08.0,32:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6852,16,1,S2 ,,one twenty-two right,32:10.0,32:21.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
6853,16,1,S2 ,yeah yeah,,32:21.0,32:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6854,16,1,S2 ,,over forty,32:22.0,32:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6855,16,1,S2 ,mm-hmm it's like thirty and two fortys so like three and a four right,,32:24.0,32:39.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
6856,16,1,S2,,,32:36.0,33:28.0,00:52.0,,,,,,
6857,16,1,S2,I think yeah something like that,,32:39.0,32:51.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
6858,16,1,S2,,okay,32:51.0,32:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6859,16,1,S2,all right oh,,32:52.0,32:52.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6860,16,1,S2,,I don't know where my person when he comes,32:52.0,33:05.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
6861,16,1,S2,yup,,33:41.0,33:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6862,16,1,S2,,what happened what happened,33:42.0,33:52.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
6863,16,1,S2,so he basically said that keep doing the same thing,,33:52.0,34:01.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
6864,16,1,S2,,oh,34:05.0,34:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6865,16,1,S2,pause filler,,34:06.0,34:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6866,16,1,S2,,okay so I'm you would subtract y,34:07.0,34:11.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6867,16,1,S2,no add y to negative,,34:14.0,34:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6868,16,1,S2,so then you get yeah yeah,,34:17.0,34:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6869,16,1,S2,because then you get pause filler two y,,34:19.0,34:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6870,16,1,S2,so negative sixty-three equals forty-three plus two y,,34:23.0,34:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
6871,16,1,S2,,oh my gosh so then you will subtract forty-three from both sides,34:28.0,34:51.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
6872,16,1,S2,yeah oh boy pause filler so this is negative,,34:51.0,34:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6873,16,1,S2,,twenty no not it twenty is negative twenty,34:53.0,35:09.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
6874,16,1,T2 ,,,35:04.0,52:39.0,17:35.0,,,,,,
6875,16,1,T2 ,,,35:07.0,36:12.0,01:05.0,,,,,,
6876,16,1,T2 ,,yeah so I think it is,35:09.0,35:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6877,16,1,T2 ,yeah yeah yeah yeah,,35:14.0,35:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6878,16,1,T2 ,,okay this will be easy division,35:18.0,35:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6879,16,1,T2 ,yeah so y is pause filler,,35:22.0,35:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6880,16,1,T2 ,,it's negative ten,35:25.0,35:37.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
6881,16,1,T2 ,yeah oh so you would just add p again,,35:37.0,35:47.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
6882,16,1,T2 ,,oh (inaudible),35:47.0,35:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6883,16,1,T2 ,okay so after you add p you subtract the forty-eight,,35:53.0,36:09.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
6884,16,1,T2 ,,,36:13.0,37:18.0,01:05.0,,,,,,
6885,16,1,T2 ,okay,,36:38.0,36:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

6983,16,2,S1 ,,we were actually pause filler,06:47.0,06:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6984,16,2,S1 ,,three over seven x equals one right there,07:24.0,07:30.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
6985,16,2,S1 ,yeah,,07:32.0,07:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6986,16,2,S1 ,,do you see three over seven x equals forty,07:33.0,07:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6987,16,2,S1 ,say that again,,07:45.0,07:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6988,16,2,S1 ,,do you see,07:47.0,07:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6989,16,2,S1 ,,three over seven x equals forty,07:48.0,07:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
6990,16,2,S1 ,pause filler yeah,,07:53.0,07:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
6991,16,2,S1 ,,okay,07:53.0,07:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6992,16,2,S1 ,yeah we just checked,,08:09.0,08:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6993,16,2,S1 ,it's like oh I can't full screen that okay,,08:11.0,08:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
6994,16,2,S1 ,all right so I'm good,,08:14.0,08:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6995,16,2,S1 ,all right,,08:17.0,08:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
6996,16,2,S1 ,okay,,08:25.0,08:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6997,16,2,S1 ,,all righty,08:26.0,08:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
6998,16,2,S1 ,do you see the problem,,08:27.0,08:35.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
6999,16,2,S1 ,,yeah do you see,08:35.0,08:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7000,16,2,S1 ,,I can make sure that (inaudible),08:36.0,08:41.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7001,16,2,S1 ,,pause filler okay yeah already we're ready,08:43.0,09:01.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
7002,16,2,S1 ,all right so I guess I'm tutoring first,,09:02.0,09:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7003,16,2,S1 ,so I guess I'll just,,09:05.0,09:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7004,16,2,S1 ,pause filler I'll just start okay so first yeah okay,,09:09.0,09:15.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7005,16,2,S1 ,first we have to multiply this by oh what,,09:15.0,09:23.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7006,16,2,S1 ,,I don't know (inaudible),09:25.0,09:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7007,16,2,S1 ,by pause filler seven thirds so that these cancel out,,09:26.0,09:34.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7008,16,2,S1 ,and this is cancelled out,,09:34.0,09:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7009,16,2,S1 ,but then we have to multiply this by damn it by seven thirds,,09:37.0,09:43.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7010,16,2,S1 ,so now oh god I have to do forty-eight times seven twenty-eight so two hundred eighty divided by three,,09:48.0,10:09.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
7011,16,2,T1 ,,,09:53.0,26:46.0,16:53.0,,,,,,
7012,16,2,T1 ,,,09:54.0,11:54.0,02:00.0,,,,,,
7013,16,2,T1 ,and that's kind of how you get the answer pretty much,,10:10.0,10:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7014,16,2,T1 ,so yeah we're wrong okay,,10:16.0,10:38.0,00:22.0,,,,,,
7015,16,2,T1 ,well my thing when we're off center,,10:38.0,10:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7016,16,2,T1 ,but I'm just going to rewrite the problem,,10:40.0,10:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7017,16,2,T1 ,,or I think that,10:43.0,10:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7018,16,2,T1 ,,this is hard,10:45.0,10:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7019,16,2,T1 ,okay let's pretend that's an x,,10:46.0,10:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7020,16,2,T1 ,because that would make (inaudible),,10:51.0,10:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7021,16,2,T1 ,so here's kind of like the same thing,,10:53.0,10:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7022,16,2,T1 ,we're just going to multiply by eight thirds thirds,,10:57.0,11:03.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7023,16,2,T1 ,and then same thing over here,,11:03.0,11:11.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7024,16,2,T1 ,hold on wait,,11:11.0,11:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7025,16,2,T1 ,I'll get it,,11:14.0,11:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7026,16,2,T1 ,okay so we have a hundred twelve thirds pretty much,,11:16.0,11:22.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7027,16,2,T1 ,so yeah that's like the same thing as the last one,,11:23.0,11:42.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
7028,16,2,T1 ,,(inaudible),11:27.0,11:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7029,16,2,T1 ,,so like that's a little bit three,11:43.0,12:01.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
7030,16,2,T1 ,,,11:54.0,12:57.0,01:03.0,,,,,,
7031,16,2,T1 ,,you know why don't you divide twelve by three,12:02.0,12:05.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7032,16,2,T1 ,yeah but pause filler on the example sheets pretty much they left it like as a fraction,,12:06.0,12:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7033,16,2,T1 ,so that's just kind of what I've decided to do,,12:13.0,12:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7034,16,2,T1 ,okay so this one is actually centered which is kind of nice,,12:18.0,12:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7035,16,2,T1 ,so first thing that I'm going to do is add eighteen,,12:21.0,12:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7036,16,2,T1 ,so we're going to get negative,,12:26.0,12:33.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7037,16,2,T1 ,so that we're kind of doing the same thing,,12:37.0,12:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7038,16,2,T1 ,negative two-thirds y equals fifty-two,,12:41.0,12:49.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7039,16,2,T1 ,so we're going to multiply by three halves,,12:49.0,12:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7040,16,2,T1 ,and then this whole thing cancels,,12:57.0,13:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7041,16,2,T1 ,,,12:57.0,15:07.0,02:10.0,,,,,,
7042,16,2,T1 ,I'm left with that,,13:01.0,13:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7043,16,2,T1 ,and then we have a y equals fifty-two,,13:04.0,13:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7044,16,2,T1 ,a hundred four a hundred and fifty-six divided by two or pause filler y equals seven,,13:09.0,13:33.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
7045,16,2,T1 ,that's four seventy-eight I think,,13:33.0,13:38.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7046,16,2,T1 ,,so (inaudible),13:38.0,13:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7047,16,2,T1 ,okay so yeah I'm just close enough,,13:40.0,13:46.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7048,16,2,T1 ,okay so we'll this year is kind of off centered too,,13:52.0,14:03.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7049,16,2,T1 ,,yeah yes (inaudible),14:03.0,14:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7050,16,2,T1 ,well this is kind of hard because,,14:04.0,14:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7051,16,2,T1 ,pause filler I don't really know what that equals,,14:09.0,14:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7052,16,2,T1 ,so maybe I can like select it,,14:13.0,14:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7053,16,2,T1 ,let me see,,14:17.0,14:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7054,16,2,T1 ,maybe I can like copy and paste it,,14:26.0,14:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7055,16,2,T1 ,we're just look through to see what I could do here no,,14:29.0,14:38.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7056,16,2,T1 ,okay I don't think I can do anything,,14:40.0,14:46.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7057,16,2,T1 ,so let's just move on and maybe like come back to this one nice,,14:47.0,15:03.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
7058,16,2,T1 ,wait oh maybe I know this okay oh,,15:03.0,15:33.0,00:30.0,,,,,,
7059,16,2,T1 ,,,15:07.0,16:11.0,01:04.0,,,,,,
7060,16,2,T1 ,okay did you get this now,,15:33.0,15:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7061,16,2,T1 ,,yeah,15:37.0,15:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7062,16,2,T1 ,okay all right so okay so first we're going to add the sixteen,,15:38.0,15:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7063,16,2,T1 ,so now we have three equals ten,,15:53.0,15:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7064,16,2,T1 ,,(inaudible),15:55.0,15:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7065,16,2,T1 ,yeah you have forty-seven equals three six x,,15:58.0,16:07.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7066,16,2,T1 ,so we're going to multiply it by six thirds now,,16:07.0,16:14.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7067,16,2,T1 ,that crosses out,,16:14.0,16:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7068,16,2,T1 ,that crosses out,,16:16.0,16:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7069,16,2,T1 ,we're just left with x,,16:18.0,16:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7070,16,2,T1 ,so we have forty-seven equals x,,16:21.0,16:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7071,16,2,T1 ,but this is multiplied by six thirds,,16:27.0,16:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7072,16,2,T1 ,so oh man so I have to multiply,,16:31.0,16:38.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7073,16,2,T1 ,do you know what forty-seven times six is,,16:38.0,16:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7074,16,2,T1 ,,multiply seven (inaudible),16:50.0,16:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7075,16,2,T1 ,all right,,16:54.0,16:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7076,16,2,T1 ,,two hundred eighty,16:57.0,17:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7077,16,2,T1 ,,,17:00.0,19:09.0,02:09.0,,,,,,
7078,16,2,T1 ,okay so can you do that,,17:02.0,17:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7079,16,2,T1 ,divide it by three,,17:07.0,17:15.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7080,16,2,T1 ,,oh first time,17:15.0,17:22.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7081,16,2,T1 ,oh man,,17:22.0,17:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7082,16,2,T1 ,,ninety-four,17:22.0,17:23.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7083,16,2,T1 ,okay so x equals ninety-four so,,17:24.0,17:29.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7084,16,2,T1 ,there we go,,17:29.0,17:35.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7085,16,2,T1 ,okay so first we're going to subtract this forty-eight oh man close enough the,,17:41.0,17:55.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
7086,16,2,T1 ,we're going to get,,17:59.0,18:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7087,16,2,T1 ,pause filler I know what this is ninety-seven minus forty fifty-seven forty-nine yeah,,18:00.0,18:08.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7088,16,2,T1 ,so forty-nine equals negative twelve fifths y,,18:09.0,18:17.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7089,16,2,T1 ,so I have to multiply it by five twelfths,,18:18.0,18:27.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7090,16,2,T1 ,and you're okay,,18:40.0,18:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7091,16,2,T1 ,so now we're going to get forty-nine times five,,18:42.0,18:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7092,16,2,T1 ,so wait so two hundred forty-five sounds right yeah two hundred forty-five divided by twelve oh,,18:46.0,19:04.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
7093,16,2,T1 ,okay so first I'm going to add this sixty-one,,19:04.0,19:24.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
7094,16,2,T1 ,,,19:09.0,20:53.0,01:44.0,,,,,,
7095,16,2,T1 ,so I have negative six sevenths y equals twenty-five plus five,,19:32.0,19:44.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7096,16,2,T1 ,so eighty-six plus this y so let me see this real quick,,19:44.0,20:12.0,00:28.0,,,,,,
7097,16,2,T1 ,pause filler okay so I guess we're going to subtract this y,,20:13.0,20:22.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7098,16,2,T1 ,so if we were to multiply this we get seven six y,,20:28.0,20:39.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7099,16,2,T1 ,so we get left with seven sixth,,20:39.0,20:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7100,16,2,T1 ,but we have to keep the y,,20:43.0,20:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7101,16,2,T1 ,because if we were to multiply we'll have another y,,20:44.0,20:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7102,16,2,T1 ,so we have this,,20:47.0,20:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7103,16,2,T1 ,y equals eighty-six and then,,20:49.0,20:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7104,16,2,T1 ,,,20:53.0,23:17.0,02:24.0,,,,,,
7105,16,2,T1 ,okay so that y is the same,,20:57.0,20:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7106,16,2,T1 ,it's eighty-six times seven oh man so yeah,,20:59.0,21:07.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7107,16,2,T1 ,six hundred and two six hundred and two divided by six it's what y equal to,,21:10.0,21:28.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
7108,16,2,T1 ,so moving onto okay so all right so first I'm going to add this eighty-three,,21:29.0,21:55.0,00:26.0,,,,,,
7109,16,2,T1 ,so now we have this,,21:55.0,21:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7110,16,2,T1 ,eleven x equals one hundred plus ten thirds ten thirds x,,21:56.0,22:11.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
7111,16,2,T1 ,so what we're going to do here is now,,22:11.0,22:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7112,16,2,T1 ,we're going to subtract this x,,22:13.0,22:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7113,16,2,T1 ,so now we're left with negative eleven equals one hundred x plus this pause filler ten thirds,,22:19.0,22:35.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
7114,16,2,T1 ,but we're going to make this into a three tenths three tenths x,,22:35.0,22:44.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7115,16,2,T1 ,and then we have,,22:44.0,22:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7116,16,2,T1 ,pause filler let me see oh wait this oh okay,,22:45.0,22:52.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7117,16,2,T1 ,so now we have to also multiply this by three times,,22:52.0,23:02.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7118,16,2,T1 ,this should not,,23:03.0,23:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7119,16,2,T1 ,so this should also be multiplied by three tenths,,23:10.0,23:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7120,16,2,T1 ,so then we get,,23:17.0,23:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7121,16,2,T1 ,,,23:18.0,25:55.0,02:37.0,,,,,,
7122,16,2,T1 ,so this would cancel and just give us oh wait not,,23:19.0,23:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7123,16,2,T1 ,I'm not doing something wrong here,,23:23.0,23:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7124,16,2,T1 ,okay so basically we're going to three three over ten equals one thousand over three x so,,23:27.0,23:40.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
7125,16,2,T1 ,okay so this is kind of well it actually it like the same thing,,23:40.0,23:59.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
7126,16,2,T1 ,so then I don't have to deal with negative,,23:59.0,24:06.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7127,16,2,T1 ,so I'm going to subtract this thirty-five,,24:07.0,24:13.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7128,16,2,T1 ,,did you see her,24:13.0,24:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7129,16,2,T1 ,she what,,24:16.0,24:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7130,16,2,T1 ,,no never mind,24:20.0,24:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7131,16,2,T1 ,okay oh it's thirty-four oh,,24:25.0,24:32.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7132,16,2,T1 ,,oh well (inaudible) how do I solve this,24:32.0,24:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7133,16,2,T1 ,pause filler to undo (inaudible) (laughter),,24:36.0,24:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7134,16,2,T1 ,,that was fun,24:39.0,24:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7135,16,2,T1 ,so subtract this thirty-four,,24:43.0,24:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7136,16,2,T1 ,okay,,24:58.0,24:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7137,16,2,T1 ,all right so pause filler yeah we're going to subtract this thirty-four,,25:05.0,25:11.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7138,16,2,T1 ,and we're going to get,,25:11.0,25:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7139,16,2,T1 ,pause filler what am I doing twenty-one right yeah,,25:17.0,25:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7140,16,2,T1 ,so you have nineteen over four y plus twenty-one equals fourteen y,,25:23.0,25:38.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
7141,16,2,T1 ,that was like really weird,,25:40.0,25:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7142,16,2,T1 ,it's like eight people just walked into this room,,25:41.0,25:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7143,16,2,T1 ,and they're like oh yeah we're looking at the carpet,,25:45.0,25:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7144,16,2,T1 ,and I was like all right,,25:48.0,25:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7145,16,2,T1 ,that was kind of weird pause filler okay,,25:50.0,25:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7146,16,2,T1 ,,oh they're weird,25:54.0,25:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7147,16,2,T1 ,,,25:55.0,29:40.0,03:45.0,,,,,,
7148,16,2,T1 ,yeah so now we're going to subtract y from each side,,25:58.0,26:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7149,16,2,T1 ,so I have nineteen fours y,,26:03.0,26:09.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7150,16,2,T1 ,plus twenty-one equals pause filler fourteen,,26:10.0,26:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7151,16,2,T1 ,oh wait that shouldn't be there,,26:18.0,26:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7152,16,2,T1 ,that should be four,,26:23.0,26:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7153,16,2,T1 ,well when we multiply this out it would be four nineteen slot,,26:28.0,26:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7154,16,2,T1 ,so then well that really didn't go very well,,26:39.0,26:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7155,16,2,T1 ,so then we're going to,,26:43.0,26:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7156,16,2,T1 ,basically I'm going to,,26:44.0,26:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7157,16,2,T1 ,you and I shouldn't do this,,26:46.0,26:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7158,16,2,T1 ,I'm going to subtract with fourteen,,26:48.0,26:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7159,16,2,T1 ,so we have four nineteenths y equals seven,,26:54.0,27:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7160,16,2,T1 ,and now basically we talked again improper fractions so or just the fraction in general so twenty-eight nineteenths y,,27:01.0,27:08.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7161,16,2,T1 ,oh so that's the answer to this one,,27:08.0,27:27.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
7162,16,2,T1 ,,,27:30.0,30:10.0,02:40.0,,,,,,
7163,16,2,T1 ,so okay so we now have a much bigger and more complicated problem then I really wanted to have but whatever,,27:33.0,27:45.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7164,16,2,T1 ,so first we're going to subtract this two hundred and two,,27:47.0,27:57.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7165,16,2,T1 ,so three three four minus two hundred is one,,27:57.0,28:03.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7166,16,2,T1 ,okay,,28:08.0,28:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7167,16,2,T1 ,okay,,28:09.0,28:09.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7168,16,2,T1 ,hi,,28:10.0,28:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7169,16,2,T1 ,okay so pause filler on the Scribbler board some things are kind of centered to like bullet point a little bit centered to the left,,28:44.0,28:53.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7170,16,2,T1 ,so I just move the screen over so that,,28:53.0,28:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7171,16,2,T1 ,okay all right I was just making sure,,28:56.0,28:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7172,16,2,T1 ,because I could really see the problem,,28:58.0,29:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7173,16,2,T1 ,so I just moved it over,,29:00.0,29:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7174,16,2,T1 ,nice,,29:25.0,29:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7175,16,2,T1 ,all right I want the purple kind,,29:39.0,29:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7176,16,2,T1 ,,,29:40.0,30:10.0,00:30.0,,,,,,
7177,16,2,T1 ,what is what's oh man,,29:45.0,29:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7178,16,2,T1 ,oh it just smells like this sour one,,29:49.0,29:59.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7179,16,2,T1 ,,the sour ones are the best,29:59.0,30:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7180,16,2,T1 ,hmm,,30:03.0,30:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7181,16,2,T1 ,,the sour ones are the best,30:04.0,30:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7182,16,2,T1 ,they're good,,30:08.0,30:08.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7183,16,2,T1 ,but like I don't know,,30:08.0,30:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7184,16,2,T1 ,this annoys me,,30:12.0,30:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7185,16,2,T1 ,what about the wild berry one,,30:13.0,30:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7186,16,2,T1 ,,(inaudible) flavor is crazy,30:17.0,30:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,

7210,16,2,S2 ,,I'm saving these for later,33:25.0,33:33.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7211,16,2,S2 ,hmm,,33:28.0,33:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7212,16,2,S2 ,not bad yeah I'm eating one more,,33:33.0,33:42.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7213,16,2,S2 ,then I'll save these,,33:43.0,33:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7214,16,2,S2 ,,negative (inaudible),33:45.0,33:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7215,16,2,S2 ,,yeah,33:56.0,33:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7216,16,2,S2 ,is there a way I can like turn the mic off,,34:02.0,34:08.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7217,16,2,S2 ,like is there a way I can turn the mic off or,,34:08.0,34:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7218,16,2,S2 ,I sometimes am having trouble hearing him but from both part,,34:10.0,34:18.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7219,16,2,S2 ,pause filler it's working,,34:18.0,34:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7220,16,2,S2 ,yeah pretty much I think I can do that just a little bit,,34:23.0,34:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7221,16,2,S2 ,okay thank you,,34:29.0,34:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7222,16,2,S2 ,okay,,34:49.0,34:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7223,16,2,S2 ,,oh you have to understand that,34:50.0,34:57.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7224,16,2,S2 ,you're there to make sure (inaudible) solving problems,,34:57.0,35:03.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7225,16,2,S2 ,all right,,35:03.0,35:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7226,16,2,S2 ,,well so here again (inaudible) all right so pause filler here we have x equals twenty-seven,35:04.0,35:14.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7227,16,2,S2 ,,so we should multiply both sides by x,35:14.0,35:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7228,16,2,S2 ,yeah seems like a good idea,,35:17.0,35:19.0,00:02.0,,,,LP,,
7229,16,2,S2 ,,and then we have one over twenty-five,35:19.0,35:25.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7230,16,2,S2 ,,and twenty-five equals (inaudible) twenty-five equals twenty-five x so (inaudible),35:25.0,35:32.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7231,16,2,S2 ,,so x equals one,35:32.0,35:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7232,16,2,S2 ,yeah,,35:38.0,35:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7233,16,2,S2 ,,oh (inaudible),35:38.0,35:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7234,16,2,S2 ,yeah it's basically,,35:39.0,35:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7235,16,2,S2 ,you got to just do it now,,35:41.0,35:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7236,16,2,S2 ,I'll eat some more Skittles,,35:47.0,35:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7237,16,2,S2 ,,wait oh sounds like (inaudible),35:49.0,36:01.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7238,16,2,S2 ,pause filler yeah I got it,,36:01.0,36:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7239,16,2,S2 ,,I got it,36:05.0,36:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7240,16,2,S2 ,all right,,36:09.0,36:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7241,16,2,S2 ,,all right and (inaudible),36:10.0,36:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7242,16,2,S2 ,right what was that in the background,,36:12.0,36:19.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7243,16,2,S2 ,,oh did you hear it,36:21.0,36:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7244,16,2,S2 ,,(inaudible),36:24.0,36:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7245,16,2,S2 ,yeah,,36:27.0,36:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7246,16,2,S2 ,oh it sounded really weird,,36:27.0,36:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7247,16,2,S2 ,and I was like what,,36:30.0,36:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7248,16,2,S2 ,,yeah we add,36:34.0,36:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7249,16,2,S2 ,yeah we add,,36:38.0,36:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7250,16,2,S2 ,,so it will be eighty,36:39.0,36:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7251,16,2,S2 ,yeah I want as well to just get a whole,,36:44.0,36:58.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
7252,16,2,S2 ,that might be good,,36:58.0,37:03.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7253,16,2,S2 ,,yay (inaudible) y is multiplied by y to both sides,37:03.0,37:09.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7254,16,2,S2 ,,which will give us negative three over eighty equals eighty-five minus five (inaudible) equals minus negative three divided by eighty (inaudible) negative two hundred times forty y (inaudible),37:09.0,37:49.0,00:40.0,,,,,,
7255,16,2,T2 ,,,37:35.0,58:05.0,20:30.0,,,,,,
7256,16,2,T2 ,,,37:47.0,38:31.0,00:44.0,,,,,,
7257,16,2,T2 ,yeah pretty much eight yeah because eighty times three is negative two forty so yeah,,37:49.0,38:02.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
7258,16,2,T2 ,,all right and then you would subtract fifty-four from both sides,38:02.0,38:09.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7259,16,2,T2 ,mm-hmm,,38:08.0,38:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7260,16,2,T2 ,,we'll let you calculate a little bit with something sixteen minus,38:09.0,38:17.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7261,16,2,T2 ,all right one sixteen sixty-two,,38:17.0,38:27.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7262,16,2,T2 ,,all right (inaudible) by k sixty-two k,38:28.0,38:46.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
7263,16,2,T2 ,,,38:32.0,41:05.0,02:33.0,,,,,,
7264,16,2,T2 ,so basically,,38:47.0,38:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7265,16,2,T2 ,,four over sixty-two four divided by sixty-two would be,38:48.0,38:59.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7266,16,2,T2 ,sixty-two divided by four,,39:01.0,39:12.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7267,16,2,T2 ,,oh (inaudible),39:12.0,39:12.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7268,16,2,T2 ,I'll say that,,39:12.0,39:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7269,16,2,T2 ,that's this way wait yeah wait,,39:14.0,39:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7270,16,2,T2 ,just leave it as an improper fraction I guess or yeah,,39:20.0,39:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7271,16,2,T2 ,because sixty-two divided by four is fifteen and a half,,39:25.0,39:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7272,16,2,T2 ,,yeah so eight equals sixteen,39:29.0,39:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7273,16,2,T2 ,yeah I guess pretty much,,39:32.0,39:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7274,16,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),39:33.0,39:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7275,16,2,T2 ,yeah wait,,39:34.0,39:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7276,16,2,T2 ,,so ten equals,39:36.0,39:43.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7277,16,2,T2 ,,oh this is easy (inaudible),39:45.0,39:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7278,16,2,T2 ,,multiply both sides by y too much since,39:46.0,39:52.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7279,16,2,T2 ,,then y equals negative forty-two equals ten negative fourteen divided by (inaudible),39:52.0,39:59.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7280,16,2,T2 ,two ten divided by fourteen,,39:59.0,40:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7281,16,2,T2 ,,yeah negative fourteen divided by negative fourteen,40:04.0,40:11.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7282,16,2,T2 ,pause filler negative fifteen,,40:13.0,40:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7283,16,2,T2 ,,okay so fifteen minus,40:18.0,40:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7284,16,2,T2 ,yeah so add this twenty-four start,,40:25.0,40:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7285,16,2,T2 ,,oh,40:29.0,40:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7286,16,2,T2 ,so then we get one thirteen,,40:36.0,40:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7287,16,2,T2 ,it's like one thirty-seven,,40:41.0,40:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7288,16,2,T2 ,does that sound right,,40:43.0,40:46.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7289,16,2,T2 ,,yeah,40:46.0,40:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7290,16,2,T2 ,pause filler okay so one thirty-seven equals five over x,,40:47.0,40:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7291,16,2,T2 ,that's weird because five,,40:51.0,40:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7292,16,2,T2 ,we're given the one thirty-seven so,,40:54.0,41:05.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7293,16,2,T2 ,,,41:05.0,42:45.0,01:40.0,,,,,,
7294,16,2,T2 ,,all righty,41:07.0,41:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7295,16,2,T2 ,yeah so mm-hmm okay pause filler well we have two negatives,,41:09.0,41:16.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7296,16,2,T2 ,so I guess we should add twenty-one to get thirty-nine pause filler to get negative eighteen,,41:36.0,42:03.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
7297,16,2,T2 ,so yeah seventeen x minus eighty-two equal twelve x,,42:12.0,42:23.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7298,16,2,T2 ,,okay and then and then x,42:29.0,42:39.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7299,16,2,T2 ,well I guess from here we have to like,,42:40.0,42:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7300,16,2,T2 ,,add seven,42:43.0,42:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7301,16,2,T2 ,no you can't add seven,,42:44.0,42:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7302,16,2,T2 ,,,42:45.0,43:36.0,00:51.0,,,,,,
7303,16,2,T2 ,because those two things have variables,,42:48.0,42:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7304,16,2,T2 ,so I guess we should subtract x,,42:50.0,42:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7305,16,2,T2 ,,or add seventeen so,42:55.0,42:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7306,16,2,T2 ,oh yeah,,42:58.0,42:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7307,16,2,T2 ,,twenty-nine x which is twenty-nine x equals two,42:59.0,43:12.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
7308,16,2,T2 ,yeah oh gosh which would be nineteen x,,43:13.0,43:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7309,16,2,T2 ,or my god I'm trying,,43:19.0,43:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7310,16,2,T2 ,I don't understand,,43:22.0,43:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7311,16,2,T2 ,,yeah oh yeah,43:25.0,43:25.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7312,16,2,T2 ,okay so,,43:27.0,43:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7313,16,2,T2 ,,add eleven,43:28.0,43:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7314,16,2,T2 ,,I mean subtract eleven,43:29.0,43:36.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7315,16,2,T2 ,,,43:36.0,44:57.0,01:21.0,,,,,,
7316,16,2,T2 ,actually before you do that pause filler it might be easier to add the ninety-two,,43:36.0,43:45.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7317,16,2,T2 ,so that we don't have to deal with a negative number,,43:45.0,43:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7318,16,2,T2 ,,all right (inaudible) well all right well all right ninety-two x plus ninety-two equals (inaudible),43:56.0,44:18.0,00:22.0,,,,,,
7319,16,2,T2 ,,well it was ninety-two and ninety-three,44:18.0,44:30.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7320,16,2,T2 ,oh yeah so basically we have three x equals a hundred three plus twelve x,,44:30.0,44:38.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7321,16,2,T2 ,so basically what we should do here is subtract the x from each side,,44:39.0,44:57.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
7322,16,2,T2 ,so that we just get three equals a hundred and,,44:57.0,45:03.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7323,16,2,T2 ,,,44:57.0,47:08.0,02:11.0,,,,,,
7324,16,2,T2 ,,got it (inaudible),45:05.0,45:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7325,16,2,T2 ,hmm,,45:06.0,45:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7326,16,2,T2 ,,you just try x equals seven,45:07.0,45:15.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7327,16,2,T2 ,yeah,,45:15.0,45:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7328,16,2,T2 ,,and we get twelve x equals eleven twelve x plus a hundred and thirty,45:16.0,45:31.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
7329,16,2,T2 ,mm-hmm,,45:21.0,45:29.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7330,16,2,T2 ,,(inaudible) this would be one actually (inaudible),45:31.0,45:43.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7331,16,2,T2 ,yeah that's it,,45:44.0,45:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7332,16,2,T2 ,,so we subtract sixty to both sides,45:51.0,45:57.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7333,16,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),45:57.0,45:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7334,16,2,T2 ,hmm,,45:59.0,46:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7335,16,2,T2 ,mm-hmm you can do that,,46:15.0,46:21.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7336,16,2,T2 ,or I would actually subtract,,46:21.0,46:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7337,16,2,T2 ,pause filler I want to really subtract twenty-five just because,,46:26.0,46:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7338,16,2,T2 ,so we won't have negative,,46:29.0,46:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7339,16,2,T2 ,but it doesn't really matter because,,46:30.0,46:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7340,16,2,T2 ,,oh yeah,46:33.0,46:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7341,16,2,T2 ,all right because negatives are like,,46:34.0,46:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7342,16,2,T2 ,they're really annoying but like,,46:37.0,46:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7343,16,2,T2 ,it's not the worst thing oh well,,46:47.0,46:55.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7344,16,2,T2 ,so basically subtract (inaudible),,46:59.0,47:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7345,16,2,T2 ,pause filler so again it was one yeah so one x plus thirty-five right,,47:02.0,47:29.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
7346,16,2,T2 ,,,47:08.0,49:51.0,02:43.0,,,,,,
7347,16,2,T2 ,,yeah,47:29.0,47:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7348,16,2,T2 ,yeah one x plus thirty-five equals nine over x or basically x plus six plus,,47:30.0,47:40.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7349,16,2,T2 ,pause filler thirty-five yeah equals nine over x,,47:40.0,47:47.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7350,16,2,T2 ,so I just subtract x from both sides,,47:48.0,47:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7351,16,2,T2 ,and then you get,,47:51.0,47:55.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7352,16,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm,47:54.0,47:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7353,16,2,T2 ,I think that makes no sense to subtract these Xs,,47:55.0,48:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7354,16,2,T2 ,,(inaudible) or four,48:01.0,48:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7355,16,2,T2 ,yeah yeah pretty much you can do that,,48:03.0,48:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7356,16,2,T2 ,,or I should say ten x plus thirty-five would equal forty-five,48:08.0,48:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7357,16,2,T2 ,,x equals twenty-five,48:12.0,48:18.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7358,16,2,T2 ,,I guess you could say that (inaudible) oh,48:18.0,48:28.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7359,16,2,T2 ,oh yeah I need more Skittles,,48:28.0,48:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7360,16,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),48:32.0,48:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7361,16,2,T2 ,,add twenty-five plus twenty-two,48:33.0,48:49.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
7362,16,2,T2 ,pause filler,,48:40.0,48:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7363,16,2,T2 ,yeah,,48:50.0,48:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7364,16,2,T2 ,,so I got to do this,48:51.0,48:58.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7365,16,2,T2 ,so yeah one o three plus ten over x equals nine over x,,48:59.0,49:11.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7366,16,2,T2 ,,oh well,49:16.0,49:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7367,16,2,T2 ,what happened,,49:19.0,49:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7368,16,2,T2 ,,well that was (inaudible) right there,49:21.0,49:28.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7369,16,2,T2 ,yeah,,49:28.0,49:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7370,16,2,T2 ,,oh my gosh,49:29.0,49:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7371,16,2,T2 ,,I'll leave one eighty and seventeen x equals seventeen x plus a hundred and three,49:34.0,50:09.0,00:35.0,,,,,,
7372,16,2,T2 ,(laughter),,49:34.0,49:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7373,16,2,T2 ,,,49:51.0,52:28.0,02:37.0,,,,,,
7374,16,2,T2 ,,a hundred and eighteen x equals nineteen,50:09.0,50:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,

7377,16,2,T2 ,wait oh wait no because sixteen one o three equals seven x,,50:19.0,50:30.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7378,16,2,T2 ,than yeah I don't know where I was going,,50:33.0,50:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7379,16,2,T2 ,never mind that seems more correct,,50:37.0,50:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7380,16,2,T2 ,,yeah (inaudible) here,50:43.0,50:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7381,16,2,T2 ,yeah kind of one forty-one,,50:47.0,50:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7382,16,2,T2 ,,what if,50:52.0,50:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7383,16,2,T2 ,that no like right now it's or one forty-one so eleven forty-one right now,,50:54.0,50:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7384,16,2,T2 ,,that was what I was talking about,50:58.0,51:08.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7385,16,2,T2 ,oh oh man,,51:09.0,51:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7386,16,2,T2 ,,all right yeah,51:10.0,51:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7387,16,2,T2 ,oh okay so actually I got to add one ninety,,51:12.0,51:34.0,00:22.0,,,,,,
7388,16,2,T2 ,so pause filler we got three forty three forty plus six x oh,,51:42.0,52:10.0,00:28.0,,,,,,
7389,16,2,T2 ,okay now add that five x over,,52:10.0,52:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7390,16,2,T2 ,so you got three forty equals eleven x,,52:13.0,52:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7391,16,2,T2 ,I'm pretty sure you can just leave it like that,,52:18.0,52:26.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7392,16,2,T2 ,,(inaudible) three forty equals eleven x (inaudible),52:26.0,52:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7393,16,2,T2 ,we'll just like tell here,,52:30.0,52:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,

7423,17,1,S1 ,okay,,02:00.0,02:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7424,17,1,S1 ,,have you ever done this before,02:00.0,02:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7425,17,1,S1 ,nope I have never done this before,,02:05.0,02:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7426,17,1,S1 ,so did you,,02:09.0,02:19.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7427,17,1,S1 ,your sound is a bit fuzzy,,02:24.0,02:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7428,17,1,S1 ,are you hearing me clearly,,02:27.0,02:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7429,17,1,S1 ,(laughter) pause filler,,02:28.0,02:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7430,17,1,S1 ,,yeah,02:30.0,02:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7431,17,1,S1 ,okay,,02:30.0,02:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7432,17,1,S1 ,,are you good at math,02:32.0,02:38.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7433,17,1,S1 ,average,,02:40.0,02:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7434,17,1,S1 ,,same,02:41.0,02:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7435,17,1,S1 ,so what grade are you in,,02:41.0,02:57.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
7436,17,1,S1 ,,I'm ninth,02:57.0,02:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7437,17,1,S1 ,same,,02:57.0,02:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7438,17,1,S1 ,,what school are you going to,02:57.0,03:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7439,17,1,S1 ,pause filler I'm going to Upper St Clair,,03:00.0,03:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7440,17,1,S1 ,,I wonder when we're going to start,03:05.0,03:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7441,17,1,S1 ,I don't know,,03:07.0,03:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7442,17,1,S1 ,x minus six equals thirteen,,06:07.0,06:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7443,17,1,S1 ,okay so in this problem how to solve it basically you want to get x,,07:33.0,07:41.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7444,17,1,S1 ,you want to have x only on one side and all the content,,07:41.0,07:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7445,17,1,S1 ,so basically (inaudible) we got a variable attach them or x on the other side,,07:46.0,07:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7446,17,1,S1 ,so you want to get this negative six here,,07:50.0,07:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7447,17,1,S1 ,you want to get it over to this side,,07:53.0,07:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7448,17,1,T1 ,,,07:56.0,28:19.0,20:23.0,,,,,,
7449,17,1,T1 ,and so this and negative is,,07:56.0,07:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7450,17,1,T1 ,,,07:56.0,09:14.0,01:18.0,,,,,,
7451,17,1,T1 ,what do we want to do,,07:57.0,08:01.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7452,17,1,T1 ,,what I want to do,08:01.0,08:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7453,17,1,T1 ,pause filler yeah you're solving the problems,,08:03.0,08:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7454,17,1,T1 ,and I'm supposed to be helping you,,08:05.0,08:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7455,17,1,T1 ,,yeah pause filler add six,08:07.0,08:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7456,17,1,T1 ,yeah so you want to add six,,08:09.0,08:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7457,17,1,T1 ,right so you know what that is or something on the other side,,08:10.0,08:22.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7458,17,1,T1 ,so when you add six to the other side what do you get,,08:22.0,08:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7459,17,1,T1 ,,pause filler nineteen,08:28.0,08:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7460,17,1,T1 ,yeah so you could get nineteen so if you have x minus six here,,08:30.0,08:36.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7461,17,1,T1 ,add six yeah x minus six in here,,08:36.0,08:38.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7462,17,1,T1 ,also add six to thirteen x equals nineteen correct so next problem,,08:38.0,08:49.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7463,17,1,T1 ,okay do you want to go to page two,,08:51.0,08:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7464,17,1,T1 ,,pause filler I'm here,08:54.0,08:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7465,17,1,T1 ,,fifteen equals negative eight plus eight,08:56.0,08:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7466,17,1,T1 ,yeah so in this problem is like the last problem,,08:59.0,09:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7467,17,1,T1 ,we have a negative number a variable and a variable on the other side and an equal sign,,09:03.0,09:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7468,17,1,T1 ,so you want to get the negative eight over to fifteen,,09:08.0,09:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7469,17,1,T1 ,so since it's a negative what do you want me to do,,09:12.0,09:23.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7470,17,1,T1 ,,,09:14.0,10:20.0,01:06.0,,,,,,
7471,17,1,T1 ,,add eight,09:23.0,09:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7472,17,1,T1 ,,probably on the other side would equal twenty-three,09:24.0,09:33.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7473,17,1,T1 ,twenty-three yeah so three equals twenty-three,,09:33.0,09:38.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7474,17,1,T1 ,,yeah so twenty-three equals eight okay okay,09:38.0,09:53.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
7475,17,1,T1 ,okay so the next problem we have seventeen equals k plus eleven right and same as the last two problems,,09:53.0,10:01.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7476,17,1,T1 ,we want to get that eleven over to the seventeen,,10:01.0,10:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7477,17,1,T1 ,but this time it's a positive,,10:03.0,10:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7478,17,1,T1 ,so instead of adding what do you want to do,,10:05.0,10:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7479,17,1,T1 ,,subtract no equals oh sixty-six,10:08.0,10:17.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7480,17,1,T1 ,sixty-six right,,10:17.0,10:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7481,17,1,T1 ,,equals two,10:19.0,10:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7482,17,1,T1 ,,,10:20.0,10:59.0,00:39.0,,,,,,
7483,17,1,T1 ,mm-hmm okay so on problem four we have forty-four x equals two-hundred twenty,,10:29.0,10:35.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7484,17,1,T1 ,so this problem is different,,10:35.0,10:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7485,17,1,T1 ,because it doesn't need (inaudible) subtracted in,,10:37.0,10:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7486,17,1,T1 ,since we have forty-four times x equals two hundred twenty,,10:39.0,10:43.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7487,17,1,T1 ,we're going to be using either multiplication or division,,10:43.0,10:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7488,17,1,T1 ,since this is twenty-four times since this is multiplication,,10:47.0,10:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7489,17,1,T1 ,you get the forty-four over eight x solitary,,10:52.0,10:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7490,17,1,T1 ,do you want to use multiplication or division,,10:55.0,10:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7491,17,1,T1 ,,division,10:58.0,10:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7492,17,1,T1 ,okay so divide forty-four from both sides,,10:59.0,11:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7493,17,1,T1 ,,,10:59.0,13:48.0,02:49.0,,,,,,
7494,17,1,T1 ,,well I don't know,11:04.0,11:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7495,17,1,T1 ,okay so if you think about forty-four,,11:06.0,11:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7496,17,1,T1 ,what is forty-four times ten,,11:09.0,11:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7497,17,1,T1 ,,four hundred forty,11:12.0,11:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7498,17,1,T1 ,and what do you think notice about four forty compared to two twenty,,11:15.0,11:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7499,17,1,T1 ,okay yes so knowing that ten times four forty is double two twenty,,11:21.0,11:32.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7500,17,1,T1 ,,(inaudible),11:23.0,11:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7501,17,1,T1 ,yeah,,11:34.0,11:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7502,17,1,T1 ,,x equals (inaudible) I'd have to figure out,11:35.0,11:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7503,17,1,T1 ,,(inaudible),11:35.0,11:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7504,17,1,T1 ,,pause filler so you could just (inaudible),11:41.0,11:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7505,17,1,T1 ,okay,,11:46.0,11:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7506,17,1,T1 ,,and it's like (inaudible) yeah,11:46.0,11:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7507,17,1,T1 ,wait x make I might have done that wrong or pause filler wait two twenty over four forty,,11:54.0,12:05.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7508,17,1,T1 ,I'd say never mind if I think I did that wrong,,12:05.0,12:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7509,17,1,T1 ,okay so two twenty over four forty is subtraction right,,12:11.0,12:17.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7510,17,1,T1 ,okay pause filler you can keep two twenty over four forty,,12:17.0,12:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7511,17,1,T1 ,,oh I can,12:21.0,12:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7512,17,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm,12:21.0,12:29.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7513,17,1,T1 ,okay so this is a fraction,,12:24.0,12:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7514,17,1,T1 ,do you know about simplifying fractions,,12:27.0,12:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7515,17,1,T1 ,,pause filler yeah,12:29.0,12:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7516,17,1,T1 ,pause filler so basically simplifying is basically dividing,,12:32.0,12:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7517,17,1,T1 ,this is partly just that common numerator,,12:37.0,12:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7518,17,1,T1 ,and this probably is called the denominator by the same number,,12:40.0,12:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7519,17,1,T1 ,so we know already that four forty is divisible by two twenty,,12:45.0,12:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7520,17,1,T1 ,so we do by both sides by two twenty,,12:48.0,12:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7521,17,1,T1 ,that would be called simplifying fraction,,12:51.0,12:53.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7522,17,1,T1 ,,one number (inaudible) just two,12:53.0,12:54.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7523,17,1,T1 ,so one over two so one over two right,,12:55.0,13:02.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7524,17,1,T1 ,,oh yeah just one over two,13:02.0,13:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7525,17,1,T1 ,yeah that was my mistake,,13:05.0,13:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7526,17,1,T1 ,,that was mine,13:09.0,13:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7527,17,1,T1 ,okay next problem we have negative nine plus thirteen p,,13:10.0,13:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7528,17,1,T1 ,so this is going to be a two-set problem,,13:14.0,13:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7529,17,1,T1 ,so here like all the other problems we have a negative nine here,,13:16.0,13:21.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7530,17,1,T1 ,and so we want to get this negative nine over to the constant side here or at this side,,13:22.0,13:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7531,17,1,T1 ,so since it's negative what do you want to do,,13:27.0,13:35.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7532,17,1,T1 ,,I'm going to add nine (inaudible),13:36.0,13:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7533,17,1,T1 ,pause filler yeah,,13:40.0,13:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7534,17,1,T1 ,,and wait what number was that,13:41.0,13:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7535,17,1,T1 ,,I'm done in here forty-one,13:47.0,13:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7536,17,1,T1 ,,,13:48.0,16:17.0,02:29.0,,,,,,
7537,17,1,T1 ,wait pause filler is there an eraser,,13:50.0,13:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7538,17,1,T1 ,,yeah that's an eraser,13:52.0,13:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7539,17,1,T1 ,okay I think that's forty-one,,13:53.0,13:59.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7540,17,1,T1 ,,oh let's not do that,13:59.0,14:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7541,17,1,T1 ,yeah,,14:02.0,14:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7542,17,1,T1 ,,okay well I'm just saying,14:03.0,14:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7543,17,1,T1 ,,it's forty-one so,14:08.0,14:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7544,17,1,T1 ,yeah okay so this is forty-one,,14:10.0,14:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7545,17,1,T1 ,,so it would be,14:13.0,14:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7546,17,1,T1 ,forty-one plus nine,,14:16.0,14:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7547,17,1,T1 ,,yeah well just fifty,14:18.0,14:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7548,17,1,T1 ,okay,,14:21.0,14:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7549,17,1,T1 ,,okay so thirteen p,14:22.0,14:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7550,17,1,T1 ,okay this one is a good number,,14:26.0,14:32.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7551,17,1,T1 ,this is forty-one,,14:32.0,14:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7552,17,1,T1 ,,fifty divide each side by thirteen,14:36.0,14:46.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7553,17,1,T1 ,yeah,,14:46.0,14:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7554,17,1,T1 ,,and what pause filler simplify again,14:54.0,14:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7555,17,1,T1 ,okay so I think in this problem,,14:58.0,15:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7556,17,1,T1 ,it is because the denominator is a prime number,,15:01.0,15:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7557,17,1,T1 ,and prime numbers are numbers that can only be divisible by one and itself,,15:03.0,15:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7558,17,1,T1 ,so we can actually simplify this anymore,,15:08.0,15:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7559,17,1,T1 ,just because thirteen isn't divided by anything,,15:10.0,15:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7560,17,1,T1 ,and we know that fifty cannot be divided by thirteen,,15:13.0,15:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7561,17,1,T1 ,so the answer would still just be fifty over thirteen,,15:17.0,15:28.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7562,17,1,T1 ,,okay pause filler,15:28.0,15:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7563,17,1,T1 ,okay we have six x plus ten equals thirty-four and same as all the other problems,,15:31.0,15:39.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7564,17,1,T1 ,so we want to get this ten over to the thirty-four side,,15:39.0,15:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7565,17,1,T1 ,so yeah we're going to subtract ten for both sides,,15:42.0,15:53.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7566,17,1,T1 ,,six x equals thirty-four,15:53.0,16:00.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7567,17,1,T1 ,yes,,16:00.0,16:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7568,17,1,T1 ,,so that would be four,16:01.0,16:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7569,17,1,T1 ,yeah x equals four,,16:03.0,16:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7570,17,1,T1 ,,okay,16:14.0,16:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7571,17,1,T1 ,,,16:17.0,17:04.0,00:47.0,,,,,,
7572,17,1,T1 ,okay the next problem we have forty equals negative twenty-two plus fifteen k,,16:17.0,16:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7573,17,1,T1 ,so we're going to get that negative twenty-two over forty side,,16:22.0,16:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7574,17,1,T1 ,so yeah add twenty-two to both sides,,16:26.0,16:36.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7575,17,1,T1 ,,pause filler this is sort of (inaudible) so sixty-two,16:36.0,16:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7576,17,1,T1 ,equals fifteen k,,16:44.0,16:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7577,17,1,T1 ,,yeah and pause filler and what pause filler divide each side by fifteen,16:47.0,16:57.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7578,17,1,T1 ,yeah,,16:57.0,16:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7579,17,1,T1 ,,x I don't know if x equals on this one,16:58.0,17:04.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7580,17,1,T1 ,so you have sixty-two divided by fifteen right,,17:04.0,17:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7581,17,1,T1 ,,,17:05.0,18:42.0,01:37.0,,,,,,
7582,17,1,T1 ,and so first you want to check if there are any common pause filler,,17:09.0,17:15.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7583,17,1,T1 ,if there are any number that you can divide both sixty-two and fifteen by pause filler which so fifteen,,17:15.0,17:22.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7584,17,1,T1 ,you have one and fifteen and three and five as its factors,,17:22.0,17:26.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7585,17,1,T1 ,and none of them match sixty-two's factors,,17:27.0,17:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7586,17,1,T1 ,,denominators,17:29.0,17:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7587,17,1,T1 ,so this fraction actually can be simplified,,17:30.0,17:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7588,17,1,T1 ,so we just have k equals sixty-two over fifteen,,17:33.0,17:40.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7589,17,1,T1 ,,all right so two pause filler,17:42.0,17:43.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7590,17,1,T1 ,okay so here we have thirty-three,,17:44.0,17:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7591,17,1,T1 ,you go twelve plus seven x right and so same as always,,17:48.0,17:57.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7592,17,1,T1 ,you want to get this constant over to the thirty-three side,,17:57.0,18:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7593,17,1,T1 ,so yeah what you're doing is correct,,18:02.0,18:09.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7594,17,1,T1 ,,so it would be seven equals twenty-one,18:09.0,18:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7595,17,1,T1 ,yeah,,18:14.0,18:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7596,17,1,T1 ,,equals twenty-one,18:16.0,18:20.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7597,17,1,T1 ,yeah,,18:20.0,18:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7598,17,1,T1 ,,and add just fifteen,18:20.0,18:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7599,17,1,T1 ,yeah correct okay so this next problem we have variables on both sides,,18:22.0,18:39.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
7600,17,1,T1 ,so basically we want to get variables on one side only,,18:40.0,18:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7601,17,1,T1 ,,,18:42.0,19:29.0,00:47.0,,,,,,
7602,17,1,T1 ,so we want to turn this p,,18:43.0,18:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7603,17,1,T1 ,and we want to get it over here and so same as numbers variables,,18:45.0,18:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7604,17,1,T1 ,you can also add,,18:50.0,18:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7605,17,1,T1 ,subtract it,,18:51.0,18:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7606,17,1,T1 ,divide them,,18:52.0,18:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7607,17,1,T1 ,so if you want to get this positive p over to here,,18:54.0,18:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7608,17,1,T1 ,yeah you would subtract p to both sides,,18:58.0,19:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7609,17,1,T1 ,,and that would be fifteen equals fifty plus twelve,19:00.0,19:22.0,00:22.0,,,,,,
7610,17,1,T1 ,yes correct and then so from here you want to get twelve to the fifteen side if this is positive,,19:22.0,19:34.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7611,17,1,T1 ,,,19:29.0,21:23.0,01:54.0,,,,,,
7612,17,1,T1 ,,this is very hard to solve,19:36.0,19:41.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7613,17,1,T1 ,so three equals two p,,19:44.0,19:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7614,17,1,T1 ,,yup,19:49.0,19:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7615,17,1,T1 ,and just divide it by two each,,19:52.0,19:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7616,17,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm,19:52.0,19:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7617,17,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm and so it would be like,19:56.0,20:03.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7618,17,1,T1 ,,I don't know,20:03.0,20:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7619,17,1,T1 ,three over two,,20:05.0,20:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7620,17,1,T1 ,,yeah I was going to say,20:06.0,20:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7621,17,1,T1 ,,like one and a half would be better pretty much,20:07.0,20:11.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7622,17,1,T1 ,yeah p over two is one and a half so,,20:11.0,20:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7623,17,1,T1 ,,yeah so it doesn't matter,20:13.0,20:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7624,17,1,T1 ,p equals one point five or three over two,,20:14.0,20:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7625,17,1,T1 ,it doesn't really matter what you put,,20:16.0,20:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7626,17,1,T1 ,,yeah next one,20:19.0,20:25.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7627,17,1,T1 ,okay you have k minus ten equals eight k minus sixty-eight,,20:25.0,20:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7628,17,1,T1 ,and so the first step you want to move k over to the eight k,,20:30.0,20:36.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7629,17,1,T1 ,so since this k is positive,,20:36.0,20:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7630,17,1,T1 ,yeah you would want to subtract,,20:41.0,20:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7631,17,1,T1 ,,negative ten equals seven k,20:44.0,20:54.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7632,17,1,T1 ,okay and so and all you go,,20:54.0,20:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7633,17,1,T1 ,you want to isolate the variables,,20:59.0,21:12.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
7634,17,1,T1 ,so you want to take this negative sixty-eight,,21:12.0,21:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7635,17,1,T1 ,and move it over here out of the variable side,,21:17.0,21:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7636,17,1,T1 ,so you would want to add sixty-eight,,21:22.0,21:31.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7637,17,1,T1 ,,,21:23.0,23:24.0,02:01.0,,,,,,
7638,17,1,T1 ,,so then I'll turn to pause filler positive pause filler fifty-eight,21:31.0,21:36.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7639,17,1,T1 ,yeah,,21:36.0,21:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7640,17,1,T1 ,,so fifty-eight equals seven k,21:37.0,21:45.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7641,17,1,T1 ,,which means k equals eight,21:50.0,21:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7642,17,1,T1 ,,or now k is just fifty-seven,21:52.0,21:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7643,17,1,T1 ,k equals fifty-eight over seven,,21:58.0,22:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7644,17,1,T1 ,,yes,22:00.0,22:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7645,17,1,T1 ,because seven times eight is actually fifty-six not fifty-two,,22:01.0,22:16.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
7646,17,1,T1 ,,yeah absolutely,22:16.0,22:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7647,17,1,T1 ,oh okay (laughter),,22:20.0,22:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7648,17,1,T1 ,,pause filler I'll just go get him,22:21.0,22:33.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7649,17,1,T1 ,okay yeah,,22:35.0,22:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7650,17,1,T1 ,,they said just keep going on,22:39.0,22:58.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
7651,17,1,T1 ,okay,,22:58.0,22:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7652,17,1,T1 ,okay uh-huh,,23:07.0,23:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7653,17,1,T1 ,so twelve is intentionally blank,,23:08.0,23:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7654,17,1,T1 ,and thirteen is our next problem,,23:10.0,23:19.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7655,17,1,T1 ,,all right,23:19.0,23:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7656,17,1,T1 ,okay so we have r minus fifty-three equals two r minus fifteen right,,23:20.0,23:34.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
7657,17,1,T1 ,so as always we want to get this r over to here,,23:34.0,23:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7658,17,1,T1 ,,so negative fifty-three oh,23:46.0,23:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7659,17,1,T1 ,okay so yeah you want to get this negative fifteen over to the negative thirty-three,,23:48.0,24:12.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
7660,17,1,T1 ,so yeah you want to add fifteen and if you have a negative number,,24:12.0,24:20.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7661,17,1,T1 ,and you want to add a positive number to that,,24:20.0,24:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7662,17,1,T1 ,you can think of it as,,24:25.0,24:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7663,17,1,T1 ,we have the negative number,,24:28.0,24:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7664,17,1,T1 ,and then you have this number minus this number,,24:30.0,24:36.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7665,17,1,T1 ,,,24:34.0,26:45.0,02:11.0,,,,,,
7666,17,1,T1 ,,so this number minus this number,24:37.0,24:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7667,17,1,T1 ,okay so to say this is,,24:41.0,24:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7668,17,1,T1 ,we have negative x,,24:42.0,24:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7669,17,1,T1 ,and then you're adding a positive y to it,,24:44.0,24:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7670,17,1,T1 ,you can think of it as negative and an x minus y as long as y is less than x,,24:47.0,24:55.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7671,17,1,T1 ,so in this case thirty-three would be x,,24:55.0,24:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7672,17,1,T1 ,and y would be fifteen right since we're adding fifteen to negative thirty-three,,24:58.0,25:04.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7673,17,1,T1 ,,[so] it would be eighteen plus eighteen sixty-eight,25:04.0,25:10.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7674,17,1,T1 ,yeah so it would be x minus five would equal to eighteen to,,25:10.0,25:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7675,17,1,T1 ,it would be negative eighteen,,25:14.0,25:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7676,17,1,T1 ,,yeah negative eighteen equals r,25:17.0,25:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7677,17,1,T1 ,,so that means just r equals negative eighteen,25:24.0,25:30.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7678,17,1,T1 ,yeah okay problem fourteen we have negative forty-two plus u equals eight plus four u,,25:30.0,25:37.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7679,17,1,T1 ,and we still have a u here,,25:37.0,25:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7680,17,1,T1 ,so we want to move this u over to four u,,25:40.0,25:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7681,17,1,T1 ,and this u is still positive,,25:43.0,25:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7682,17,1,T1 ,so we can still subtract u on both sides,,25:46.0,25:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7683,17,1,T1 ,,ah negative forty-two,25:51.0,26:11.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
7684,17,1,T1 ,and since we have this positive eight,,26:13.0,26:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7685,17,1,T1 ,we can still move it over to negative forty-two,,26:15.0,26:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7686,17,1,T1 ,,okay so,26:19.0,26:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7687,17,1,T1 ,so positive eight if you want to move it opposite to equal sign,,26:20.0,26:24.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7688,17,1,T1 ,you want to do the opposite,,26:24.0,26:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7689,17,1,T1 ,so you want to subtract,,26:27.0,26:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7690,17,1,T1 ,,so it would be negative fifty,26:31.0,26:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7691,17,1,T1 ,yeah,,26:34.0,26:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7692,17,1,T1 ,,equals,26:35.0,26:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7693,17,1,T1 ,equals negative three they really don't (inaudible) numbers here,,26:36.0,26:48.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7694,17,1,T1 ,,,26:45.0,28:18.0,01:33.0,,,,,,
7695,17,1,T1 ,okay and since this is multiplication between a three and a u,,26:48.0,26:52.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7696,17,1,T1 ,to get the three over to this side to get the three over to this side,,26:53.0,27:01.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7697,17,1,T1 ,what do you want to do,,27:01.0,27:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7698,17,1,T1 ,,just divide or divide,27:05.0,27:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7699,17,1,T1 ,yeah,,27:09.0,27:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7700,17,1,T1 ,,so fifty,27:10.0,27:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7701,17,1,T1 ,okay,,27:15.0,27:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7702,17,1,T1 ,,mm-hmm,27:20.0,27:29.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7703,17,1,S2 ,,,29:06.0,34:30.0,05:24.0,,,,,,
7704,17,1,S2 ,they do say (inaudible) how you're graded,,29:52.0,29:59.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7705,17,1,S2 ,so yeah I got Skittles (laughter),,30:00.0,30:06.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7706,17,1,S2 ,,this one might be easy twenty,30:19.0,31:20.0,01:01.0,,,,,,
7707,17,1,S2 ,I got sour Skittles,,31:21.0,31:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7708,17,1,S2 ,,(laughter) I got,31:25.0,31:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7709,17,1,S2 ,a wild berry currently I'm in a place that says the evil secret lad,,31:26.0,31:42.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
7710,17,1,S2 ,and it says do not enter of the inside of the door,,31:43.0,31:51.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7711,17,1,S2 ,but there's like a lounge that is to me so close and a giant widescreen TV,,31:57.0,32:06.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7712,17,1,S2 ,so it's a great room,,32:06.0,32:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7713,17,1,S2 ,,(inaudible) to me yeah it has a big whiteboard,32:11.0,32:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7714,17,1,S2 ,,it's all behind,32:14.0,32:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7715,17,1,S2 ,well (inaudible),,32:15.0,32:15.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7716,17,1,S2 ,,(inaudible),32:45.0,32:51.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7717,17,1,S2 ,ten minutes,,33:21.0,33:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7718,17,1,S2 ,okay,,33:23.0,33:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7719,17,1,S2 ,pause filler do I get my pen or,,33:34.0,33:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7720,17,1,S2 ,,okay,33:57.0,33:57.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7721,17,1,S2 ,so yeah,,33:57.0,33:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7722,17,1,S2 ,,yeah I know something,33:59.0,34:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7723,17,1,S2 ,,yeah that's pretty easy,34:01.0,34:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7724,17,1,S2 ,I can actually use the pen,,34:03.0,34:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7725,17,1,S2 ,,pause filler so I've used that before (inaudible),34:05.0,34:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7726,17,1,S2 ,yeah same concept like I said,,34:07.0,34:11.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7727,17,1,S2 ,,pixelated yeah I think I'm just going to be repeating what you said,34:11.0,34:21.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7728,17,1,S2 ,,and it's pretty much (inaudible) and pause filler (inaudible) is you have to (inaudible) concept,34:22.0,34:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7729,17,1,S2 ,,and you just leave it as a fraction,34:27.0,34:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7730,17,1,S2 ,yeah,,34:29.0,34:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7731,17,1,S2 ,,that's all there really is,34:30.0,34:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7732,17,1,S2 ,,this is easy,34:34.0,34:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7733,17,1,S2 ,,pause filler you add k so,34:38.0,34:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7734,17,1,S2 ,and then we add on this side negative fourteen minus thirty-six,,34:43.0,34:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7735,17,1,S2 ,and so twenty fifty negative fifty equals two k,,34:49.0,34:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7736,17,1,S2 ,,mm-hmm,34:53.0,34:55.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7737,17,1,S2 ,and so divide that by two,,34:55.0,34:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7738,17,1,S2 ,we have negative twenty-five equals k,,34:57.0,35:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7739,17,1,S2 ,and so here we can just add b to both sides,,35:01.0,35:08.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7740,17,1,S2 ,,(inaudible) yeah that would be (inaudible),35:08.0,35:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7741,17,1,S2 ,and you have two b,,35:10.0,35:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7742,17,1,S2 ,and then we can now go,,35:11.0,35:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7743,17,1,S2 ,,(inaudible) to both sides and then we divide by (inaudible),35:13.0,35:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7744,17,1,S2 ,okay so divide by negative nine,,35:15.0,35:21.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7745,17,1,S2 ,,yeah and then (inaudible) forty-seven,35:22.0,35:37.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
7746,17,1,T2 ,,,35:27.0,55:44.0,20:17.0,,,,,,
7747,17,1,T2 ,,,35:27.0,35:54.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
7748,17,1,T2 ,so it's negative nine two,,35:38.0,35:52.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
7749,17,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm,35:46.0,35:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7750,17,1,T2 ,,,35:54.0,36:15.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
7751,17,1,T2 ,we have seventy-two equals negative eight,,35:57.0,36:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7752,17,1,T2 ,,oh they gave you the numbers,36:01.0,36:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7753,17,1,T2 ,yes they gave me good numbers,,36:03.0,36:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7754,17,1,T2 ,,wow,36:07.0,36:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7755,17,1,T2 ,I am very happy about this,,36:07.0,36:14.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7756,17,1,T2 ,,wow,36:14.0,36:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7757,17,1,T2 ,,,36:15.0,36:44.0,00:29.0,,,,,,
7758,17,1,T2 ,(inaudible) always great to make way,,36:15.0,36:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7759,17,1,T2 ,,and we add fourteen,36:17.0,36:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7760,17,1,T2 ,,right we have,36:20.0,36:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7761,17,1,T2 ,,and then you subtract sixty-five (inaudible) to the other side,36:22.0,36:31.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7762,17,1,T2 ,,we have this one,36:31.0,36:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7763,17,1,T2 ,okay that's eighty-five thirty-five forty-two,,36:33.0,36:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7764,17,1,T2 ,that's it,,36:39.0,36:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7765,17,1,T2 ,,pause filler let's see one of seven sixty x forty-two,36:39.0,36:49.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7766,17,1,T2 ,,,36:44.0,37:15.0,00:31.0,,,,,,
7767,17,1,T2 ,okay forty-two is six so,,36:49.0,36:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7768,17,1,T2 ,,sixty-eight seven,36:55.0,36:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7769,17,1,T2 ,so we have three,,36:57.0,36:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7770,17,1,T2 ,,so seven,36:59.0,37:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7771,17,1,T2 ,yeah it's three,,37:00.0,37:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7772,17,1,T2 ,,six over yeah it's six over two rather and then,37:06.0,37:08.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7773,17,1,T2 ,,yeah pause filler they really gave you good numbers,37:08.0,37:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7774,17,1,T2 ,at least these ones work (laughter),,37:09.0,37:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7775,17,1,T2 ,,,37:15.0,37:33.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
7776,17,1,T2 ,and so we have seventy-five equals negative nine k,,37:17.0,37:24.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7777,17,1,T2 ,pause filler this one doesn't divide well,,37:25.0,37:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7778,17,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm,37:29.0,37:29.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7779,17,1,T2 ,I've reached the stopping point,,37:29.0,37:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7780,17,1,T2 ,,,37:33.0,38:01.0,00:28.0,,,,,,
7781,17,1,T2 ,,so you just leave it as a fraction,37:34.0,37:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7782,17,1,T2 ,okay and so dah,,37:39.0,37:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7783,17,1,T2 ,actually this can be simplified,,37:42.0,37:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7784,17,1,T2 ,because this is divisible by three,,37:45.0,37:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7785,17,1,T2 ,,and so is that,37:47.0,37:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7786,17,1,T2 ,and this is also divisible,,37:48.0,37:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7787,17,1,T2 ,,so it would be twenty-five over thirty,37:50.0,37:56.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7788,17,1,T2 ,yup actually that's negative twenty-five over thirty because,,37:56.0,38:05.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7789,17,1,T2 ,,,38:01.0,38:51.0,00:50.0,,,,,,
7790,17,1,T2 ,,oh yeah yeah yeah yeah negative twenty-five over three,38:05.0,38:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7791,17,1,T2 ,okay here we want to be sure,,38:07.0,38:13.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7792,17,1,T2 ,that looks like a different,,38:13.0,38:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7793,17,1,T2 ,,so you add p,38:14.0,38:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7794,17,1,T2 ,,then you what subtract the fifty-two,38:15.0,38:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7795,17,1,T2 ,that's nineteen minus,,38:18.0,38:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7796,17,1,T2 ,so we would add sixteen to both sides,,38:20.0,38:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7797,17,1,T2 ,and then we have fifty-two,,38:23.0,38:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7798,17,1,T2 ,I can't write but fifty-two minus sixteen,,38:28.0,38:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7799,17,1,T2 ,we can just do so crossover carrying,,38:32.0,38:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7800,17,1,T2 ,and then we get negative thirty,,38:35.0,38:41.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7801,17,1,T2 ,I can't write (inaudible) anything like a thirty and little,,38:42.0,38:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7802,17,1,T2 ,do you know thirty-six is a (inaudible),,38:48.0,38:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7803,17,1,T2 ,,pause filler four,38:50.0,38:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7804,17,1,T2 ,yeah,,38:50.0,38:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7805,17,1,T2 ,,g equals four,38:52.0,38:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7806,17,1,T2 ,negative four,,38:54.0,38:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7807,17,1,T2 ,,negative four so you just,38:56.0,38:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7808,17,1,T2 ,,oh you add the fourteen and then,38:59.0,39:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7809,17,1,T2 ,,,39:00.0,39:50.0,00:50.0,,,,,,
7810,17,1,T2 ,add fourteen,,39:01.0,39:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7811,17,1,T2 ,and subtract nineteen,,39:01.0,39:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7812,17,1,T2 ,it doesn't really matter to which side you actually choose it just,,39:03.0,39:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7813,17,1,T2 ,,you absolutely the variable,39:08.0,39:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7814,17,1,T2 ,that's one sixty equals,,39:13.0,39:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7815,17,1,T2 ,I sort of just did both okay,,39:16.0,39:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7816,17,1,T2 ,pause filler I don't like doing two steps at once but yeah,,39:20.0,39:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7817,17,1,T2 ,and so fourteen w (laughter) oh my w just fell off,,39:26.0,39:34.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7818,17,1,T2 ,these don't even look like numbers anymore,,39:34.0,39:40.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7819,17,1,T2 ,and now we have forty w fifty divided by forty,,39:40.0,39:47.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7820,17,1,T2 ,and then we have negative,,39:47.0,39:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7821,17,1,T2 ,,,39:50.0,40:47.0,00:57.0,,,,,,
7822,17,1,T2 ,,is that one sixty,39:50.0,39:54.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7823,17,1,T2 ,oh yeah one sixty,,39:54.0,39:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7824,17,1,T2 ,,yeah so negative forty times,39:57.0,39:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7825,17,1,T2 ,and then negative four it would be one thousand six hundred if it was forty squared,,39:59.0,40:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7826,17,1,T2 ,okay stop come out and get us ignore ignore next question (laughter),,40:05.0,40:11.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7827,17,1,T2 ,,okay add y to each side,40:11.0,40:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7828,17,1,T2 ,,and then you just subtract to forty-three,40:14.0,40:23.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7829,17,1,T2 ,,and that's negative,40:23.0,40:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7830,17,1,T2 ,,I don't know what it is,40:25.0,40:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7831,17,1,T2 ,pause filler negative one o six is it easy,,40:27.0,40:33.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7832,17,1,T2 ,and we have fifty-three,,40:35.0,40:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7833,17,1,T2 ,negative fifty-three equals x,,40:36.0,40:40.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7834,17,1,T2 ,this is hard to write with,,40:41.0,40:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7835,17,1,T2 ,and then we add,,40:43.0,40:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7836,17,1,T2 ,,,40:47.0,42:00.0,01:13.0,,,,,,
7837,17,1,T2 ,,and be the new what's it called,40:51.0,40:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7838,17,1,T2 ,,subtract or add one eighty-two,40:54.0,40:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7839,17,1,T2 ,,do you add one eighty-two,40:57.0,40:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7840,17,1,T2 ,pause filler no since we put the p to this side,,40:59.0,41:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7841,17,1,T2 ,we may have the constant,,41:02.0,41:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7842,17,1,T2 ,go to this side,,41:03.0,41:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7843,17,1,T2 ,so yeah you would subtract forty-eight,,41:05.0,41:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7844,17,1,T2 ,and we have one ninety negative two thirty equals two p,,41:09.0,41:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7845,17,1,T2 ,you're giving me nice numbers oh my god,,41:13.0,41:19.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7846,17,1,T2 ,,was it one fifteen,41:20.0,41:22.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7847,17,1,T2 ,yeah,,41:23.0,41:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7848,17,1,T2 ,,all right next number,41:24.0,41:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7849,17,1,T2 ,it's all nice numbers here,,41:31.0,41:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7850,17,1,T2 ,no unhappy numbers here,,41:36.0,41:41.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7851,17,1,T2 ,,no fractions,41:41.0,41:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7852,17,1,T2 ,yup no fractions (laughter) pause filler that is so hard to write,,41:43.0,41:56.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
7853,17,1,T2 ,and then we have fifty-six seventy-six yeah seventy-six another nice number,,41:57.0,42:16.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
7854,17,1,T2 ,,,42:05.0,42:40.0,00:35.0,,,,,,
7855,17,1,T2 ,,what's that two g,42:16.0,42:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7856,17,1,T2 ,yeah just so (inaudible) to be two g oh yeah,,42:18.0,42:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7857,17,1,T2 ,so we have thirty-eight,,42:20.0,42:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7858,17,1,T2 ,I always get the twos,,42:23.0,42:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7859,17,1,T2 ,it's magic another two,,42:27.0,42:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7860,17,1,T2 ,,and then they're all positive numbers so,42:34.0,42:46.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
7861,17,1,T2 ,,,42:44.0,43:29.0,00:45.0,,,,,,
7862,17,1,T2 ,yeah,,42:46.0,42:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7863,17,1,T2 ,,twenty something equals two,42:47.0,42:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7864,17,1,T2 ,pause filler let's see seven eight twenty-eight,,42:51.0,42:57.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7865,17,1,T2 ,,twenty-four twenty-eight yeah that's eight-two,42:57.0,43:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7866,17,1,T2 ,eight brings the two fifty-one so yeah and another two another divided by two,,43:02.0,43:18.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
7867,17,1,T2 ,,(inaudible) first,43:18.0,43:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7868,17,1,T2 ,and then we have plus of that,,43:21.0,43:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7869,17,1,T2 ,the next of both sides eighteen x minus twenty-five,,43:24.0,43:33.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7870,17,1,T2 ,,,43:29.0,44:34.0,01:05.0,,,,,,
7871,17,1,T2 ,and so we have the x equals (inaudible),,43:35.0,43:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7872,17,1,T2 ,I did not write the subtraction simple,,43:38.0,43:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7873,17,1,T2 ,and then we have negative forty,,43:43.0,43:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7874,17,1,T2 ,it's a non-pretty number (laughter),,43:46.0,43:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7875,17,1,T2 ,,yes,43:52.0,43:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7876,17,1,T2 ,we've got a non-pretty number here,,43:53.0,43:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7877,17,1,T2 ,oh they can be simplified okay pause filler yeah,,43:56.0,44:05.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7878,17,1,T2 ,,so pretty (inaudible) plus transform pause filler,44:05.0,44:10.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7879,17,1,T2 ,we have,,44:10.0,44:10.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7880,17,1,T2 ,,five and eight,44:11.0,44:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7881,17,1,T2 ,first two I think you can only do two,,44:13.0,44:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7882,17,1,T2 ,yeah you can only simplify it by dividing the two,,44:18.0,44:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7883,17,1,T2 ,next problem oh boy the numbers are bigger,,44:26.0,44:33.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7884,17,1,T2 ,so yeah actually I think,,44:34.0,44:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7885,17,1,T2 ,,,44:35.0,45:23.0,00:48.0,,,,,,
7886,17,1,T2 ,yeah this is a hundred,,44:39.0,44:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7887,17,1,T2 ,this is a hundred (laughter),,44:42.0,44:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7888,17,1,T2 ,it's not and this negative two hundred (laughter),,44:45.0,44:53.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7889,17,1,T2 ,,not so perfect numbers let's see if we can,44:54.0,44:58.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7890,17,1,T2 ,we've got okay,,44:58.0,45:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7891,17,1,T2 ,we've got negative two hundred equals one hundred x,,45:02.0,45:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7892,17,1,T2 ,like could be the answer here (laughter),,45:06.0,45:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7893,17,1,T2 ,,probably,45:11.0,45:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7894,17,1,T2 ,like I got to struggle with all the fractions,,45:12.0,45:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7895,17,1,T2 ,I had like this okay,,45:17.0,45:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7896,17,1,T2 ,,,45:23.0,46:31.0,01:08.0,,,,,,
7897,17,1,T2 ,and so we have twenty-two,,45:31.0,45:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7898,17,1,T2 ,which is two nineteen,,45:35.0,45:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7899,17,1,T2 ,we have thirty-one forty-one,,45:38.0,45:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7900,17,1,T2 ,I think this isn't going to be a pretty number,,45:41.0,45:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7901,17,1,T2 ,because forty-one is prime,,45:52.0,45:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7902,17,1,T2 ,we have twelve,,45:55.0,45:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7903,17,1,T2 ,my first non-pretty number here which can't be simplified oh,,46:05.0,46:12.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7904,17,1,T2 ,,same here,46:14.0,46:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7905,17,1,T2 ,because I know that it's not a pretty number,,46:16.0,46:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7906,17,1,T2 ,well the numbers are actually really big now (laughter),,46:19.0,46:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7907,17,1,T2 ,,yeah,46:27.0,46:27.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7908,17,1,T2 ,that's not easy,,46:27.0,46:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7909,17,1,T2 ,,,46:31.0,47:28.0,00:57.0,,,,,,
7910,17,1,T2 ,okay we've got a two hundred sixty-seven here pause filler one thirty-four,,46:34.0,46:48.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
7911,17,1,T2 ,no minus so we have,,46:48.0,46:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7912,17,1,T2 ,I do not,,46:51.0,46:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7913,17,1,T2 ,just write sixteen,,46:52.0,46:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7914,17,1,T2 ,you didn't see me right sixteen,,46:54.0,46:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7915,17,1,T2 ,oh we have two o six equals one thirty-four see,,46:57.0,47:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7916,17,1,T2 ,and so we divide by one thirty-four,,47:04.0,47:13.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7917,17,1,T2 ,,yeah (inaudible),47:13.0,47:14.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7918,17,1,T2 ,pause filler so simplification we can do this to one o three and five sixty-five sixty-seven,,47:14.0,47:24.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7919,17,1,T2 ,I think that's it (laughter),,47:26.0,47:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7920,17,1,T2 ,,,47:28.0,48:45.0,01:17.0,,,,,,
7921,17,1,T2 ,because these numbers one o three divided by sixty-seven equals three,,47:28.0,47:35.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7922,17,1,T2 ,,well I'm almost done,47:36.0,47:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7923,17,1,T2 ,yup and so yeah we can combine like terms here,,47:37.0,47:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7924,17,1,T2 ,so this should be negative fifteen p,,47:41.0,47:45.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7925,17,1,T2 ,is that a thirty,,47:46.0,47:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7926,17,1,T2 ,this is a thirty right,,47:48.0,47:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7927,17,1,T2 ,,fifty,47:50.0,47:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7928,17,1,T2 ,fifty,,47:51.0,47:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7929,17,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm,47:52.0,47:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7930,17,1,T2 ,okay,,47:53.0,47:53.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7931,17,1,T2 ,,yeah it's fifty,47:54.0,47:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7932,17,1,T2 ,it's block by text for me,,47:56.0,47:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7933,17,1,T2 ,,(inaudible),47:58.0,48:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7934,17,1,T2 ,so pause filler so we can add sixty p to both sides,,47:59.0,48:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7935,17,1,T2 ,and we have forty-five p here plus fifty equals negative one forty,,48:06.0,48:17.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7936,17,1,T2 ,now we subtract one fifty for both sides,,48:18.0,48:21.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7937,17,1,T2 ,and we have negative one ninety,,48:22.0,48:28.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7938,17,1,T2 ,so I'm allowed to put ninety there,,48:29.0,48:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7939,17,1,T2 ,,I don't know (inaudible) mostly nine,48:33.0,48:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7940,17,1,T2 ,pause filler it would be nice if that was nine eighty,,48:37.0,48:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7941,17,1,T2 ,I wished,,48:41.0,48:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7942,17,1,T2 ,,that's just a fraction,48:42.0,48:47.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7943,17,1,T2 ,,,48:45.0,49:51.0,01:06.0,,,,,,
7944,17,1,T2 ,I can't what am I doing,,48:50.0,48:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7945,17,1,T2 ,I can't simplify this,,48:52.0,48:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7946,17,1,T2 ,because they're both like fives,,48:55.0,48:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7947,17,1,T2 ,and I always pay attention to signs and so yes since they're both fives so twenty eighteen thirty-eight over nine,,48:59.0,49:21.0,00:22.0,,,,,,
7948,17,1,T2 ,,mm-hmm,49:10.0,49:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7949,17,1,T2 ,and yeah I think that's it so yeah twenty-two,,49:22.0,49:37.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
7950,17,1,T2 ,,two more questions,49:37.0,49:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7951,17,1,T2 ,yeah,,49:39.0,49:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7952,17,1,T2 ,,and then,49:42.0,49:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7953,17,1,T2 ,I suddenly just gave a (inaudible) rating everything pause filler,,49:45.0,49:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7954,17,1,T2 ,,negative four,49:50.0,49:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7955,17,1,T2 ,,,49:51.0,51:46.0,01:55.0,,,,,,
7956,17,1,T2 ,I know like sometimes the pen doesn't respond,,49:53.0,50:00.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7957,17,1,T2 ,so you get like half of the number,,50:00.0,50:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7958,17,1,T2 ,okay let's see one thirty,,50:11.0,50:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7959,17,1,T2 ,so that's one fifty-five one sixty,,50:13.0,50:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7960,17,1,T2 ,I was so close,,50:17.0,50:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7961,17,1,T2 ,why couldn't it be ten less,,50:19.0,50:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7962,17,1,T2 ,they heard your pretty or no pretty numbers okay so yeah,,50:24.0,50:33.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7963,17,1,T2 ,and you can just divide by ten,,50:34.0,50:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7964,17,1,T2 ,and that would be all,,50:39.0,50:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7965,17,1,T2 ,you can simplify,,50:40.0,50:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7966,17,1,T2 ,this is a six,,50:42.0,50:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7967,17,1,T2 ,,pause filler I don't know if that was a one,50:44.0,50:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
7968,17,1,T2 ,pause filler do you see anything on the stage,,50:50.0,50:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7969,17,1,T2 ,,no,50:55.0,50:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7970,17,1,T2 ,I'm going to draw an octopus there,,50:56.0,51:04.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
7971,17,1,T2 ,and there's nothing on that page either,,51:05.0,51:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
7972,17,1,T2 ,okay I can't actually pause filler (laughter) pause filler draw something like that,,51:07.0,51:30.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
7973,17,1,T2 ,and then you have that,,51:30.0,51:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7974,17,1,T2 ,and then it's like pickle,,51:33.0,51:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7975,17,1,T2 ,it's a pickle pause filler jellyfish,,51:38.0,51:54.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
7976,17,1,T2 ,,,51:52.0,53:12.0,01:20.0,,,,,,
7977,17,1,T2 ,,took a pickle,52:06.0,52:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7978,17,1,T2 ,to impersonate the pickle I think the hardest part about drawing is the lips,,52:10.0,52:28.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
7979,17,1,T2 ,mm-hmm,,52:28.0,52:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7980,17,1,T2 ,it's like something like that,,52:29.0,52:39.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
7981,17,1,T2 ,,the hardest part is the eye around myself,52:40.0,52:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
7982,17,1,T2 ,,pause filler I guess I'm going to go there to notify,53:03.0,53:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7983,17,1,T2 ,yeah it's better just (inaudible) than to make drawing poorly,,53:08.0,53:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7984,17,1,T2 ,oh let's think of some monster designs,,53:21.0,53:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
7985,17,1,T2 ,so oh that's (inaudible) something,,53:24.0,53:35.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7986,17,1,T2 ,yeah,,53:38.0,53:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7987,17,1,T2 ,,bye,53:59.0,54:00.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7988,17,1,T2 ,okay bye pause filler yeah,,54:00.0,54:01.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
7989,17,2,S1 ,,,00:57.0,06:12.0,05:15.0,,,,,,
7990,17,2,S1 ,okay,,03:07.0,03:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,

7993,17,2,S1 ,,it's so weird obviously not to leave after,03:17.0,03:26.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
7994,17,2,S1 ,,this is our second time,03:28.0,03:39.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
7995,17,2,S1 ,pause filler stylus,,06:20.0,06:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
7996,17,2,S1 ,okay so pause filler you want to start,,06:25.0,06:32.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7997,17,2,S1 ,,I don't leave the room (inaudible),06:35.0,06:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
7998,17,2,S1 ,okay so this is the same like all the last problems,,06:40.0,06:47.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
7999,17,2,S1 ,you want to get the x,,06:47.0,06:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8000,17,2,S1 ,okay so we want to get x over to one side,,06:52.0,07:04.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8001,17,2,S1 ,and so just imagine this as like a whole number not three ahead of seven not a fraction,,07:04.0,07:14.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8002,17,2,S1 ,so if this was a whole number what would you do,,07:14.0,07:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8003,17,2,S1 ,,pause filler subtract I think yeah subtract,07:17.0,07:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8004,17,2,S1 ,no because this since okay so when basically when you see a number and there's no sign in between,,07:23.0,07:41.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
8005,17,2,S1 ,this means multiplication,,07:41.0,07:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8006,17,2,S1 ,,mm-hmm (inaudible),07:43.0,07:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8007,17,2,S1 ,yeah okay so basically when dividing with fractions you do something called the reciprocal,,07:44.0,07:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8008,17,2,T1  ,,,07:47.0,27:55.0,20:08.0,,,,,,
8009,17,2,T1  ,,,07:47.0,12:19.0,04:32.0,,,,,,
8010,17,2,T1  ,and so you know the numerator and the denominator right,,07:50.0,07:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8011,17,2,T1  ,,mm-hmm,07:55.0,07:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8012,17,2,T1  ,so the reciprocal is when you flip them,,07:55.0,08:00.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8013,17,2,T1  ,so like the reciprocal of this would be four over three or,,08:00.0,08:07.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8014,17,2,T1  ,,seven over four seven over four,08:07.0,08:11.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8015,17,2,T1  ,yeah seven over four I think and x,,08:11.0,08:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8016,17,2,T1  ,,I mean seven over three,08:15.0,08:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8017,17,2,T1  ,yeah seven over three and so when dividing by a fraction multiplying by the reciprocal is the same thing,,08:16.0,08:24.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8018,17,2,T1  ,so if you wanted to divide this forty by three over seven the same as multiplying forty by seven over three,,08:25.0,08:34.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8019,17,2,T1  ,so now that you know that can you do this problem,,08:34.0,08:40.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8020,17,2,T1  ,,pause filler so multiply those sides by the reciprocal right,08:40.0,08:45.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8021,17,2,T1  ,yeah,,08:46.0,08:46.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8022,17,2,T1  ,,oh my gosh that sucks,08:46.0,08:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8023,17,2,T1  ,,yeah that sucks,08:53.0,08:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8024,17,2,T1  ,(laughter) so bad at writing,,08:56.0,08:57.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8025,17,2,T1  ,,that is a three,08:57.0,09:08.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8026,17,2,T1  ,,that's three,09:08.0,09:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8027,17,2,T1  ,yeah that's a three (laughter),,09:09.0,09:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8028,17,2,T1  ,,that equals one right,09:11.0,09:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8029,17,2,T1  ,yeah,,09:16.0,09:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8030,17,2,T1  ,,all right yeah and okay so one x all right,09:17.0,09:25.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8031,17,2,T1  ,yeah one x equals,,09:25.0,09:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8032,17,2,T1  ,,equals pause filler forty-seven,09:27.0,09:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8033,17,2,T1  ,,I mean forty time seven so,09:30.0,09:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8034,17,2,T1  ,,I don't know,09:31.0,09:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8035,17,2,T1  ,forty times seven over three,,09:32.0,09:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8036,17,2,T1  ,,yeah you could just spell it,09:35.0,09:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8037,17,2,T1  ,what,,09:38.0,09:38.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8038,17,2,T1  ,,I said we can just write it that way,09:38.0,09:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8039,17,2,T1  ,pause filler so basically you can't just have forty times seven over three,,09:42.0,09:49.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8040,17,2,T1  ,so what you can do,,09:49.0,09:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8041,17,2,T1  ,pause filler multiplying via fractions is really troublesome,,09:51.0,09:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8042,17,2,T1  ,so do you agree that forty is the same as forty over one,,09:55.0,10:02.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8043,17,2,T1  ,,uh-huh,10:02.0,10:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8044,17,2,T1  ,and so when multiplying fractions what you want to do is,,10:03.0,10:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8045,17,2,T1  ,you want to multiply the two numerators and the two denominators,,10:08.0,10:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8046,17,2,T1  ,so we have forty times seven,,10:10.0,10:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8047,17,2,T1  ,,yeah,10:14.0,10:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8048,17,2,T1  ,that's those yeah pause filler over three and that would be our answer,,10:18.0,10:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8049,17,2,T1  ,because we're multiplying forty by seven over three,,10:23.0,10:29.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8050,17,2,T1  ,,okay so,10:31.0,10:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8051,17,2,T1  ,and then so basically the last step would be just to simplify forty times seven (laughter),,10:32.0,10:39.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8052,17,2,T1  ,,okay so forty so four times seven is twenty-eight so two eighty,10:39.0,10:45.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8053,17,2,T1  ,yeah yeah so it would be two eighty over three,,10:45.0,10:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8054,17,2,T1  ,,okay you don't have to write that down,10:47.0,10:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8055,17,2,T1  ,,I'll write that down,10:50.0,10:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8056,17,2,T1  ,,that's equals two,10:51.0,10:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8057,17,2,T1  ,,yeah it's not going to work out,10:54.0,10:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8058,17,2,T1  ,by the way two eighty is not divisible by three,,11:00.0,11:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8059,17,2,T1  ,so you can just write twenty-three over three,,11:03.0,11:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8060,17,2,T1  ,,yeah,11:06.0,11:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8061,17,2,T1  ,an easy way to know if something is divisible by three is to add up all of the digits,,11:09.0,11:15.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8062,17,2,T1  ,so you would add up two and zero,,11:16.0,11:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8063,17,2,T1  ,and if the sum is divisible by three then the number is divisible by three,,11:18.0,11:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8064,17,2,T1  ,so that's basically it's a cool trick so the next problem,,11:24.0,11:31.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8065,17,2,T1  ,,okay so,11:31.0,11:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8066,17,2,T1  ,so now that you know what to do with fraction,,11:32.0,11:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8067,17,2,T1  ,,okay so fourteen equals x so (inaudible) one k,11:36.0,11:52.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
8068,17,2,T1  ,yup,,11:57.0,11:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8069,17,2,T1  ,,and then you can just multiply the fourteen,11:58.0,12:02.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8070,17,2,T1  ,yeah that's very hard (laughter),,12:11.0,12:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8071,17,2,T1  ,,it's really hard,12:15.0,12:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8072,17,2,T1  ,okay so,,12:18.0,12:18.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8073,17,2,T1  ,,wait can we just do fourteen times three over eight,12:19.0,12:25.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8074,17,2,T1  ,,,12:19.0,15:11.0,02:52.0,,,,,,
8075,17,2,T1  ,pause filler remember reciprocal so reciprocal of,,12:25.0,12:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8076,17,2,T1  ,,fourteen times eight over,12:30.0,12:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8077,17,2,T1  ,yeah so fourteen times eight over three because it's fourteen over one so,,12:32.0,12:44.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8078,17,2,T1  ,okay do you know fifteen times eight,,12:44.0,12:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8079,17,2,T1  ,pause filler okay so you can take the eight and say it's a ten,,12:46.0,12:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8080,17,2,T1  ,,mm-hmm,12:51.0,12:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8081,17,2,T1  ,then you can solve it right,,12:51.0,12:56.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8082,17,2,T1  ,you know fourteen times ten,,12:56.0,12:59.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8083,17,2,T1  ,,pause filler it's a forty,12:59.0,13:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8084,17,2,T1  ,okay so once you know that since eight is two less than ten that means that it's two fourteens less,,13:03.0,13:15.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8085,17,2,T1  ,so what you can do is you can just,,13:15.0,13:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8086,17,2,T1  ,,so one forty minus twenty,13:19.0,13:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8087,17,2,T1  ,yeah one forty minus twenty-eight is the same thing as fourteen times eight,,13:23.0,13:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8088,17,2,T1  ,,okay one forty minus twenty-eight so one forty minus twenty is one twenty,13:27.0,13:33.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8089,17,2,T1  ,,and then minus eight is one twelve,13:33.0,13:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8090,17,2,T1  ,yeah so it would be one twelve over three which is,,13:35.0,13:42.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8091,17,2,T1  ,,oh my gosh,13:42.0,13:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8092,17,2,T1  ,which is not divisible by three so what I can tell,,13:44.0,13:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8093,17,2,T1  ,,one twelve,13:48.0,13:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8094,17,2,T1  ,I bet you are going to get to my problems is going to be all pretty numbers (laughter) like an octopus,,13:49.0,14:02.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8095,17,2,T1  ,,jeez,14:03.0,14:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8096,17,2,T1  ,that's not anything like I an octopus (laughter),,14:04.0,14:08.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8097,17,2,T1  ,,this is so hard,14:09.0,14:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8098,17,2,T1  ,and that equals k okay next problem,,14:11.0,14:20.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8099,17,2,T1  ,,all right add eighteen,14:20.0,14:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8100,17,2,T1  ,,so it will be negative two over three y equals pause filler seventy,14:23.0,14:38.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
8101,17,2,T1  ,yeah,,14:38.0,14:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8102,17,2,T1  ,,and then,14:39.0,14:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8103,17,2,T1  ,maybe add this negative two over three,,14:40.0,14:47.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8104,17,2,T1  ,so what's the reciprocal,,14:47.0,14:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8105,17,2,T1  ,,no there are over ten right,14:49.0,14:55.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8106,17,2,T1  ,what,,14:55.0,14:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8107,17,2,T1  ,,negative three over two,14:56.0,15:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8108,17,2,T1  ,yeah so you want to multiply that right,,15:00.0,15:08.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8109,17,2,T1  ,I mean yeah you would want to multiply it,,15:08.0,15:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8110,17,2,T1  ,,,15:11.0,16:56.0,01:45.0,,,,,,
8111,17,2,T1  ,,you know what,15:12.0,15:13.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8112,17,2,T1  ,this is going to turn out to be a nice number,,15:14.0,15:21.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8113,17,2,T1  ,,pause filler that's (inaudible),15:21.0,15:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8114,17,2,T1  ,yeah (laughter),,15:23.0,15:23.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8115,17,2,T1  ,,okay so that will be negative two hundred I mean two ten,15:26.0,15:34.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8116,17,2,T1  ,yeah,,15:34.0,15:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8117,17,2,T1  ,,over two,15:42.0,15:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8118,17,2,T1  ,mm-hmm and two ten is,,15:45.0,15:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8119,17,2,T1  ,,and simplify,15:48.0,15:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8120,17,2,T1  ,yeah,,15:51.0,15:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8121,17,2,T1  ,,is one of five,15:51.0,15:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8122,17,2,T1  ,yeah,,15:54.0,15:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8123,17,2,T1  ,,right yeah one of five equals y,15:54.0,15:57.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8124,17,2,T1  ,pause filler don't forget the negative sign,,15:59.0,16:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8125,17,2,T1  ,,yeah,16:02.0,16:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8126,17,2,T1  ,I can't circle them (laughter),,16:02.0,16:06.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8127,17,2,T1  ,I just erased it okay so yeah,,16:06.0,16:14.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8128,17,2,T1  ,,pause filler subtract thirteen,16:14.0,16:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8129,17,2,T1  ,yup,,16:15.0,16:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8130,17,2,T1  ,,so one two x or (inaudible),16:17.0,16:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8131,17,2,T1  ,that looks like a two,,16:21.0,16:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8132,17,2,T1  ,I can see a two,,16:25.0,16:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8133,17,2,T1  ,,that equals twenty-one,16:30.0,16:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8134,17,2,T1  ,no it's a forty-four,,16:33.0,16:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8135,17,2,T1  ,,thirty-one,16:35.0,16:38.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8136,17,2,T1  ,yes just change the two into one (laughter),,16:42.0,16:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8137,17,2,T1  ,,and so then that's when you flip it around so thirty-one times two,16:44.0,16:51.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8138,17,2,T1  ,nice number,,16:52.0,16:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8139,17,2,T1  ,,yeah and then it's just two times two pretty much,16:55.0,17:14.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
8140,17,2,T1  ,,,16:56.0,18:09.0,01:13.0,,,,,,
8141,17,2,T1  ,yeah (inaudible),,17:14.0,17:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8142,17,2,T1  ,,which is sixty-two,17:15.0,17:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8143,17,2,T1  ,so yeah x equals sixty-two,,17:18.0,17:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8144,17,2,T1  ,,all right,17:20.0,17:21.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8145,17,2,T1  ,next problem,,17:21.0,17:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8146,17,2,T1  ,,add sixteen,17:23.0,17:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8147,17,2,T1  ,yup,,17:25.0,17:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8148,17,2,T1  ,,(inaudible),17:26.0,17:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8149,17,2,T1  ,yup forty-seven,,17:27.0,17:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8150,17,2,T1  ,,equals three negative six x yeah this is (inaudible),17:29.0,17:35.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8151,17,2,T1  ,okay so something you can notice is three over six,,17:35.0,17:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8152,17,2,T1  ,,it's half,17:40.0,17:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8153,17,2,T1  ,three over six yeah it's a half,,17:41.0,17:47.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8154,17,2,T1  ,,mm-hmm oh another half number,17:47.0,17:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8155,17,2,T1  ,yeah nice number,,17:53.0,17:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8156,17,2,T1  ,,it doesn't pause filler two (inaudible) then pause filler three twenty,17:56.0,18:01.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8157,17,2,T1  ,oh that's ninety-four,,18:01.0,18:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8158,17,2,T1  ,,ninety-four,18:07.0,18:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8159,17,2,T1  ,yeah ninety-four yeah,,18:08.0,18:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8160,17,2,T1  ,,,18:09.0,19:37.0,01:28.0,,,,,,
8161,17,2,T1  ,,equals x,18:13.0,18:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8162,17,2,T1  ,oh can I do this,,18:16.0,18:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8163,17,2,T1  ,can I draw a circle yay (laughter),,18:20.0,18:25.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8164,17,2,T1  ,yay next problem I did tap it yeah okay problem six,,18:26.0,18:40.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
8165,17,2,T1  ,,pause filler so that's forty-eight,18:40.0,18:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8166,17,2,T1  ,yeah,,18:44.0,18:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8167,17,2,T1  ,,so this is pause filler forty-one no forty-nine,18:45.0,18:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8168,17,2,T1  ,see fifty-seven yeah forty-nine,,18:49.0,18:57.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8169,17,2,T1  ,,yeah forty-nine,18:58.0,19:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8170,17,2,T1  ,yeah,,19:02.0,19:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8171,17,2,T1  ,,equals twelve over negative twelve over five,19:04.0,19:13.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8172,17,2,T1  ,five,,19:14.0,19:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8173,17,2,T1  ,,well,19:16.0,19:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8174,17,2,T1  ,something like not (inaudible) five,,19:18.0,19:22.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8175,17,2,T1  ,,okay so the reciprocal would be forty-nine times five negative five,19:22.0,19:37.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
8176,17,2,T1  ,,,19:37.0,22:07.0,02:30.0,,,,,,
8177,17,2,T1  ,okay twelve,,19:42.0,19:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8178,17,2,T1  ,,okay so four times negative five equals fifty,19:48.0,19:55.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8179,17,2,T1  ,,times five will be a hundred twenty-five,19:56.0,20:03.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8180,17,2,T1  ,,well I think it's just twenty-five,20:03.0,20:10.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8181,17,2,T1  ,fifty times five is,,20:10.0,20:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8182,17,2,T1  ,,two fifty right three times five seventy,20:16.0,20:22.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8183,17,2,T1  ,yeah yeah it's two fifty so,,20:23.0,20:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8184,17,2,T1  ,,so I mean one fifty less,20:26.0,20:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8185,17,2,T1  ,no so you go one five less yeah,,20:30.0,20:36.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8186,17,2,T1  ,,oh one five less okay so then it will be two forty-five,20:36.0,20:43.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8187,17,2,T1  ,yeah and don't forget the negative sign on the five,,20:44.0,20:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8188,17,2,T1  ,so that would be negative two,,20:56.0,21:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8189,17,2,T1  ,,negative two forty-five,21:00.0,21:07.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8190,17,2,T1  ,and that will never be divisible by twelve,,21:08.0,21:35.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
8191,17,2,T1  ,because we had a five,,21:35.0,21:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8192,17,2,T1  ,and twelve multiplies a twelve can only be even numbers,,21:39.0,21:47.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8193,17,2,T1  ,,that's a y,21:47.0,21:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8194,17,2,T1  ,yeah okay equals y yeah negative y y (inaudible),,21:49.0,21:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8195,17,2,T1  ,,pause filler add sixty-one,21:52.0,21:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8196,17,2,T1  ,yeah,,21:55.0,21:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8197,17,2,T1  ,,multiply y by each side,21:55.0,21:57.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8198,17,2,T1  ,don't forget we have the y here,,21:57.0,22:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8199,17,2,T1  ,,yeah and that's why I said multiply a y,22:00.0,22:07.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8200,17,2,T1  ,and don't forget this is an addition sign,,22:07.0,22:11.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8201,17,2,T1  ,,,22:07.0,27:55.0,05:48.0,,,,,,
8202,17,2,T1  ,,oh then subtract y,22:11.0,22:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8203,17,2,T1  ,yeah okay so you want to subtract y,,22:13.0,22:18.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8204,17,2,T1  ,,mm-hmm so,22:18.0,22:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8205,17,2,T1  ,and so basically when the y is like this you can think of it as one times y,,22:19.0,22:27.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8206,17,2,T1  ,and so you can also think of one as seven over seven,,22:28.0,22:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8207,17,2,T1  ,do you agree that the fraction is seven over seven also goes one over one,,22:35.0,22:48.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8208,17,2,T1  ,so when you have negative six over seven and you're subtracting another seven over seven,,22:48.0,22:57.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8209,17,2,T1  ,so what actually what did you get here,,22:57.0,23:03.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8210,17,2,T1  ,you have negative six over seven,,23:03.0,23:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8211,17,2,T1  ,that's not a seven minus seven over seven,,23:09.0,23:15.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8212,17,2,T1  ,,okay I think one over (inaudible),23:15.0,23:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8213,17,2,T1  ,okay so basically pause filler when subtracting fractions if the denominator is the same in which in this case they are,,23:20.0,23:41.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
8214,17,2,T1  ,because we have the sevens,,23:41.0,23:48.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8215,17,2,T1  ,what you can do is you can just take this number,,23:57.0,24:09.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8216,17,2,T1  ,and this number just subtracts,,24:09.0,24:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8217,17,2,T1  ,so you just have negative six over seven,,24:12.0,24:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8218,17,2,T1  ,so what's negative six minus seven,,24:18.0,24:23.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8219,17,2,T1  ,,pause filler negative fourteen no negative thirteen,24:23.0,24:34.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8220,17,2,T1  ,thirteen yeah so we just have negative thirteen over seven,,24:34.0,24:47.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8221,17,2,T1  ,I am failing at writing this,,24:47.0,24:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8222,17,2,T1  ,,so negative thirteen over seven,24:54.0,25:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8223,17,2,T1  ,y equals eighty-six,,25:00.0,25:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8224,17,2,T1  ,,oh yeah yeah yeah,25:02.0,25:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8225,17,2,T1  ,and then we can just use,,25:04.0,25:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8226,17,2,T1  ,,oh my gosh,25:07.0,25:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8227,17,2,T1  ,(inaudible) wait we haven't done the negative thirteen,,25:10.0,25:18.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8228,17,2,T1  ,,oh (inaudible) okay,25:18.0,25:19.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8229,17,2,T1  ,yeah we haven't finished the problem yet,,25:19.0,25:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8230,17,2,T1  ,we just got it done to,,25:24.0,25:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8231,17,2,T1  ,negative thirteen over seven y equals eighty-six,,25:28.0,25:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8232,17,2,T1  ,,and then that's just negative to pause filler reciprocal,25:34.0,25:43.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8233,17,2,T1  ,yeah,,25:46.0,25:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8234,17,2,T1  ,,oh I do seven times seven I don't even know,25:47.0,25:51.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8235,17,2,T1  ,pause filler okay eighty-seven times seven so things like this you just do it on like (inaudible) things,,25:52.0,26:06.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
8236,17,2,T1  ,pause filler seven times eight that's fifty-six,,26:09.0,26:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8237,17,2,T1  ,okay so it's sixty-nine (laughter),,26:13.0,26:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8238,17,2,T1  ,this is like pause filler,,26:17.0,26:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8239,17,2,T1  ,basically what I just did here is basically what you want to do if you have trouble doing multiplication pause filler six o nine,,26:19.0,26:34.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
8240,17,2,T1  ,,(inaudible),26:34.0,26:34.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8241,17,2,T1  ,that is divisible by seven,,26:34.0,26:40.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8242,17,2,T1  ,,(inaudible),26:40.0,26:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8243,17,2,T1  ,yeah it is,,26:40.0,26:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8244,17,2,T1  ,okay so seven times a hundred is seven hundred right,,26:42.0,26:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8245,17,2,T1  ,,mm-hmm,26:48.0,26:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8246,17,2,T1  ,and so the difference between that and six hundred nine is ninety-one right,,26:48.0,26:56.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8247,17,2,T1  ,and so in ninety-one you can split ninety-one into twenty-one and seventy,,26:56.0,27:06.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8248,17,2,T1  ,which are both divisible by seven,,27:06.0,27:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8249,17,2,T1  ,so we have seven times a hundred minus seven times three minus seven times ten,,27:11.0,27:29.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
8250,17,2,T1  ,so yeah the answer is basically,,27:29.0,27:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8251,17,2,T1  ,you take all of these numbers,,27:33.0,27:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8252,17,2,T1  ,and then when you add them all out,,27:39.0,27:48.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8253,17,2,T1  ,so when you add a hundred negative three at negative ten,,27:48.0,28:00.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8254,17,2,T1  ,and basically what you get is the number that you multiply seven by to get six o nine,,28:00.0,28:29.0,00:29.0,,,,,,
8255,17,2,T1  ,,okay so divided by thirteen equals pause filler what was it thirty-seven,28:30.0,28:57.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
8256,17,2,T1  ,you know what,,28:58.0,29:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8257,17,2,T1  ,we just did it over here,,29:02.0,29:09.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8258,17,2,S2 ,,,29:06.0,34:36.0,05:30.0,,,,,,
8259,17,2,S2 ,we're dumb (laughter) oh my god,,29:10.0,29:16.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8260,17,2,S2 ,,that's what (inaudible),29:17.0,29:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8261,17,2,S2 ,oh wait no because wait pause filler,,29:21.0,29:37.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
8262,17,2,S2 ,,(inaudible) got the seven,29:37.0,29:45.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8263,17,2,S2 ,oh okay I did this wrong,,29:45.0,29:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8264,17,2,S2 ,because we (inaudible) eighty-seven by a thirteen,,29:50.0,30:19.0,00:29.0,,,,,,
8265,17,2,S2 ,,yeah I think that's (inaudible),30:19.0,30:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8266,17,2,S2 ,I'll just do that now,,30:21.0,30:29.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8267,17,2,S2 ,okay so basically the way that (inaudible),,30:29.0,31:08.0,00:39.0,,,,,,
8268,17,2,S2 ,okay,,35:00.0,35:00.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8269,17,2,S2 ,,well you got an easy one,35:00.0,35:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8270,17,2,S2 ,,that's surprising,35:02.0,35:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8271,17,2,S2 ,yeah I'm in black,,35:08.0,35:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8272,17,2,S2 ,okay I'm like this to write (inaudible),,35:10.0,35:13.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8273,17,2,S2 ,,no essentially how do you get all the easy ones,35:13.0,35:22.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8274,17,2,S2 ,okay by the way this is supposed to be twenty-five not just a random scribbles,,35:22.0,35:30.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8275,17,2,S2 ,,mm-hmm,35:30.0,35:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8276,17,2,S2 ,okay eighty y equals negative,,35:30.0,35:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8277,17,2,S2 ,okay if I write extremely big maybe,,35:32.0,35:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8278,17,2,S2 ,they don't work (laughter),,35:36.0,35:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8279,17,2,S2 ,okay next problem we have minus fifty-four,,35:38.0,35:44.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8280,17,2,S2 ,,so subtracting it,35:44.0,35:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8281,17,2,S2 ,one twelve wait so it's one twelve,,35:46.0,35:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8282,17,2,S2 ,and then we have sixty-two yeah sixty-two (laughter),,35:51.0,36:00.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8283,17,2,T2 ,,,35:54.0,56:48.0,20:54.0,,,,,,
8284,17,2,T2 ,,,35:54.0,36:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8285,17,2,T2 ,,,36:00.0,36:32.0,00:32.0,,,,,,
8286,17,2,T2 ,and pause filler it's wonderful my writing skills,,36:01.0,36:08.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8287,17,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),36:01.0,36:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8288,17,2,T2 ,the thing is I don't think it's a problem of the touchpad,,36:08.0,36:19.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8289,17,2,T2 ,I think it's the problem of the actual the pause filler the scribbler thing,,36:19.0,36:27.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8290,17,2,T2 ,,and actually the website,36:27.0,36:31.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8291,17,2,T2 ,and you know what,,36:31.0,36:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8292,17,2,T2 ,I figured it out what I've been doing wrong this entire time,,36:33.0,36:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8293,17,2,T2 ,I was holding the pen backwards,,36:37.0,36:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8294,17,2,T2 ,,(inaudible) at this right,36:43.0,36:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8295,17,2,T2 ,,,36:44.0,38:16.0,01:32.0,,,,,,
8296,17,2,T2 ,I was holding it like this with that (laughter) like finally for choosing out so yeah,,36:45.0,36:53.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8297,17,2,T2 ,it's writing a lot to me there now (laughter) oh my gosh,,36:54.0,36:59.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8298,17,2,T2 ,,wow pretty easy,37:01.0,37:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8299,17,2,T2 ,yeah I don't have to multiply fractions or anything,,37:03.0,37:09.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8300,17,2,T2 ,I just have to take this y,,37:09.0,37:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8301,17,2,T2 ,and leave it to here it's like,,37:12.0,37:24.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8302,17,2,T2 ,and this is seven,,37:25.0,37:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8303,17,2,T2 ,so we have negative two over thirty which can simplify the one of forty fifteen,,37:27.0,37:40.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8304,17,2,T2 ,,can't you find a lot of (inaudible),37:40.0,37:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8305,17,2,T2 ,yeah (laughter),,37:43.0,37:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8306,17,2,T2 ,,because you know,37:44.0,37:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8307,17,2,T2 ,,pause filler and I have to leave half of this,37:46.0,37:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8308,17,2,T2 ,okay so that's a four pause filler one thirty-three over one thirty-seven oh,,37:51.0,38:00.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8309,17,2,T2 ,yeah it's not a nice number okay let's yeah,,38:01.0,38:20.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
8310,17,2,T2 ,,,38:16.0,38:52.0,00:36.0,,,,,,
8311,17,2,T2 ,,pause filler when you have thirty-nine,38:21.0,38:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8312,17,2,T2 ,I'm going to take this step by step,,38:26.0,38:32.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8313,17,2,T2 ,,no I'm going to say,38:32.0,38:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8314,17,2,T2 ,,let me add the thirty-nine to get that seventeen number x five so mm-hmm,38:35.0,38:44.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8315,17,2,T2 ,normally I would,,38:44.0,38:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8316,17,2,T2 ,but see this is a lot easier to understand right,,38:45.0,38:53.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8317,17,2,T2 ,and then I would add thirty-nine,,38:53.0,38:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8318,17,2,T2 ,basically what I did is,,38:57.0,39:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8319,17,2,T2 ,I think the x (inaudible) twelve over x from a fraction by just multiplying by multiplying x's to both sides,,39:00.0,39:13.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8320,17,2,T2 ,,,39:01.0,39:47.0,00:46.0,,,,,,
8321,17,2,T2 ,so it makes it a lot easier to understand for me mm-hmm nine eighteen yeah eighteen,,39:13.0,39:26.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8322,17,2,T2 ,so five x equals eighteen,,39:28.0,39:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8323,17,2,T2 ,and yes x equals eighteen oh (inaudible),,39:34.0,39:43.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8324,17,2,T2 ,,yeah so yeah (inaudible) first well not many of it in that way,39:43.0,39:51.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8325,17,2,T2 ,,,39:47.0,40:55.0,01:08.0,,,,,,
8326,17,2,T2 ,I will need to like exercise denominators and like (inaudible),,39:51.0,39:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8327,17,2,T2 ,,no,39:55.0,39:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8328,17,2,T2 ,that's a ninety-two that's not a twelve okay,,39:55.0,40:14.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
8329,17,2,T2 ,,well I thought it was a twelve,40:14.0,40:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8330,17,2,T2 ,I look at it like it was like a twelve,,40:19.0,40:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8331,17,2,T2 ,pause filler two hundred two that's supposed to be an o,,40:24.0,40:35.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8332,17,2,T2 ,and that's just nine x (sfx) right,,40:36.0,40:46.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8333,17,2,T2 ,okay I'm just going to say the hardest things to write are threes,,40:46.0,40:55.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8334,17,2,T2 ,if you try and squiggle it too fast it either is just going to end up as a straight line,,40:55.0,41:09.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
8335,17,2,T2 ,,,40:56.0,42:22.0,01:26.0,,,,,,
8336,17,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm so just want to x so you just brought up all along like x plus sixty equals nine x plus twenty-five,41:09.0,41:19.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8337,17,2,T2 ,,and then solve those for you and so not the fractions,41:19.0,41:25.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8338,17,2,T2 ,yeah no one likes looking at fractions which is like,,41:25.0,41:33.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8339,17,2,T2 ,if they're like easy like it's one fourth people (inaudible) to like point twenty-five,,41:33.0,42:02.0,00:29.0,,,,,,
8340,17,2,T2 ,,yeah I always do that,42:03.0,42:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,SD,
8341,17,2,T2 ,,I'd rather have decimal than fraction,42:07.0,42:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,SD,
8342,17,2,T2 ,mm-hmm thirty-five eight x graded slowly okay pause filler,,42:13.0,42:21.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8343,17,2,T2 ,,well I don't make it through this way,42:21.0,42:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8344,17,2,T2 ,,,42:22.0,43:50.0,01:28.0,,,,,,
8345,17,2,T2 ,(inaudible) okay I'm guessing this is supposed to be an equal sign not just a line,,42:25.0,42:40.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
8346,17,2,T2 ,,yeah that was looking better,42:40.0,42:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8347,17,2,T2 ,yummy yummy,,42:44.0,42:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8348,17,2,T2 ,what,,42:46.0,42:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8349,17,2,T2 ,,this is a one twenty-five,42:47.0,42:53.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8350,17,2,T2 ,yeah that's supposed to be a one twenty-five,,42:58.0,43:07.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8351,17,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),42:59.0,43:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8352,17,2,T2 ,just like this is the first (inaudible)  okay yeah jeez (inaudible),,43:07.0,43:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8353,17,2,T2 ,it doesn't actually matter which you subtract,,43:10.0,43:18.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8354,17,2,T2 ,it's just which is more easy,,43:19.0,43:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8355,17,2,T2 ,,yeah,43:24.0,43:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8356,17,2,T2 ,I mean I would prefer to have negative x than like negative one o three so,,43:24.0,43:36.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8357,17,2,T2 ,,same I'm for a negative three equals a negative number,43:36.0,43:41.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8358,17,2,T2 ,and yeah think of it as negative one times x or a negative x,,43:42.0,43:56.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
8359,17,2,T2 ,,,43:50.0,45:00.0,01:10.0,,,,,,
8360,17,2,T2 ,and so then you divide both by negative one,,44:01.0,44:08.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8361,17,2,T2 ,and then we have negative one over,,44:09.0,44:13.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8362,17,2,T2 ,,negative one o three equals x,44:14.0,44:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8363,17,2,T2 ,I think yeah it should be right,,44:17.0,44:21.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8364,17,2,T2 ,yeah I think that's right pause filler (sfx) scribbles everybody so hard to write,,44:21.0,44:38.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
8365,17,2,T2 ,okay so it's like probably the most the hardest thing here is what you're writing comes out like just a slight delay like here,,44:38.0,45:02.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
8366,17,2,T2 ,,,45:00.0,47:00.0,02:00.0,,,,,,
8367,17,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm yeah that's the only thing it's about this (inaudible),45:02.0,45:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8368,17,2,T2 ,,the running is different,45:08.0,45:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8369,17,2,T2 ,I'm trying to do that,,45:09.0,45:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8370,17,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),45:11.0,45:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8371,17,2,T2 ,pause filler so zero four carry the one,,45:12.0,45:17.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8372,17,2,T2 ,it's going to be yeah pause filler,,45:17.0,45:24.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8373,17,2,T2 ,that's yeah no (inaudible),,45:24.0,45:24.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8374,17,2,T2 ,,that's true too,45:27.0,45:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8375,17,2,T2 ,wait no wait what am I doing,,45:31.0,45:37.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8376,17,2,T2 ,that's (inaudible) is two forty,,45:37.0,45:43.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8377,17,2,T2 ,,uh-huh,45:43.0,45:44.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8378,17,2,T2 ,okay okay let's just say I thought this was like a three,,45:44.0,45:55.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8379,17,2,T2 ,so then it would be three twenty,,45:55.0,46:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8380,17,2,T2 ,there's a three forty,,46:01.0,46:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8381,17,2,T2 ,pause filler is it divisible by eleven,,46:06.0,46:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8382,17,2,T2 ,,I don't think so,46:10.0,46:14.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8383,17,2,T2 ,,it would be (inaudible),46:16.0,46:18.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8384,17,2,T2 ,,yeah I don't think it is,46:18.0,46:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8385,17,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),46:20.0,46:26.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8386,17,2,T2 ,there is an easy way to figure it out,,46:21.0,46:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8387,17,2,T2 ,pause filler (inaudible) okay okay so we have twenty-seven minus six x,,46:26.0,46:33.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8388,17,2,T2 ,where the six go (laughter) figure out yeah,,46:33.0,46:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8389,17,2,T2 ,(inaudible) oh my god so d now plus thirteen x this is a twenty,,46:37.0,46:44.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8390,17,2,T2 ,yeah this is a twenty-seven,,46:44.0,46:48.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8391,17,2,T2 ,,mm-hmm,46:48.0,46:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8392,17,2,T2 ,oh my gosh and we have six x plus thirty,,46:49.0,47:01.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8393,17,2,T2 ,okay thirty-six x I'm going to say this is a thirty-six,,47:01.0,47:11.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8394,17,2,T2 ,,,47:05.0,48:12.0,01:07.0,,,,,,
8395,17,2,T2 ,you can't say this is not,,47:11.0,47:12.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8396,17,2,T2 ,okay pause fillers then you have seven over thirty-six which is not a pretty number,,47:13.0,47:21.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8397,17,2,T2 ,,no it isn't (inaudible) x okay plus,47:21.0,47:31.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8398,17,2,T2 ,so we have seventy-three times x plus thirty-eight,,47:32.0,47:41.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8399,17,2,T2 ,and so here we can multiply seventy-three to x and thirty-eight,,47:42.0,47:51.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8400,17,2,T2 ,so we have seventy-three x plus whatever seventy-three times thirty-eight,,47:53.0,48:05.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8401,17,2,T2 ,is this is what happens (inaudible) for,,48:06.0,48:13.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8402,17,2,T2 ,,,48:12.0,51:26.0,03:14.0,,,,,,
8403,17,2,T2 ,pause filler that's twenty-four,,48:13.0,48:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8404,17,2,T2 ,that's fifty-six fifty-seven fifty-eight,,48:15.0,48:21.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8405,17,2,T2 ,that's seven yeah,,48:21.0,48:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8406,17,2,T2 ,that's seventy-three,,48:23.0,48:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8407,17,2,T2 ,so that's nine,,48:28.0,48:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8408,17,2,T2 ,and that's twenty-one,,48:30.0,48:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8409,17,2,T2 ,so we have four seven five two pause filler,,48:32.0,48:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8410,17,2,T2 ,,two times by a hundred seventy-four,48:36.0,48:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8411,17,2,T2 ,yeah and this equals negative two guys (laughter),,48:42.0,48:50.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8412,17,2,T2 ,pause filler and then so yeah seventy-three x equals two thousand five hundred and seventy-two,,48:50.0,49:01.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8413,17,2,T2 ,,seventy-two so this (inaudible),49:01.0,49:09.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8414,17,2,T2 ,now are (inaudible) (laughter),,49:10.0,49:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8415,17,2,T2 ,,two plus five is seven,49:12.0,49:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8416,17,2,T2 ,,seven seven is fourteen,49:16.0,49:23.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8417,17,2,T2 ,I'm going to try,,49:23.0,49:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8418,17,2,T2 ,I actually really hope neither did this well,,49:27.0,49:35.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8419,17,2,T2 ,because that would be cool but this,,49:37.0,49:46.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8420,17,2,T2 ,,so this is not,49:47.0,49:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8421,17,2,T2 ,pause filler let's try three,,49:51.0,50:07.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
8422,17,2,T2 ,so two hundred ninety that's a one thirty-eight three eight two,,50:08.0,50:26.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
8423,17,2,T2 ,pause filler that was actually very close,,50:26.0,50:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8424,17,2,T2 ,pause filler so yeah that was very close to being divisible,,50:31.0,50:40.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8425,17,2,T2 ,let's see if it was three hundred and sixty-five it would be divisible (laughter),,50:40.0,50:52.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8426,17,2,T2 ,lawn division is great okay,,50:52.0,50:59.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8427,17,2,T2 ,why am I getting the hard ones now (laughter),,50:59.0,51:22.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
8428,17,2,T2 ,oh yeah it used to be easy,,51:22.0,51:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8429,17,2,T2 ,,,51:26.0,53:06.0,01:40.0,,,,,,
8430,17,2,T2 ,mental math is great see fifteen,,51:26.0,51:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8431,17,2,T2 ,so that's minus fifteen,,51:29.0,51:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8432,17,2,T2 ,and that's nine plus fifteen,,51:34.0,51:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8433,17,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),51:39.0,51:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8434,17,2,T2 ,pause filler we have seventy-three equals one twenty-nine minus sixteen plus (inaudible),,51:39.0,51:47.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8435,17,2,T2 ,it's side and then one twenty-nine minus seventy-three,,51:47.0,51:56.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8436,17,2,T2 ,and we have six three,,51:56.0,52:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8437,17,2,T2 ,that's five fifty six,,52:00.0,52:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8438,17,2,T2 ,pause filler now the question pause filler so I have x equals fifty-six over sixteen,,52:03.0,52:16.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8439,17,2,T2 ,we can simplify that to fourteen over four yeah,,52:16.0,52:21.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8440,17,2,T2 ,and then that equals seven over two,,52:21.0,52:25.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8441,17,2,T2 ,so it was close to a whole number but not really,,52:25.0,52:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8442,17,2,T2 ,,(inaudible) to those,52:30.0,52:30.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8443,17,2,T2 ,oh okay let's do two ninety-five and then,,52:30.0,52:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8444,17,2,T2 ,,one is two fifteen minus one seventy-seven,52:34.0,52:42.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8445,17,2,T2 ,that is not,,52:42.0,52:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8446,17,2,T2 ,it's just two fifteen plus eighty,,52:44.0,52:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8447,17,2,T2 ,so that's two ninety-five,,52:48.0,52:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8448,17,2,T2 ,basically you want to simplify everything you can these are like,,52:49.0,52:56.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8449,17,2,T2 ,so you can just add those two,,52:57.0,52:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8450,17,2,T2 ,then it makes work a lot easier,,52:59.0,53:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8451,17,2,T2 ,,yeah,53:04.0,53:04.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8452,17,2,T2 ,you could go two eighty-five,,53:04.0,53:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8453,17,2,T2 ,,,53:07.0,56:48.0,03:41.0,,,,,,
8454,17,2,T2 ,let's try it okay pause filler,,53:08.0,53:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8455,17,2,T2 ,okay if I just turn off lines moving it might be better,,53:11.0,53:16.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8456,17,2,T2 ,pause filler so one seventy-seven is visible by three somehow,,53:16.0,53:23.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8457,17,2,T2 ,I don't exactly get how,,53:23.0,53:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,SD
8458,17,2,T2 ,pause filler so you have fifty-three,,53:26.0,53:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8459,17,2,T2 ,and then we have twenty-seven,,53:29.0,53:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8460,17,2,T2 ,so it's nine time three so fifty-nine,,53:32.0,53:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8461,17,2,T2 ,but two eighty-three is not,,53:37.0,53:41.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8462,17,2,T2 ,no I'm just moving it like this,,53:42.0,53:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8463,17,2,T2 ,you don't want to (inaudible) pause filler,,53:45.0,53:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8464,17,2,T2 ,,these are really hard,53:50.0,53:56.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8465,17,2,T2 ,at least it's not factoring,,53:59.0,54:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8466,17,2,T2 ,that's like all I have to say (laughter),,54:04.0,54:10.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8467,17,2,T2 ,pause filler yes forty-five x plus thirty equals twenty-eight plus thirty-three times twenty-six ninety-six plus sixty-four,,54:12.0,54:39.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
8468,17,2,T2 ,and we have negative eleven equals pause filler seventy-two ninety-two plus ninety-six minus forty-five so ninety-one fifty-one,,54:41.0,55:15.0,00:34.0,,,,,,
8469,17,2,T2 ,and then we subtract ninety-two,,55:19.0,55:26.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8470,17,2,T2 ,,(inaudible),55:19.0,55:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8471,17,2,T2 ,,okay,55:26.0,55:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8472,17,2,T2 ,,good,55:33.0,55:33.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8473,17,2,T2 ,all right I didn't actually finish this one,,56:04.0,56:10.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8474,17,2,T2 ,yeah (inaudible) matters I can just take this and (inaudible),,56:13.0,56:16.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8475,18,1,S1 ,,,00:36.0,06:25.0,05:49.0,,,,,,
8476,18,1,S1 ,,I'm turning to eighth,00:37.0,00:48.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8477,18,1,S1 ,oh same with me pause filler are you taking any languages,,00:49.0,00:59.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8478,18,1,S1 ,,pause filler yes German,01:01.0,01:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8479,18,1,S1 ,pause filler I was thinking about taking that,,01:04.0,01:39.0,00:35.0,,,,,,
8480,18,1,S1 ,but I'm taking Latin,,01:40.0,02:01.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
8481,18,1,S1 ,,and now (inaudible) stylus,02:05.0,02:09.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8482,18,1,S1 ,yeah oh forwards I'm heavy but backwards,,02:10.0,02:23.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8483,18,1,S1 ,I'm not what am I,,02:23.0,03:27.0,01:04.0,,,,,,
8484,18,1,S1 ,,(inaudible) do you know,03:27.0,03:50.0,00:23.0,,,,,,
8485,18,1,S1 ,no let me know if you want the answer,,03:50.0,03:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8486,18,1,S1 ,,I don't know the answer (inaudible) with riddles,03:53.0,04:23.0,00:30.0,,,,,,
8487,18,1,S1 ,(laughter) (inaudible),,03:53.0,03:58.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8488,18,1,S1 ,do you want to know the answer,,04:23.0,04:37.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
8489,18,1,S1 ,,yeah,04:37.0,04:38.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8490,18,1,S1 ,ton forwards I'm heavy but backwards I'm not,,04:38.0,04:44.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8491,18,1,S1 ,yeah,,04:45.0,04:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8492,18,1,S1 ,,it's like games we play,04:46.0,04:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8493,18,1,S1 ,,like you'd asked everybody that riddle (inaudible),04:51.0,05:00.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8494,18,1,S1 ,yeah it's so silly,,05:01.0,05:07.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8495,18,1,S1 ,,because it literally gives you the answer,05:07.0,05:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8496,18,1,S1 ,,yes it is like you most simply get complicated (inaudible),05:09.0,05:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8497,18,1,S1 ,like most people would get through the point of reversing the styling of the word,,05:14.0,05:21.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8498,18,1,S1 ,but then they'll think things like that's where it spells or not isn't a good example,,05:22.0,05:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8499,18,1,S1 ,I don't know anything that would make good example,,05:27.0,05:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8500,18,1,S1 ,but like one way they're thinking like one way to have the object the other way,,05:29.0,05:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8501,18,1,S1 ,it's a lightweight object,,05:33.0,05:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8502,18,1,S1 ,,naturally the problem,05:35.0,05:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8503,18,1,S1 ,can you still hear me,,06:49.0,06:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8504,18,1,S1 ,okay (sfx) (inaudible),,06:50.0,06:51.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8505,18,1,S1 ,,yes,06:51.0,06:51.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8506,18,1,S1 ,okay I don't know,,06:51.0,06:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8507,18,1,S1 ,like it's just that no speaker is detected,,06:52.0,06:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8508,18,1,S1 ,I was like oh like okay,,06:54.0,06:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8509,18,1,S1 ,so that's actually one period one,,06:55.0,06:56.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8510,18,1,S1 ,and you should be in green,,06:57.0,06:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8511,18,1,S1 ,because you are the,,06:58.0,07:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8512,18,1,S1 ,and make sure you guys are seeing the,,07:00.0,07:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8513,18,1,S1 ,you'll see him writing,,07:03.0,07:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8514,18,1,S1 ,and if anything seems wrong come out,,07:05.0,07:07.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8515,18,1,S1 ,and tell us okay,,07:07.0,07:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8516,18,1,S1 ,and this shouldn't be here (inaudible),,07:09.0,07:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8517,18,1,S1 ,okay you're writing in green,,07:12.0,07:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8518,18,1,S1 ,is that yours,,07:14.0,07:17.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8519,18,1,S1 ,,yup,07:17.0,07:17.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8520,18,1,S1 ,,okay so well first of all change all the equations,07:24.0,07:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8521,18,1,S1 ,,that's already right,07:28.0,07:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8522,18,1,S1 ,oh yes,,07:29.0,07:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8523,18,1,S1 ,oh are you doing anything,,07:30.0,07:34.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8524,18,1,S1 ,I can't see it,,07:34.0,07:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8525,18,1,S1 ,,it's just,07:38.0,07:44.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8526,18,1,S1 ,,something's not right in here yeah,07:56.0,08:06.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8527,18,1,S1 ,yeah,,08:06.0,08:07.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8528,18,1,S1 ,,okay (inaudible),08:07.0,08:07.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8529,18,1,S1 ,yup,,08:07.0,08:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8530,18,1,S1 ,,(inaudible) I got it,08:08.0,08:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8531,18,1,T1 ,,,08:13.0,28:15.0,20:02.0,,,,,,
8532,18,1,T1 ,,,08:13.0,28:15.0,20:02.0,,,,,,
8533,18,1,T1 ,okay I couldn't see what you're doing,,08:17.0,09:17.0,01:00.0,,,,,,
8534,18,1,T1 ,yeah what's up,,09:31.0,09:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8535,18,1,T1 ,pause filler I'm guessing you know pretty much how basic equations like this work,,09:34.0,09:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8536,18,1,T1 ,,yeah,09:40.0,09:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8537,18,1,T1 ,okay,,09:40.0,09:40.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8538,18,1,T1 ,,(inaudible) of this,09:40.0,09:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8539,18,1,T1 ,,and I don't know what is happening pause filler,09:41.0,09:46.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8540,18,1,T1 ,and then of course if you have a them as then,,09:48.0,10:00.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8541,18,1,T1 ,you're just doing it in the exact opposite order you would,,10:00.0,10:08.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8542,18,1,T1 ,addition and subtraction are technically the same thing,,10:08.0,10:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8543,18,1,T1 ,because subtracting you're just adding a negative,,10:11.0,10:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8544,18,1,T1 ,but let's say you have,,10:13.0,10:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8545,18,1,T1 ,in this case you have minus six,,10:15.0,10:16.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8546,18,1,T1 ,so you would add it with six,,10:16.0,10:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8547,18,1,T1 ,so you're doing it,,10:19.0,10:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8548,18,1,T1 ,except with the inverse all the things and in the opposite order and then like if I have different,,10:21.0,10:26.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8549,18,1,T1 ,addition and subtraction are technically the same thing same with multiplication and division dividing it and multiplying by fraction and then oh yeah,,10:26.0,10:35.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8550,18,1,T1 ,so you know if you have like five y plus four equals twenty-four,,10:36.0,10:50.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
8551,18,1,T1 ,I know I have a terrible handwriting but anything like a,,10:50.0,10:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8552,18,1,T1 ,you work for this backwards,,10:54.0,10:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8553,18,1,T1 ,and you have the inverse operations pause filler same with exponents with the logarithms,,10:56.0,11:05.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8554,18,1,T1 ,I'm not quite sure how that works,,11:05.0,11:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8555,18,1,T1 ,so I can't find that here,,11:08.0,11:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8556,18,1,T1 ,and then find just exactly what you think even if you have two x plus,,11:12.0,11:21.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8557,18,1,T1 ,I'll put pause filler four okay plus three x equals x,,11:22.0,11:35.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8558,18,1,T1 ,you can't take care best until you've taken care of best,,11:35.0,11:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8559,18,1,T1 ,so do you know what you do in this situation,,11:39.0,11:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8560,18,1,T1 ,why don't you rewrite it,,11:41.0,11:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8561,18,1,T1 ,I probably actually I can probably play,,11:44.0,11:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8562,18,1,T1 ,so if you have,,11:54.0,11:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8563,18,1,T1 ,I know you can probably write better but two x plus four in parenthesis plus three x equals x,,11:54.0,12:11.0,00:17.0,,,LPA,,,
8564,18,1,T1 ,do you know what you do in this situation,,12:11.0,12:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8565,18,1,T1 ,,you do the parenthesis last,12:14.0,12:18.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8566,18,1,T1 ,so yes you have to do the parenthesis last to write your,,12:19.0,12:24.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8567,18,1,T1 ,I mean there are technically two ways of answering this,,12:26.0,12:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8568,18,1,T1 ,but one is a lot,,12:30.0,12:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8569,18,1,T1 ,you feel (inaudible) plus four,,12:32.0,12:35.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8570,18,1,T1 ,you could technically divide by five for what you'd be doing if you have y plus four fifth,,12:35.0,12:44.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8571,18,1,T1 ,because what you're doing is you're multiplying all this entire side by one fifth,,12:45.0,12:49.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8572,18,1,T1 ,and then you'd have twenty-four over five whatever the heck that is,,12:50.0,12:55.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8573,18,1,T1 ,and it's a lot easier if you just subtract four first into your,,12:55.0,12:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8574,18,1,T1 ,it's the same thing if,,12:59.0,13:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8575,18,1,T1 ,you could've technically multiply with his back here,,13:01.0,13:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8576,18,1,T1 ,but it's much easier to subtract,,13:05.0,13:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8577,18,1,T1 ,so can you try to solve this one through,,13:09.0,13:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8578,18,1,T1 ,,yeah (inaudible),13:19.0,13:19.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8579,18,1,T1 ,pause filler there's a same for the fifth bottom one easier (inaudible),,13:21.0,13:32.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8580,18,1,T1 ,,you just click,13:32.0,13:39.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8581,18,1,T1 ,what,,13:39.0,13:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8582,18,1,T1 ,,you need to write,13:40.0,13:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8583,18,1,T1 ,yeah,,14:06.0,14:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8584,18,1,T1 ,,okay,14:29.0,14:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8585,18,1,T1 ,pause filler are you writing or,,14:30.0,14:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8586,18,1,T1 ,,no I'm thinking,14:32.0,14:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8587,18,1,T1 ,okay I just wanted to make sure,,14:34.0,14:55.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
8588,18,1,T1 ,so you know how subtracting coefficient works like x minus three x,,14:59.0,15:08.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8589,18,1,T1 ,because you need to deal with this term first no,,15:08.0,15:12.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8590,18,1,T1 ,,maybe I'm sorry my writing,15:18.0,15:28.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8591,18,1,T1 ,,it's just not working,15:28.0,15:34.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8592,18,1,T1 ,so let me know if you don't know any of these,,15:41.0,15:49.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8593,18,1,T1 ,and if the problem you'll need subtracting coefficients pause filler negative if numbers and then simple,,15:49.0,15:59.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8594,18,1,T1 ,pause filler division I believe simple that and problem solving,,16:00.0,16:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8595,18,1,T1 ,we're subtracting sides that being don't,,16:05.0,16:16.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8596,18,1,T1 ,so if you don't know how to do it that's perfectly fine,,16:16.0,16:37.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
8597,18,1,T1 ,,yeah yes,16:38.0,16:41.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8598,18,1,T1 ,okay so I'm going to like some let me this,,16:44.0,16:54.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8599,18,1,T1 ,start with the simpler problems that are basically,,16:55.0,16:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8600,18,1,T1 ,show the pieces of this,,16:58.0,17:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8601,18,1,T1 ,,on that problem you were saying like four over five something like that,17:00.0,17:08.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8602,18,1,T1 ,,where is the five coming from,17:08.0,17:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8603,18,1,T1 ,in this one,,17:10.0,17:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8604,18,1,T1 ,,pause filler no the ones that were down here,17:12.0,17:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8605,18,1,T1 ,okay yeah sorry I was talking about this one not that one,,17:15.0,17:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8606,18,1,T1 ,,oh okay,17:21.0,17:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8607,18,1,T1 ,that one if this one you could divide it by five,,17:23.0,17:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8608,18,1,T1 ,it's a lot simpler if you just subtract four first,,17:27.0,17:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8609,18,1,T1 ,because you end up with y plus four over five is equals twenty-four over five,,17:30.0,17:36.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8610,18,1,T1 ,which I don't want to go for that,,17:37.0,17:42.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8611,18,1,T1 ,okay pause filler the same basic so let me see,,17:44.0,17:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8612,18,1,T1 ,you just know how to solve this two sides okay of an equation with variables on two sides like this,,17:50.0,17:59.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8613,18,1,T1 ,,I don't,17:59.0,17:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8614,18,1,T1 ,,I have done the same,18:02.0,18:15.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8615,18,1,T1 ,,I just can't remember,18:15.0,18:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8616,18,1,T1 ,okay then what you do with pause filler you could subtract either x or sort of react in something like this,,18:20.0,18:28.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8617,18,1,T1 ,it doesn't really matter,,18:28.0,18:29.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8618,18,1,T1 ,it's easier to do with the pause filler smaller one,,18:29.0,18:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8619,18,1,T1 ,because it keeps the coefficient positive,,18:33.0,18:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8620,18,1,T1 ,so I'd say,,18:36.0,18:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8621,18,1,T1 ,I would subtract x from both sides,,18:36.0,18:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8622,18,1,T1 ,we'd end up with two x equals zero,,18:40.0,18:44.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8623,18,1,T1 ,now this becomes a solvable problem right quite simple,,18:44.0,18:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8624,18,1,T1 ,,what do you mean x besides that like yeah,18:49.0,18:59.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8625,18,1,T1 ,yeah,,19:01.0,19:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8626,18,1,T1 ,,I want to say,19:02.0,19:07.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8627,18,1,T1 ,so then do you know basic negative numbers like how to get four minus seven,,19:07.0,19:17.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8628,18,1,T1 ,,oops sorry,19:19.0,19:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8629,18,1,T1 ,pause filler for minus seven,,19:21.0,19:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8630,18,1,T1 ,,yeah that'll be minus three,19:24.0,19:34.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8631,18,1,T1 ,yup so then we can have a problem like x plus seven equals four,,19:35.0,19:48.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8632,18,1,T1 ,and we got to subtract,,19:49.0,19:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8633,18,1,T1 ,so you already know that we subtract first that negative for like,,19:51.0,19:56.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8634,18,1,T1 ,and then if we were to,,19:56.0,19:58.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8635,18,1,T1 ,we can make this,,19:58.0,19:58.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8636,18,1,T1 ,do you know like decimals slash fractions,,19:59.0,20:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8637,18,1,T1 ,where I would have two x plus seven equals four,,20:01.0,20:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8638,18,1,T1 ,,how are they related,20:06.0,20:12.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8639,18,1,T1 ,so it's two times x,,20:13.0,20:15.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8640,18,1,T1 ,that's what it is,,20:16.0,20:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8641,18,1,T1 ,if you don't have anything between a number and a variable,,20:16.0,20:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8642,18,1,T1 ,it means they're being multiplied plus x,,20:19.0,20:21.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8643,18,1,T1 ,I mean equals four,,20:21.0,20:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8644,18,1,T1 ,can you solve this for me,,20:23.0,20:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8645,18,1,T1 ,,oh yeah you're talking about decimals and something like that,20:25.0,20:29.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8646,18,1,T1 ,yeah you'll see,,20:29.0,20:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8647,18,1,T1 ,,okay wait what is subtracting,20:35.0,20:43.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8648,18,1,T1 ,,can you describe them,20:43.0,20:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8649,18,1,T1 ,so,,20:48.0,20:48.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8650,18,1,T1 ,,this would be x,20:49.0,20:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8651,18,1,T1 ,,and there's a negative,20:52.0,20:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8652,18,1,T1 ,yeah so yeah so can you just like solve this from the beginning for me,,20:54.0,21:21.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
8653,18,1,T1 ,,yes,21:22.0,21:22.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8654,18,1,T1 ,write out like you're doing to solve it wait so,,21:26.0,21:59.0,00:33.0,,,,,,
8655,18,1,T1 ,so I don't know if you just wrote that wrong,,22:02.0,22:11.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8656,18,1,T1 ,but I'd like you to keep going,,22:11.0,22:19.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8657,18,1,T1 ,if I can write on here so,,22:19.0,22:49.0,00:30.0,,,,,,
8658,18,1,T1 ,,yeah it sounds like it's really hard to write into,22:55.0,23:40.0,00:45.0,,,,,,
8659,18,1,T1 ,so,,23:44.0,23:44.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8660,18,1,T1 ,,(inaudible) that I'm trying to find x,23:45.0,23:55.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8661,18,1,T1 ,yeah,,23:56.0,23:56.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8662,18,1,T1 ,,okay okay,23:57.0,23:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8663,18,1,T1 ,do you know how multiplication and division with negative four works,,23:59.0,24:06.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8664,18,1,T1 ,,yeah sort of,24:06.0,24:26.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
8665,18,1,T1 ,okay,,24:35.0,24:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8666,18,1,T1 ,,is that right,24:42.0,24:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8667,18,1,T1 ,no so do you not know what to do when you have a coefficient on the variable equal something,,24:47.0,24:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8668,18,1,T1 ,so here we have two times x equals negative three,,24:56.0,25:02.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8669,18,1,T1 ,so what we would do is,,25:02.0,25:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8670,18,1,T1 ,we divide both sides by two,,25:04.0,25:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8671,18,1,T1 ,,okay,25:07.0,25:08.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8672,18,1,T1 ,so it's not negative six but negative one point five,,25:09.0,25:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8673,18,1,T1 ,have three and negative three divided by two is equal to two negative one point five,,25:15.0,25:32.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
8674,18,1,T1 ,so okay so actually with that do you know how (inaudible) like,,25:32.0,25:41.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8675,18,1,T1 ,if you have two x two times a quantity x plus one,,25:41.0,26:00.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
8676,18,1,T1 ,,oh yes,26:00.0,26:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8677,18,1,S2 ,,,29:14.0,34:46.0,05:32.0,,,,,,
8678,18,1,S2 ,thank you,,29:27.0,29:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8679,18,1,S2 ,(inaudible),,30:05.0,30:05.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8680,18,1,S2 ,(inaudible) and we don't know for bringing the distributive property there too though,,30:05.0,30:32.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
8681,18,1,S2 ,,I'm assuming about this time,30:34.0,30:41.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8682,18,1,S2 ,,so I'm just going to have to get that,30:42.0,31:07.0,00:25.0,,,,,,
8683,18,1,S2 ,,it's almost like a (inaudible),31:09.0,31:18.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8684,18,1,S2 ,,here you go,31:33.0,31:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8685,18,1,S2 ,,can I see what's that,34:07.0,34:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8686,18,1,S2 ,,can I see the worksheet,34:14.0,34:20.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8687,18,1,S2 ,yeah,,34:20.0,34:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8688,18,1,S2 ,,oh look okay cool,34:20.0,34:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8689,18,1,S2 ,looks like they were (inaudible),,34:23.0,34:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8690,18,1,S2 ,,it's a little oh,34:24.0,34:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8691,18,1,S2 ,okay,,34:26.0,34:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8692,18,1,S2 ,,(inaudible) like the end here,34:26.0,34:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8693,18,1,S2 ,pause filler it's twenty-five in total two five,,34:29.0,34:36.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8694,18,1,S2 ,,all right we need to see this,34:36.0,34:54.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
8695,18,1,S2 ,,it's okay if I don't catch the instructions,34:56.0,35:14.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
8696,18,1,S2 ,,I'll just make sure,35:16.0,35:31.0,00:15.0,,,,,,
8697,18,1,S2 ,,pause filler I like this,35:31.0,35:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8698,18,1,S2 ,pause filler (inaudible) the server it's been a long time (inaudible),,35:33.0,35:44.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8699,18,1,S2 ,oh that's three times negative one equals negative four,,35:50.0,36:01.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8700,18,1,S2 ,,(inaudible) guys,36:01.0,36:04.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8701,18,1,S2 ,yeah we'll keep with the negative four,,36:04.0,36:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8702,18,1,T2 ,,,36:06.0,56:04.0,19:58.0,,,,,,
8703,18,1,T2 ,,,36:06.0,38:00.0,01:54.0,,,,,,
8704,18,1,T2 ,,I'm pretty sure (inaudible) writing,36:09.0,36:16.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8705,18,1,T2 ,it is pause filler,,36:16.0,36:21.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8706,18,1,T2 ,so it would be,,36:21.0,36:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8707,18,1,T2 ,any way I need to check on my work,,36:22.0,36:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8708,18,1,T2 ,we subtract,,36:24.0,36:25.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8709,18,1,T2 ,oh you're right,,36:25.0,36:26.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8710,18,1,T2 ,it's negative five sorry,,36:26.0,36:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8711,18,1,T2 ,twenty-three minus eighteen is five negative five,,36:28.0,36:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8712,18,1,T2 ,,I mean it should be,36:33.0,36:39.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8713,18,1,T2 ,so let me make sure,,36:40.0,36:45.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8714,18,1,T2 ,,I don't (inaudible) it's strange,36:47.0,36:55.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8715,18,1,T2 ,pause filler on the back of anything that (inaudible) we got to make sure,,36:56.0,37:15.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
8716,18,1,T2 ,so if we were to subtract eighteen from both sides,,37:21.0,37:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8717,18,1,T2 ,that's what we do first,,37:26.0,37:27.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8718,18,1,T2 ,we got the opposite of y equals five right,,37:30.0,37:39.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8719,18,1,T2 ,,you're almost right,37:39.0,37:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8720,18,1,T2 ,oh,,37:41.0,37:41.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8721,18,1,T2 ,,so I'm getting a negative five,37:41.0,37:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8722,18,1,T2 ,yeah we still have the opposite of y equals five,,37:44.0,37:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8723,18,1,T2 ,,wait oh negative oh is that the same,37:47.0,37:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8724,18,1,T2 ,,I guess,37:50.0,37:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8725,18,1,T2 ,so we multiply by negative one,,37:50.0,37:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8726,18,1,T2 ,and we got y equals negative five,,37:55.0,37:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8727,18,1,T2 ,which is I have here you know,,37:58.0,38:01.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8728,18,1,T2 ,,oh okay okay you're right then,38:01.0,38:12.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8729,18,1,T2 ,,,38:01.0,41:54.0,03:53.0,,,,,,
8730,18,1,T2 ,okay,,38:13.0,38:13.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8731,18,1,T2 ,,and are we doing questions (inaudible),38:15.0,38:24.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8732,18,1,T2 ,,I feel like (inaudible),38:24.0,38:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8733,18,1,T2 ,oh okay pause filler (inaudible) pause filler interesting so I believe the packet have a purpose of the variable first,,38:27.0,38:34.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8734,18,1,T2 ,I don't need to do that,,38:34.0,38:35.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8735,18,1,T2 ,I thought I will,,38:35.0,38:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8736,18,1,T2 ,pause filler there are multiple ways to do this because math,,38:37.0,38:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8737,18,1,T2 ,it's a free country,,38:40.0,38:42.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8738,18,1,T2 ,the packet might do it in different ways but,,38:45.0,38:52.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8739,18,1,T2 ,pause filler so like that ignore best I subtract k from both sides,,38:53.0,38:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8740,18,1,T2 ,negative two k minus fourteen equals thirty-six,,38:57.0,39:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8741,18,1,T2 ,add eighteen plus five negative two k equals,,39:04.0,39:12.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8742,18,1,T2 ,,I'm not sure it's actually on the packet,39:12.0,39:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8743,18,1,T2 ,what,,39:16.0,39:17.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8744,18,1,T2 ,,I'm not sure it's actually on the packet,39:17.0,39:22.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8745,18,1,T2 ,oh yeah pause filler I think they should step to make sure that everything was right beforehand okay,,39:22.0,39:28.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8746,18,1,T2 ,,yeah on the packet there was,39:29.0,39:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8747,18,1,T2 ,the cake would be equal to negative twenty-five,,39:32.0,39:38.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8748,18,1,T2 ,this should be right twenty-five minus fourteen,,39:40.0,39:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8749,18,1,T2 ,it's a eleven thirty-six plus or negative twenty-five (inaudible) or but then (inaudible) well definitely it sorry,,39:44.0,39:56.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8750,18,1,T2 ,this side totally breaks out to eleven thirty-six plus twenty so thirty-six minus twenty-five if the value wake out to eleven,,39:57.0,40:07.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8751,18,1,T2 ,if we tell the stack again yeah eleven equals eleven,,40:07.0,40:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8752,18,1,T2 ,so this is right,,40:11.0,40:23.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8753,18,1,T2 ,,right okay okay yeah,40:23.0,40:34.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8754,18,1,T2 ,pause filler so I can subtract k from both sides,,40:34.0,41:05.0,00:31.0,,,,,,
8755,18,1,T2 ,,(inaudible) okay,41:05.0,41:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8756,18,1,T2 ,I just cracked it from both sides but then that negative k minus k negative two k so maybe two k minus fourteen thirty-six negative two k so that's what (inaudible),,41:08.0,42:30.0,01:22.0,,,,,,
8757,18,1,T2 ,,,41:54.0,47:38.0,05:44.0,,,,,,
8758,18,1,T2 ,thirty-six so make them,,42:32.0,42:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8759,18,1,T2 ,,I know twenty-two,42:37.0,42:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8760,18,1,T2 ,,I know like this an arrow by needle,42:39.0,42:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8761,18,1,T2 ,so you're adding k to both sides,,42:42.0,42:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8762,18,1,T2 ,if that should still be right,,42:45.0,42:46.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8763,18,1,T2 ,negative fourteen equals thirty-six plus two k,,42:47.0,42:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8764,18,1,T2 ,,and then subtracting thirty-six from both sides,42:49.0,42:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8765,18,1,T2 ,(inaudible),,42:51.0,42:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8766,18,1,T2 ,okay subtracting thirty-six that,,42:52.0,42:55.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8767,18,1,T2 ,,thirty-six are not negative twenty-two,42:55.0,42:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8768,18,1,T2 ,that this is negative fourteen,,42:58.0,43:03.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8769,18,1,T2 ,,oh,43:03.0,43:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8770,18,1,T2 ,pause filler minus thirty-six is negative fifty divided by two to negative twenty-five,,43:04.0,43:09.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8771,18,1,T2 ,,okay that makes sense,43:10.0,43:20.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8772,18,1,T2 ,so yeah I don't know if eight is terrible,,43:21.0,43:35.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
8773,18,1,T2 ,I can okay,,43:35.0,43:39.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8774,18,1,T2 ,pause filler I can,,43:39.0,43:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8775,18,1,T2 ,let's say if I would subtract p from both sides,,43:42.0,43:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8776,18,1,T2 ,I get seventeen minus two b equals thirteen minus thirty,,43:46.0,43:57.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8777,18,1,T2 ,actually let's subtract seventeen,,43:58.0,44:05.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8778,18,1,T2 ,that would make more sense negative two oh (inaudible) pause filler negative two yeah,,44:06.0,44:13.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8779,18,1,T2 ,negative two b equals negative four divided by negative two,,44:13.0,44:23.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8780,18,1,T2 ,yup b equals two,,44:23.0,44:27.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8781,18,1,T2 ,,it proves like,44:29.0,44:37.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8782,18,1,T2 ,,where did you get rid of things given you,44:39.0,45:07.0,00:28.0,,,,,,
8783,18,1,T2 ,pause filler so in the first step I subtracted b from this side,,45:07.0,45:14.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8784,18,1,T2 ,so this is a,,45:14.0,45:15.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8785,18,1,T2 ,I'm trying to write it down,,45:15.0,45:17.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8786,18,1,T2 ,this next part is seventeen minus two b,,45:17.0,45:20.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8787,18,1,T2 ,,oh oh okay okay,45:20.0,45:23.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8788,18,1,T2 ,thirteen then we subtracted seventeen to both sides yeah (inaudible) that out in that negative two b equals negative four b equals five divided five by negative two equals two yeah five partial (inaudible),,45:23.0,46:03.0,00:40.0,,,,,,
8789,18,1,T2 ,,okay,46:04.0,46:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8790,18,1,T2 ,divide both sides by negative nine,,46:08.0,46:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8791,18,1,T2 ,g equals negative nine,,46:12.0,46:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8792,18,1,T2 ,subtract ten from both sides,,46:15.0,46:32.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
8793,18,1,T2 ,seventy-two equals negative eight y or divided by five by negative eight,,46:34.0,46:43.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8794,18,1,T2 ,and divide negative equal two like,,46:48.0,46:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8795,18,1,T2 ,but that's an equal sign negative nine so (inaudible) here,,46:51.0,47:21.0,00:30.0,,,,,,
8796,18,1,T2 ,I don't know why that (inaudible) like that's,,47:21.0,47:30.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8797,18,1,T2 ,add sixty-five to both sides twenty-six oh (inaudible) twenty-five,,47:31.0,47:41.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8798,18,1,T2 ,I'm sorry,,47:41.0,47:42.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8799,18,1,T2 ,subtract sixty-five minus sixty-five minus,,47:42.0,47:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8800,18,1,T2 ,pause filler that would be one hundred to my sixty one hundred minus fifty-eight ninety-two minus,,47:49.0,48:00.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
8801,18,1,T2 ,,,47:54.0,50:46.0,02:52.0,,,,,,
8802,18,1,T2 ,that would be forty-eight equals negative fourteen,,48:03.0,48:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8803,18,1,T2 ,pause filler that doesn't quite (inaudible),,48:08.0,48:17.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8804,18,1,T2 ,pause filler so four divide both sides by negative fourteen (inaudible) equals two,,48:17.0,48:24.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8805,18,1,T2 ,let me work this out,,48:25.0,48:28.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8806,18,1,T2 ,forty-eight okay equals twenty-four over seven twenty-four,,48:29.0,48:41.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8807,18,1,T2 ,that's it as far as I can do with it negative,,48:42.0,48:45.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8808,18,1,T2 ,but I like to rate it as a next number three negative three and three yeah three times negative three and thirty-seven,,48:46.0,48:59.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8809,18,1,T2 ,,can I tell you something,49:00.0,49:03.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8810,18,1,T2 ,what,,49:03.0,49:04.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8811,18,1,T2 ,,you are a half genius (inaudible),49:04.0,49:06.0,00:02.0,,,LPA,,,
8812,18,1,T2 ,I know,,49:06.0,49:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8813,18,1,T2 ,add forty-one to both sides,,49:06.0,49:22.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
8814,18,1,T2 ,seventy-five equals nine end up really,,49:22.0,49:29.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8815,18,1,T2 ,the thing is when you actually are able to understand the operations you're doing,,49:29.0,49:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8816,18,1,T2 ,you realize there are so many different ways things can be done,,49:33.0,49:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8817,18,1,T2 ,tell me when you divide both sides by negative nine right now (inaudible),,49:36.0,49:45.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8818,18,1,T2 ,pause filler nine times eight is seventy-two,,49:46.0,49:51.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8819,18,1,T2 ,so k equal to eight and three-ninths which are due to one or,,49:51.0,50:01.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8820,18,1,T2 ,pause filler did I yeah oh that would be negative negative eight and one third,,50:03.0,50:20.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
8821,18,1,T2 ,,okay,50:21.0,50:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8822,18,1,T2 ,pause filler hi add p to both sides,,50:22.0,50:31.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8823,18,1,T2 ,fifty-two equals nine p minus everything,,50:32.0,50:42.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8824,18,1,T2 ,I like my number because these numbers are,,50:42.0,50:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8825,18,1,T2 ,,,50:46.0,51:15.0,00:29.0,,,,,,
8826,18,1,T2 ,yeah add fifty-two to both sides,,50:48.0,50:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8827,18,1,T2 ,bye,,51:12.0,51:12.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8828,18,1,T2 ,,yay,51:12.0,51:12.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8829,18,1,T2 ,,,51:15.0,52:20.0,01:05.0,,,,,,
8830,18,1,T2 ,,,52:20.0,54:18.0,01:58.0,,,,,,
8831,18,1,T2 ,,,54:19.0,55:17.0,00:58.0,,,,,,
8832,18,1,T2 ,,,55:25.0,56:04.0,00:39.0,,,,,,
8833,18,2,S1 ,,,01:10.0,07:52.0,06:42.0,,,,,,
8834,18,2,S1 ,,so let's hear your least favorite color,01:21.0,01:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8835,18,2,S1 ,pause filler least favorite color I don't know,,01:23.0,01:32.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8836,18,2,S1 ,,at least mine is like a bright bright bright bright green like greenish with like a lot of white,01:34.0,01:40.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8837,18,2,S1 ,,but it just looks kind of like I don't know,01:40.0,01:45.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8838,18,2,S1 ,,it's just like it feels like the kind of thing that (inaudible) with anything,01:45.0,02:22.0,00:37.0,,,,,,
8839,18,2,S1 ,(inaudible) and for my final project I'm trying to code something really weird,,02:22.0,02:25.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8840,18,2,S1 ,it's a variant of chess where spectators decide how to be (inaudible) but don't tell the players how they move,,02:26.0,02:34.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8841,18,2,S1 ,,so it's like chess except the players need to,02:34.0,02:43.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8842,18,2,S1 ,,the players only sometimes get to move,02:43.0,02:45.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8843,18,2,S1 ,yeah the players need to figure out how to move,,02:45.0,02:47.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8844,18,2,S1 ,pause filler in some variant players get to keep trying and want to make a move and others,,02:48.0,02:53.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8845,18,2,S1 ,if they're making a link the one that goes to the max players (inaudible),,02:53.0,02:57.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8846,18,2,S1 ,,oh okay so the spectators they just choose how the pieces move,02:57.0,03:02.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8847,18,2,S1 ,yeah,,03:02.0,03:03.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8848,18,2,S1 ,,oh that will be fun,03:04.0,03:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8849,18,2,S1 ,yeah I found it on Wikipedia it's called Penultima,,03:07.0,03:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8850,18,2,S1 ,,it's like next-level chess or,03:09.0,03:16.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8851,18,2,S1 ,yeah I'm probably going to have it be played in two different ways one where you input the pause filler how the pieces move and then the computer to find different moves (inaudible) and then one where (inaudible) the spectators,,03:17.0,03:30.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8852,18,2,S1 ,because in the first one the moves are more restrictive,,03:31.0,03:35.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8853,18,2,S1 ,but there will be no mistakes or cheating to the spectators,,03:35.0,03:40.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8854,18,2,S1 ,in the second one you have that human element,,03:40.0,03:43.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8855,18,2,S1 ,but it doesn't allow for more creative rules,,03:44.0,03:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8856,18,2,S1 ,,yeah well I mean like maybe only having one spectator because,03:47.0,03:54.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8857,18,2,S1 ,,and like there could be other spectators but only one that decides,03:55.0,03:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8858,18,2,S1 ,,because you know if you know that one because,04:00.0,04:05.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8859,18,2,S1 ,yeah,,04:06.0,04:06.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8860,18,2,S1 ,,like if (inaudible) with one person you know makes it really a part base field to move,04:06.0,04:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8861,18,2,S1 ,,the other person will also have that,04:11.0,04:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8862,18,2,S1 ,yeah,,04:15.0,04:15.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8863,18,2,S1 ,,so yeah,04:15.0,04:15.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8864,18,2,S1 ,so generally if I have multiple spectators before the game begins when I talk about how the pieces will be moving,,04:17.0,04:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8865,18,2,S1 ,,yeah well yeah that's just neat,04:23.0,04:29.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8866,18,2,S1 ,yeah the thing that where the computer are (inaudible),,04:30.0,04:37.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8867,18,2,S1 ,the thing that actually makes up possible to code is the fact that you can't have the rules be too complicated,,04:38.0,04:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8868,18,2,S1 ,because then the players will never figure them out,,04:46.0,04:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8869,18,2,S1 ,,well I mean something else you could run into is the computer having a new set of rules for each of move,04:48.0,05:01.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8870,18,2,S1 ,yeah pause filler I haven't done Macs yet,,05:01.0,05:03.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8871,18,2,S1 ,I haven't even coding it maybe about an hour but pause filler right now I have had,,05:03.0,05:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8872,18,2,S1 ,I'm not rendering (inaudible) anything yet,,05:08.0,05:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8873,18,2,S1 ,but I have a to-do list so a list of lists where it's eight by eight,,05:10.0,05:16.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8874,18,2,S1 ,and then it just have letters for the pieces pause filler lower case all for the black row and upper case long for the white,,05:16.0,05:23.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8875,18,2,S1 ,then it has the two letter of four light and king,,05:23.0,05:28.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8876,18,2,S1 ,,so you couldn't make it,05:28.0,05:31.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8877,18,2,S1 ,,so there's like only a certain amount of pieces,05:31.0,05:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8878,18,2,S1 ,,the moves can be changed to make it so like not like,05:34.0,05:38.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8879,18,2,S1 ,,because if it was different you would need to figure it out and remember it for each piece,05:38.0,05:44.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8880,18,2,S1 ,,I mean we're having a list though,05:46.0,05:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8881,18,2,S1 ,yeah like the rook couldn't move in one way,,05:48.0,05:51.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8882,18,2,S1 ,the (inaudible) sort of move in a different way,,05:51.0,05:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8883,18,2,S1 ,but like sometimes they can change when they're being captured or capturing the piece like how a pawn moves diagonally if it's capturing a piece then,,05:54.0,06:02.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8884,18,2,S1 ,pause filler also there's also something weird in Penultima called invoking of piece where a piece can affect another piece on the board without actually moving,,06:02.0,06:12.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8885,18,2,S1 ,so it's kind of so it makes so even if the piece itself is weak it increases its strategic importance,,06:14.0,06:21.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8886,18,2,S1 ,kind of like how the king is arguably the weakest piece in the game and yet also the most important,,06:21.0,06:28.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8887,18,2,S1 ,,well actually I have found it,06:29.0,06:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8888,18,2,S1 ,,if like the person doesn't have many pieces that are very good at capturing king the king can like,06:30.0,06:39.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8889,18,2,S1 ,,because the king can't die,06:39.0,06:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8890,18,2,S1 ,,so it's like if you only have really pawns left you know maybe a bishop or two,06:42.0,06:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8891,18,2,S1 ,,like the king can't just go up and kill them,06:46.0,06:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8892,18,2,S1 ,,because the king can't die,06:48.0,06:50.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8893,18,2,S1 ,that's because by the rules the game you're not allowed to put the position in the king into a position where he could,,06:50.0,06:56.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8894,18,2,S1 ,,yeah so that kind of means that (inaudible) (laughter),06:57.0,07:01.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8895,18,2,S1 ,but like the car is definitively more powerful,,07:03.0,07:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8896,18,2,S1 ,because it can move to every place,,07:07.0,07:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8897,18,2,S1 ,it freaking can,,07:10.0,07:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8898,18,2,S1 ,it can move (inaudible) where it can be killed and if it is killed,,07:11.0,07:16.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8899,18,2,S1 ,,because you know like regardless of the king,07:16.0,07:21.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8900,18,2,S1 ,,the king can't technically die unless,07:21.0,07:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8901,18,2,S1 ,,and if it does then the game is lost so,07:24.0,07:30.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8902,18,2,S1 ,yeah checkmate if you (inaudible),,07:30.0,07:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8903,18,2,S1 ,,but that's very difficult (inaudible),07:32.0,07:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8904,18,2,S1 ,,so when like because like I think rooks are one of the best pieces for doing checkmate,07:36.0,07:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8905,18,2,S1 ,yeah that and knights,,07:42.0,07:46.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8906,18,2,S1 ,,yeah so it's like they,07:46.0,07:50.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8907,18,2,S1 ,,time,07:51.0,07:52.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8908,18,2,S1 ,,pause filler do you see the problems wherever seven actually goes forty,08:15.0,08:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8909,18,2,S1 ,yeah,,08:20.0,08:20.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8910,18,2,S1 ,,okay he does,08:21.0,08:21.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8911,18,2,T1 ,,,08:58.0,29:36.0,20:38.0,,,,,,
8912,18,2,T1 ,,,08:58.0,19:01.0,10:03.0,,,,,,
8913,18,2,T1 ,,okay,09:32.0,09:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8914,18,2,T1 ,okay pause filler can you solve this problem here or at least the (inaudible),,09:32.0,10:21.0,00:49.0,,,,,,
8915,18,2,T1 ,,I realize now the (inaudible) people work at the back,10:21.0,10:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8916,18,2,T1 ,yes that would make fun,,10:30.0,10:31.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8917,18,2,T1 ,,is that right,10:31.0,10:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8918,18,2,T1 ,pause filler no I don't believe so,,10:33.0,10:35.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8919,18,2,T1 ,,no,10:35.0,10:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8920,18,2,T1 ,pause filler no it isn't pause filler (inaudible),,10:35.0,10:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8921,18,2,T1 ,,oh,10:37.0,10:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8922,18,2,T1 ,pause filler so pause filler do you remember what to do when you have pause filler multiplication on the variable,,10:37.0,10:46.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
8923,18,2,T1 ,,multiplication,10:52.0,10:52.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8924,18,2,T1 ,so this is three sevenths times x,,10:53.0,10:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8925,18,2,T1 ,,oh oh times oh yeah okay wait divide,10:56.0,11:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8926,18,2,T1 ,,should I need to add x to both sides divide it,11:03.0,11:23.0,00:20.0,,,,,,
8927,18,2,T1 ,pause filler so you want to isolate x,,11:23.0,11:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8928,18,2,T1 ,I'm sorry,,11:26.0,11:26.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8929,18,2,T1 ,I accidentally move that,,11:26.0,11:29.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8930,18,2,T1 ,,okay okay so subtract three sevenths,11:29.0,11:32.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8931,18,2,T1 ,you would not subtract,,11:32.0,11:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8932,18,2,T1 ,because subtraction is the inverse of addition,,11:34.0,11:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8933,18,2,T1 ,what you want to do here is sense this is multiplication,,11:37.0,11:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8934,18,2,T1 ,and you want to do the inverse of multiplication then,,11:39.0,11:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8935,18,2,T1 ,,okay division pause filler division remember I'm not sure how to do this,11:41.0,12:49.0,01:08.0,,,,,,
8936,18,2,T1 ,,like I'm going to make some fraction between five and six,12:57.0,13:04.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8937,18,2,T1 ,so you get that we need to pause filler use division here right,,13:06.0,13:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8938,18,2,T1 ,,yeah dividing three sevenths to both sides so,13:11.0,13:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8939,18,2,T1 ,so do you know how to divide with fractions,,13:16.0,13:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8940,18,2,T1 ,,I thought it was just like normal division,13:19.0,13:27.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8941,18,2,T1 ,not exactly,,13:28.0,13:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8942,18,2,T1 ,,remembering it like multiplication,13:31.0,13:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8943,18,2,T1 ,I mean normal division could be done like this,,13:34.0,13:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8944,18,2,T1 ,but what you do is you multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction,,13:38.0,13:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8945,18,2,T1 ,,oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yes I guess yes okay so forty (inaudible) divisible by three is it,13:42.0,14:01.0,00:19.0,,,,,,
8946,18,2,T1 ,,no it's not,14:01.0,14:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8947,18,2,T1 ,what,,14:04.0,14:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8948,18,2,T1 ,so pause filler I actually don't believe this would be divisible by three one thing,,14:06.0,14:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8949,18,2,T1 ,pause filler that is five,,14:09.0,14:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8950,18,2,T1 ,,I think it's divisible by anything just as a fraction,14:11.0,14:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8951,18,2,T1 ,pause filler if five time two to the power of three times seven so now there's no (inaudible) units pause filler (inaudible) occasion between,,14:15.0,14:27.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8952,18,2,T1 ,that's not divisible by three,,14:27.0,14:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8953,18,2,T1 ,,pause filler I'm not sure what to do here,14:32.0,14:36.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8954,18,2,T1 ,so I yeah it looks like it's fine,,14:37.0,14:39.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8955,18,2,T1 ,if you just write it up all fraction so,,14:39.0,14:42.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8956,18,2,T1 ,pause filler do you know how to multiply a fraction by a whole number,,14:43.0,14:49.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8957,18,2,T1 ,,pause filler yes multiply it straight across,14:50.0,14:53.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8958,18,2,T1 ,yeah because basically forty is the same as forty divided by one,,14:54.0,15:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8959,18,2,T1 ,,yeah okay oh please don't tell me,15:02.0,15:12.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8960,18,2,T1 ,okay pause filler,,15:05.0,15:06.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8961,18,2,T1 ,,it can't (inaudible),15:12.0,15:19.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8962,18,2,T1 ,pause filler with all my intern let me try,,15:20.0,15:32.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
8963,18,2,T1 ,,oh pause filler thank you,15:35.0,15:42.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8964,18,2,T1 ,okay so this is not right,,16:12.0,16:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8965,18,2,T1 ,remember here you're multiplying by the reciprocal of the three sevenths,,16:15.0,16:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8966,18,2,T1 ,,oh oh no okay yes okay pause filler hello,16:21.0,16:58.0,00:37.0,,,,,,
8967,18,2,T1 ,hello,,16:58.0,16:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8968,18,2,T1 ,,yeah (inaudible) do this oh wait,17:00.0,17:13.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
8969,18,2,T1 ,,so I'm not going to ask,17:13.0,17:20.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8970,18,2,T1 ,,pause filler I will just raise up,17:20.0,17:30.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8971,18,2,T1 ,,am I allowed to erase anything,17:30.0,17:40.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8972,18,2,T1 ,good question anyway pause filler here,,17:41.0,17:46.0,00:05.0,,,UL,,,
8973,18,2,T1 ,,can I not draw anything,17:46.0,17:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8974,18,2,T1 ,oh well pause filler do you see my writing that,,17:49.0,17:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8975,18,2,T1 ,,no oh there you go,17:54.0,17:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8976,18,2,T1 ,pause filler okay you're (inaudible) behind on your connection or something,,17:55.0,17:59.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8977,18,2,T1 ,,oh okay the equal sign is Spanish,18:01.0,18:07.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8978,18,2,T1 ,yeah I erased it,,18:08.0,18:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8979,18,2,T1 ,,oh oh okay okay okay yeah I think,18:09.0,18:12.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8980,18,2,T1 ,,I'm just behind,18:12.0,18:16.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8981,18,2,T1 ,yeah,,18:16.0,18:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
8982,18,2,T1 ,,just I got back up,18:17.0,18:31.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
8983,18,2,T1 ,yup,,18:35.0,18:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
8984,18,2,T1 ,,when you make sure (inaudible) bigger it seems like it's not,18:37.0,18:45.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
8985,18,2,T1 ,,like it's seven or three,18:45.0,18:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8986,18,2,T1 ,okay so this is basically the same problem,,18:51.0,18:54.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8987,18,2,T1 ,it goes off it reverse the equation fraction,,18:59.0,19:05.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8988,18,2,T1 ,,,19:01.0,21:51.0,02:50.0,,,,,,
8989,18,2,T1 ,,so what if that were just to revert,19:05.0,19:11.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
8990,18,2,T1 ,,just change it back to the other one or,19:11.0,19:15.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
8991,18,2,T1 ,I mean you could reverse the direction if you want to,,19:15.0,19:18.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
8992,18,2,T1 ,I typically do that,,19:18.0,19:20.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
8993,18,2,T1 ,I like to define things in terms of the variable rather than the constant,,19:20.0,19:27.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
8994,18,2,T1 ,in other words something like k equals a number,,19:27.0,19:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8995,18,2,T1 ,rather than a number it's k,,19:32.0,19:42.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
8996,18,2,T1 ,,yeah yeah a hundred did you shoot that Joe,19:44.0,20:01.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
8997,18,2,T1 ,the difficult won't be this level by three only (inaudible) seven power oh (inaudible) would be seven and two four so (inaudible) but it will be divisible by or seven,,20:01.0,21:20.0,01:19.0,,,,,,
8998,18,2,T1 ,,one second,21:22.0,21:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
8999,18,2,T1 ,let me take care of that pause filler negative four three two yeah,,21:31.0,22:50.0,01:19.0,,,,,,
9000,18,2,T1 ,,,21:56.0,28:00.0,06:04.0,,,,,,
9001,18,2,T1 ,,okay,22:55.0,22:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9002,18,2,T1 ,isn't it correct okay so (inaudible),,22:59.0,23:04.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9003,18,2,T1 ,okay so pause filler again this here is multiplication,,23:05.0,23:12.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9004,18,2,T1 ,but because of we basically go into,,23:13.0,23:17.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9005,18,2,T1 ,the order of operation is backwards,,23:17.0,23:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9006,18,2,T1 ,because we're more actually going through,,23:19.0,23:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9007,18,2,T1 ,pause filler what's it called anyway,,23:23.0,23:29.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9008,18,2,T1 ,pause filler we're actually going through an expression,,23:29.0,23:31.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9009,18,2,T1 ,pause filler we're reversing the equation,,23:34.0,23:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9010,18,2,T1 ,we need to go throw it backwards,,23:36.0,23:37.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9011,18,2,T1 ,so we need to deal with this first,,23:38.0,23:40.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9012,18,2,T1 ,,so okay,23:44.0,23:45.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9013,18,2,T1 ,okay so now we simplify this down to an equation in a (inaudible) forward so,,24:42.0,24:48.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9014,18,2,T1 ,,yeah oh so negative this time though,24:48.0,24:56.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9015,18,2,T1 ,yeah so the only difference is that a positive times a negative is negative,,24:57.0,25:11.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
9016,18,2,T1 ,,okay so this will probably be a negative number,25:21.0,25:49.0,00:28.0,,,,,,
9017,18,2,T1 ,yeah,,25:49.0,25:49.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9018,18,2,T1 ,,okay okay wow,25:49.0,25:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9019,18,2,T1 ,pause filler wow,,25:55.0,25:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9020,18,2,T1 ,,oh,25:55.0,25:55.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9021,18,2,T1 ,pause filler one more thing,,25:56.0,26:09.0,00:13.0,,,,,,
9022,18,2,T1 ,,oh yeah,26:14.0,26:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9023,18,2,T1 ,okay and pause filler I don't know if it wants you to simplify it that or not,,26:17.0,26:25.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9024,18,2,T1 ,but you easily could right,,26:25.0,26:27.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9025,18,2,T1 ,,yeah (inaudible) work,26:27.0,26:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9026,18,2,T1 ,the stock I'll make this equal sign write the simplify (inaudible),,26:30.0,26:39.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9027,18,2,T1 ,,yeah so you actually don't need that over one at all,26:46.0,26:52.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9028,18,2,T1 ,,because now we have a one divided by one equals x so,26:52.0,26:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9029,18,2,T1 ,so y is driven (inaudible),,26:59.0,27:17.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
9030,18,2,T1 ,,negative thought yeah,27:19.0,27:28.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9031,18,2,T1 ,okay pause filler okay (inaudible) I think the (inaudible) for both could be fourth,,27:28.0,27:36.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9032,18,2,T1 ,,because (inaudible),27:38.0,27:39.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9033,18,2,T1 ,I believe so,,27:41.0,27:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9034,18,2,T1 ,pause filler you don't make that thing problems that you have okay thought,,27:44.0,27:49.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9035,18,2,T1 ,they don't look like,,27:49.0,27:50.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9036,18,2,T1 ,there should be one so,,27:50.0,27:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9037,18,2,T1 ,,pause filler this one here they look like four seven nine,27:52.0,27:57.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9038,18,2,T1 ,okay I don't know,,27:57.0,27:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9039,18,2,T1 ,in mine we're missing a line,,27:58.0,28:00.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9040,18,2,T1 ,,,28:00.0,29:36.0,01:36.0,,,,,,
9041,18,2,T1 ,,oh oh yeah this is really not mine,28:01.0,28:10.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9042,18,2,T1 ,I don't think it's their own mind at all okay (inaudible) so pause filler,,28:17.0,28:23.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9043,18,2,T1 ,,what did I,28:24.0,28:28.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9044,18,2,T1 ,uh-oh equal to one and,,28:28.0,28:36.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9045,18,2,T1 ,,wait I didn't write this,28:37.0,28:45.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9046,18,2,T1 ,you didn't,,28:45.0,28:48.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9047,18,2,T1 ,,no it just popped up,28:48.0,28:56.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9048,18,2,T1 ,what (inaudible),,28:56.0,28:56.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9049,18,2,T1 ,pause filler we plus the ten that didn't happen,,28:57.0,28:59.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9050,18,2,T1 ,,I'm going to go ask them though that,28:59.0,29:01.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9051,18,2,T1 ,oh okay,,29:01.0,29:01.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9052,18,2,T1 ,hello,,29:02.0,29:02.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9053,18,2,T1 ,,wait it just popped up there,29:07.0,29:10.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9054,18,2,T1 ,,I couldn't just undo it,29:10.0,29:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9055,18,2,T1 ,yeah in fact he didn't write this,,29:16.0,29:19.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9056,18,2,T1 ,it just appeared this,,29:19.0,29:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9057,18,2,T1 ,unnecessary (inaudible),,29:21.0,29:22.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9058,18,2,T1 ,(inaudible),,29:27.0,29:28.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9059,18,2,T1 ,I think he didn't write it,,29:28.0,29:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9060,18,2,T1 ,,and just after a little bit of I did it,29:30.0,29:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9061,18,2,T1 ,,I crossed undo and it disappeared,29:33.0,29:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9062,18,2,T1 ,,okay,29:50.0,29:50.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9063,18,2,T1 ,yeah we were on it for a while,,30:02.0,30:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9064,18,2,T1 ,and then it disappeared,,30:04.0,30:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9065,18,2,T1 ,I don't know,,30:10.0,30:11.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9066,18,2,T1 ,we hadn't written anything on (inaudible) forty-four,,30:11.0,30:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9067,18,2,T1 ,pause filler okay are we good (inaudible),,30:19.0,30:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9068,18,2,T1 ,yeah,,30:36.0,30:36.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9069,18,2,T1 ,,see that's interesting not just I think that the king can be very very powerful if you're careful about when and then where you use them,31:27.0,31:38.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
9070,18,2,T1 ,yeah,,31:39.0,31:39.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9071,18,2,T1 ,,because you know you charge them into middle piece,31:41.0,31:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9072,18,2,T1 ,,or you're going to get surrounded easily,31:44.0,31:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9073,18,2,T1 ,,but you know there's just like some of them like around your area,31:49.0,31:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9074,18,2,T1 ,,you can just go around and take them out because like a single like in a single community,31:54.0,32:10.0,00:16.0,,,,,,
9075,18,2,T1 ,,like it's next to a community,32:11.0,32:17.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9076,18,2,T1 ,,like it's pathetic,32:17.0,32:19.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9077,18,2,S2 ,,,32:17.0,37:15.0,04:58.0,,,,,,
9078,18,2,S2 ,,because you can't handle actually,32:19.0,32:23.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9079,18,2,S2 ,I mean the queen you moved anywhere,,32:23.0,32:26.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9080,18,2,S2 ,or the king (inaudible) hits itself,,32:26.0,32:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9081,18,2,S2 ,,no it could run out to the king,32:28.0,32:30.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9082,18,2,S2 ,,the king will be in checkmate,32:30.0,32:32.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9083,18,2,S2 ,yeah,,32:35.0,32:35.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9084,18,2,S2 ,,oh well I mean it's oblivion pause filler the king being able to kill the queen,32:35.0,32:44.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9085,18,2,S2 ,yeah the queen can be able to relatively would fell ever learned the king again and more,,32:44.0,32:50.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9086,18,2,S2 ,,the thing that makes like the king important is that it's how you win the game and to lose the game,32:52.0,32:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9087,18,2,S2 ,,I mean you know they're definitely (inaudible) the kings pause filler insensibility to your advantage,32:59.0,33:23.0,00:24.0,,,,,,
9088,18,2,S2 ,,because like the king is (inaudible),33:23.0,33:25.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9089,18,2,S2 ,,it can't be killed by a piece,33:25.0,33:33.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9090,18,2,S2 ,well that's partially true for other pieces too,,33:33.0,33:37.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9091,18,2,S2 ,because the part of the king is you're not allowed to move it to a place where it's (inaudible) the other pieces,,33:37.0,33:44.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9092,18,2,S2 ,if you're being careful you could avoid moving it to a place where it's (inaudible) and pinned,,33:44.0,33:47.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9093,18,2,S2 ,,yes but the king has very free movement,33:47.0,33:50.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9094,18,2,S2 ,,and you know like the queen you want to keep safe,33:50.0,33:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9095,18,2,S2 ,,because the queen is very powerful,33:52.0,33:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9096,18,2,S2 ,yeah,,33:54.0,33:55.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9097,18,2,S2 ,,like definitely more powerful than the king but I think the king is the second most powerful piece,33:55.0,34:04.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9098,18,2,S2 ,so are you saying that there are other pieces that have more free to movement because of their distance,,34:04.0,34:13.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9099,18,2,S2 ,or even the night you can jump over pieces,,34:14.0,34:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9100,18,2,S2 ,but the point is those you end up being sacrifice all the king,,34:18.0,34:25.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9101,18,2,S2 ,you're guarding it with every pieces you have,,34:26.0,34:28.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9102,18,2,S2 ,so the king is not powerful but strategically important,,34:28.0,34:33.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9103,18,2,S2 ,his power lies in is actually a weakness,,34:34.0,34:39.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9104,18,2,S2 ,it's how your opponent will attempt to win the game,,34:39.0,34:41.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9105,18,2,S2 ,,yeah but like how like any pieces are just like relatively close to you in your base,34:41.0,34:49.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9106,18,2,S2 ,,you can stay involved easily,34:49.0,34:51.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9107,18,2,S2 ,,just like if you go close to them they will most likely move back to the base,34:52.0,34:58.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9108,18,2,S2 ,,because usually any pieces that get there either cannot go back or pause filler are like,34:58.0,35:06.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9109,18,2,S2 ,,because you know a piece that really make I get there upon which you know,35:07.0,35:12.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9110,18,2,S2 ,,that's the only piece that can't go backwards until pause filler it reaches the other side of work,35:12.0,35:18.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9111,18,2,S2 ,the thing is you can really use any piece to steer an opponent off as long as,,35:18.0,35:25.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9112,18,2,S2 ,pause filler it's in a place where it can take your opponent's speed can't take it,,35:25.0,35:30.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9113,18,2,S2 ,knights are amazing at this because of them,,35:30.0,35:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9114,18,2,S2 ,they're both some of the weirdest patterns of movement,,35:33.0,35:36.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9115,18,2,S2 ,and they can jump over on little pieces than rooks and bishops for any attacks are,,35:36.0,35:43.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9116,18,2,S2 ,pause filler and pawns threaten rooks and knights,,35:46.0,35:49.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9117,18,2,S2 ,but the pawns are also commonly used to protect knights,,35:49.0,35:53.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9118,18,2,S2 ,,so this has ruin chess,35:58.0,36:03.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9119,18,2,S2 ,,but if your pawns are like sending off against each other in the middle of the board,36:04.0,36:07.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9120,18,2,S2 ,,I can't remember what's called,36:07.0,36:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9121,18,2,S2 ,,but it's like you couldn't move the pawn the way it would normally move to attack,36:09.0,36:14.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9122,18,2,S2 ,,it kills the pawn that is important to that though,36:14.0,36:21.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9123,18,2,S2 ,interesting in what variant is this,,36:21.0,36:24.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9124,18,2,S2 ,,not much us currently,36:26.0,36:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9125,18,2,S2 ,I don't think that's correct,,36:31.0,36:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9126,18,2,S2 ,because some of them are popular opening half two pieces standing off for the only time,,36:32.0,36:40.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9127,18,2,S2 ,,I mean it's like one of those rules that people don't really know about,36:40.0,36:50.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
9128,18,2,S2 ,so the thing is openings like this are even popular among like chess masters who has memorized books full of chess strategies,,37:29.0,37:39.0,00:10.0,,,,,,
9129,18,2,S2 ,,yeah like when I find installed me the,37:41.0,37:43.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9130,18,2,S2 ,,like it might just be a rule that was made up by the chess class or the chess class,37:43.0,37:55.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
9131,18,2,S2 ,yeah probably probably it's helpful,,37:55.0,37:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9132,18,2,S2 ,like the chess rules very rarely get changed,,37:59.0,38:03.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9133,18,2,S2 ,we have a how class game it is,,38:03.0,38:06.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9134,18,2,S2 ,but I remember one time in the 1990s,,38:06.0,38:11.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9135,18,2,S2 ,it was changed it,,38:11.0,38:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9136,18,2,T2 ,,,38:12.0,58:55.0,20:43.0,,,,,,
9137,18,2,T2 ,,,38:12.0,40:51.0,02:39.0,,,,,,
9138,18,2,T2 ,pause filler because it used to be that when you got your pawn to the other side you could transform it into any piece in the master competition,,38:14.0,38:21.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9139,18,2,T2 ,so a way the game could go where a player would win by transforming a piece into an enemy piece,,38:21.0,38:27.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9140,18,2,T2 ,,oh that works,38:32.0,38:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9141,18,2,T2 ,yeah and you weren't going to transform it into kings,,38:34.0,38:37.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9142,18,2,T2 ,but that was it,,38:37.0,38:37.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9143,18,2,T2 ,and it was basically like pause filler you stopped them from pause filler getting out of checkmate by stopping them from moving to that certain point or something,,38:37.0,38:48.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
9144,18,2,T2 ,,oh she like she can stop or paying from going into checkmate,38:50.0,38:59.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9145,18,2,T2 ,yeah it's like you can (inaudible) your king from doing a checkmate,,39:00.0,39:02.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9146,18,2,T2 ,or you can view,,39:02.0,39:04.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9147,18,2,T2 ,your opponent can move to by putting your opponent into checkmate,,39:04.0,39:11.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9148,18,2,T2 ,or if you can,,39:11.0,39:11.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9149,18,2,T2 ,or they can move to or something,,39:11.0,39:13.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9150,18,2,T2 ,,oh wow,39:14.0,39:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9151,18,2,T2 ,oh so well got a problem,,39:15.0,39:20.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9152,18,2,T2 ,,we can imagine that it would be difficult,39:21.0,39:23.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9153,18,2,T2 ,,because you need to arm,39:24.0,39:27.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9154,18,2,T2 ,,which piece is the one that you control,39:27.0,39:29.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9155,18,2,T2 ,mm-hmm the thing is your opponent now controls what makes you (inaudible),,39:31.0,39:33.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9156,18,2,T2 ,okay I got this problem down,,39:33.0,39:38.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9157,18,2,T2 ,if you multiply both sides by x and divide both sides by twenty-five you get as one twenty-five which makes sense,,39:38.0,39:47.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9158,18,2,T2 ,because one divided by pause filler one divided by twenty-five is sort of equal twenty-two,,39:47.0,39:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9159,18,2,T2 ,and so one divided by a number of that number is a reciprocal,,39:52.0,39:56.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9160,18,2,T2 ,one divided by twenty-fifth is therefore twenty-five,,39:56.0,40:04.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9161,18,2,T2 ,,okay,40:14.0,40:14.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9162,18,2,T2 ,okay eighty pause filler eighty pause filler so like I could do this (inaudible) actually (inaudible) about y then dividing by eighty,,40:16.0,40:54.0,00:38.0,,,,,,
9163,18,2,T2 ,,,40:51.0,44:40.0,03:49.0,,,,,,
9164,18,2,T2 ,the simple way to do that is just to switch with you out right yeah,,40:54.0,40:59.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9165,18,2,T2 ,,trying to match this up to something okay oh,41:00.0,41:11.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
9166,18,2,T2 ,,oh okay wait are you getting under the y and pause filler the stuff right here,41:11.0,41:32.0,00:21.0,,,,,,
9167,18,2,T2 ,pause filler the y is over here,,41:32.0,41:34.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9168,18,2,T2 ,basically I did two things at once,,41:35.0,41:37.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9169,18,2,T2 ,I multiplied by y to get negative equals eighty y,,41:38.0,41:42.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9170,18,2,T2 ,then just divide both sides by eighty,,41:42.0,41:44.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9171,18,2,T2 ,then I can easily be done just fixing the possessions of the y and the eighty,,41:45.0,41:50.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9172,18,2,T2 ,,it's like I'm going to test tablet if and that (inaudible) wrong but,42:00.0,42:34.0,00:34.0,,,,,,
9173,18,2,T2 ,,and it's like it's doing a different way in the book,42:35.0,42:43.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9174,18,2,T2 ,okay pause filler how is it doing it,,42:43.0,42:47.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9175,18,2,T2 ,I'm not actually a wire of the generally accepted pause filler way to do problems like this,,42:47.0,42:52.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9176,18,2,T2 ,,it will be like,42:52.0,42:54.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9177,18,2,T2 ,,it's kind of more of the seventeen then pause filler getting rid of the variable on this side pause filler,42:55.0,43:01.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9178,18,2,T2 ,so yeah how is it getting more of is it multiplying both sides by y,,43:03.0,43:07.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9179,18,2,T2 ,,yeah just multiplying both sides by y,43:07.0,43:09.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9180,18,2,T2 ,,and then it's getting rid of,43:09.0,43:11.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9181,18,2,T2 ,,it would be getting rid of the eighty,43:11.0,43:14.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9182,18,2,T2 ,so yeah it divides by five by eighty right,,43:14.0,43:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9183,18,2,T2 ,,I mean the answer is the same format as the answer in this one,43:18.0,43:22.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9184,18,2,T2 ,I'm doing the same thing basically and just getting us back by saying about,,43:22.0,43:27.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9185,18,2,T2 ,I know it's the same if I flop these two out,,43:27.0,43:30.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9186,18,2,T2 ,,which two oh,43:31.0,43:34.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9187,18,2,T2 ,the y and the eighty,,43:34.0,43:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9188,18,2,T2 ,,okay okay,43:37.0,43:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9189,18,2,T2 ,so minus fifty-four,,43:50.0,43:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9190,18,2,T2 ,,okay so pause filler the next thing here (inaudible),43:54.0,44:00.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9191,18,2,T2 ,pause filler so well well it's one hundred two minus forty hundred minus thirty-eight seventy minus eight sixty-two here four over k (inaudible) equals,,44:00.0,44:35.0,00:35.0,,,,,,
9192,18,2,T2 ,pause filler it's supposed to be sixty-two,,44:36.0,44:42.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9193,18,2,T2 ,,,44:40.0,52:48.0,08:08.0,,,,,,
9194,18,2,T2 ,so four all right I did my contraction correct,,44:42.0,44:49.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9195,18,2,T2 ,there like forty one o two minus,,44:49.0,44:54.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9196,18,2,T2 ,,wait what number or symbol is like this right here,44:54.0,45:02.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9197,18,2,T2 ,pause filler oh I'm subtracting fifty-four from both sides,,45:02.0,45:14.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
9198,18,2,T2 ,,it's a five,45:14.0,45:16.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9199,18,2,T2 ,yeah,,45:16.0,45:16.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9200,18,2,T2 ,,okay okay,45:16.0,45:22.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9201,18,2,T2 ,,okay yes,45:23.0,45:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9202,18,2,T2 ,pause filler yeah then this can be simplified,,45:26.0,45:30.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9203,18,2,T2 ,so this is ten k equals over thirteen,,45:30.0,45:35.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9204,18,2,T2 ,okay pause filler,,45:35.0,45:36.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9205,18,2,T2 ,wait it does not make (inaudible),,45:47.0,45:48.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9206,18,2,T2 ,pause filler I have the number,,45:48.0,45:55.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9207,18,2,T2 ,pause filler I think that makes sense,,45:55.0,45:58.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9208,18,2,T2 ,pause filler two that's one hundred okay or,,46:00.0,46:08.0,00:08.0,,,,,,
9209,18,2,T2 ,,that's one hundred and sixteen,46:08.0,46:15.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9210,18,2,T2 ,okay so I got it right like right now from (inaudible),,46:16.0,46:28.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
9211,18,2,T2 ,,pause filler (inaudible),46:17.0,46:18.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9212,18,2,T2 ,,maybe pause filler so I'm attempting,46:28.0,46:32.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9213,18,2,T2 ,,they're not there (inaudible) but attempting to match this up,46:32.0,46:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9214,18,2,T2 ,,pause filler do you like this system,46:37.0,46:40.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9215,18,2,T2 ,not really,,46:40.0,46:41.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9216,18,2,T2 ,,I feel like it would be better if it was different subjects,46:41.0,46:48.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9217,18,2,T2 ,,like I would teach you about science,46:50.0,46:52.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9218,18,2,T2 ,,and then you would teach me about history,46:52.0,46:59.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9219,18,2,T2 ,yeah something like that,,47:01.0,47:02.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9220,18,2,T2 ,,yeah so we kind of eliminate the aspect of somebody being better than the other I think,47:03.0,47:08.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9221,18,2,T2 ,I think what they're trying to do with where and about how people learn about math pause filler,,47:08.0,47:11.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9222,18,2,T2 ,,I think you're definitely better at math than me,47:11.0,47:22.0,00:11.0,,,LPA,,,
9223,18,2,T2 ,pause filler I might have made a mistake here,,47:23.0,47:24.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9224,18,2,T2 ,,the first stuff (inaudible) were here,47:24.0,47:30.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9225,18,2,T2 ,,that sounds right,47:31.0,47:32.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9226,18,2,T2 ,yeah but if one sixteen minus fifty-four were equal to sixty-two,,47:32.0,47:38.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9227,18,2,T2 ,let me work that out,,47:39.0,47:40.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9228,18,2,T2 ,oh no it's over here,,47:41.0,47:44.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9229,18,2,T2 ,I think I got it right,,47:44.0,47:46.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9230,18,2,T2 ,but I was doing in my head for the rest of,,47:46.0,47:48.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9231,18,2,T2 ,,pause filler let's see so I mean it's fifty minus a hundred and fourteen essentially,47:48.0,47:57.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9232,18,2,T2 ,,so fifty-four I think it will be sixty-four wouldn't that,47:58.0,48:04.0,00:06.0,,,,,,
9233,18,2,T2 ,pause filler let me think,,48:04.0,48:06.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9234,18,2,T2 ,no it has to end in a two,,48:06.0,48:10.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9235,18,2,T2 ,because six minus four is two,,48:10.0,48:15.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9236,18,2,T2 ,,oh oh yeah yeah sixty-two I think so,48:15.0,48:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9237,18,2,T2 ,so you have sixty-two,,48:19.0,48:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9238,18,2,T2 ,,yeah we just have a hundred ten not a hundred,48:21.0,48:33.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
9239,18,2,T2 ,,it's hundred and twelve not a hundred and two okay pause filler okay,48:35.0,48:52.0,00:17.0,,,,,,
9240,18,2,T2 ,,pause filler I think you're right pause filler,48:53.0,48:56.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9241,18,2,T2 ,I'm pretty sure I ran out with the only part,,48:57.0,49:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9242,18,2,T2 ,I would make sure eight,,49:00.0,49:04.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9243,18,2,T2 ,,oh oh yeah,49:04.0,49:05.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9244,18,2,T2 ,like you may division here correctly actually no,,49:05.0,49:08.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9245,18,2,T2 ,so I'm connecting for fifty-two,,49:08.0,49:10.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9246,18,2,T2 ,,pause filler division is my worst nightmare so yeah,49:10.0,49:12.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9247,18,2,T2 ,yeah I did my division here correctly sorry pause filler,,49:12.0,49:15.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9248,18,2,T2 ,,pause filler yeah I was just pause filler they on the test booklet,49:15.0,49:19.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9249,18,2,T2 ,,they had to the answer pause filler the other way around so it,49:19.0,49:22.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9250,18,2,T2 ,,what under eight equals k,49:22.0,49:24.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9251,18,2,T2 ,yeah it's one thirteenth,,49:24.0,49:26.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9252,18,2,T2 ,,you wrote one thirteenth,49:29.0,49:30.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9253,18,2,T2 ,but (inaudible) actually,,49:32.0,49:32.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9254,18,2,T2 ,,I'm not sure if it is,49:32.0,49:37.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9255,18,2,T2 ,it definitely isn't thirteenth (inaudible) fifty-two and not sixty-two,,49:38.0,49:45.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9256,18,2,T2 ,,thirteen wait,49:46.0,49:47.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9257,18,2,T2 ,here honestly I have one thirteenth,,49:47.0,49:49.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9258,18,2,T2 ,I simplified attempted to get that from simplifying,,49:49.0,49:52.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9259,18,2,T2 ,,wait one second,49:52.0,49:53.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9260,18,2,T2 ,forty-six over sixty-two,,49:54.0,49:56.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9261,18,2,T2 ,,oh it is sixty-two,49:57.0,49:58.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9262,18,2,T2 ,yeah I think I sort of (inaudible) over thirty-one,,49:59.0,50:02.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9263,18,2,T2 ,,oh wait it is sixty-two though because,50:03.0,50:05.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9264,18,2,T2 ,yeah it's four over sixty-two isn't it,,50:06.0,50:09.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9265,18,2,T2 ,,oh like I'm really confused,50:10.0,50:19.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9266,18,2,T2 ,,okay so in the next step on this they are multiplying each side by k or by the variable so,50:19.0,50:30.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
9267,18,2,T2 ,,and that's the second step,50:30.0,50:33.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9268,18,2,T2 ,yeah that's essentially what I'm doing,,50:34.0,50:36.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9269,18,2,T2 ,it's the same by a full,,50:36.0,50:39.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9270,18,2,T2 ,like do we both get to come out to k for over sixty-two at some point,,50:39.0,50:44.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9271,18,2,T2 ,,wait pause filler I feel like you did two steps in one somewhere right here,50:44.0,50:56.0,00:12.0,,,,,,
9272,18,2,T2 ,yeah that's what I did,,50:56.0,51:00.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9273,18,2,T2 ,,okay yeah because this is the step that is not in you in your problem okay okay oops to be correct,51:01.0,51:28.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
9274,18,2,T2 ,okay it's a k equals two over thirty-one,,51:28.0,51:42.0,00:14.0,,,,,,
9275,18,2,T2 ,,and then you need to get,51:43.0,51:48.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9276,18,2,T2 ,,pause filler I think it's correct,51:48.0,51:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9277,18,2,T2 ,,yeah I'm pretty sure that's correct,51:51.0,51:58.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9278,18,2,T2 ,okay,,51:58.0,51:59.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9279,18,2,T2 ,,pause filler I don't know,51:59.0,51:59.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9280,18,2,T2 ,,I'd like to (inaudible) next second,51:59.0,52:10.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
9281,18,2,T2 ,okay pause filler we're getting the fourteen over four hundred k or a thirty times nine,,52:10.0,52:21.0,00:11.0,,,,,,
9282,18,2,T2 ,,so it would be negative two over three or five okay (inaudible) that in a moment,52:25.0,52:56.0,00:31.0,,,,,,
9283,18,2,T2 ,,y is equals to negative one fifteenth,52:57.0,53:00.0,00:03.0,,,,,,
9284,18,2,T2 ,,,53:02.0,56:18.0,03:16.0,,,,,,
9285,18,2,T2 ,,so you first said is multiplying both sides by y,53:04.0,54:14.0,01:10.0,,,,,,
9286,18,2,T2 ,yeah and dividing both sides by two hundred ten and simplify them,,54:14.0,54:19.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9287,18,2,T2 ,,oh,54:19.0,54:20.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9288,18,2,T2 ,negative fourteen over two hundred ten simplifies to negative one fifteenth I believe,,54:29.0,54:33.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9289,18,2,T2 ,,okay,54:33.0,54:34.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9290,18,2,T2 ,seventy plus one hundred forty,,54:38.0,54:47.0,00:09.0,,,,,,
9291,18,2,T2 ,,okay,54:48.0,54:49.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9292,18,2,T2 ,okay,,54:54.0,54:54.0,00:00.0,,,,,,
9293,18,2,T2 ,,okay okay so it's actually right,54:54.0,55:01.0,00:07.0,,,,,,
9294,18,2,T2 ,,pause filler I think your answer is right,55:01.0,55:05.0,00:04.0,,,,,,
9295,18,2,T2 ,so add twenty-four to both sides,,55:12.0,55:14.0,00:02.0,,,,,,
9296,18,2,T2 ,okay so two hundred forty (inaudible) five over x equals one hundred thirty-seven,,55:15.0,55:33.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
9297,18,2,T2 ,four x equals five over one thirty-seven,,55:34.0,55:52.0,00:18.0,,,,,,
9298,18,2,T2 ,,wait one second okay pause filler okay pause filler okay,55:52.0,56:19.0,00:27.0,,,,,,
9299,18,2,T2 ,,,56:19.0,58:24.0,02:05.0,,,,,,
9300,18,2,T2 ,interesting pause filler over pause filler what's both as a person will do is pause filler forty-nine over five,,56:32.0,57:25.0,00:53.0,,,,,,
9301,18,2,T2 ,because it's a free country,,57:27.0,57:32.0,00:05.0,,,,,,
9302,18,2,T2 ,,hey,57:32.0,57:33.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9303,18,2,T2 ,,bye,58:08.0,58:09.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
9304,18,2,T2 ,bye,,58:09.0,58:10.0,00:01.0,,,,,,
