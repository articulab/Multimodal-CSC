102,7,1,00:08:41.100,00:08:44.500,00:00:03.400,yeah I guess so,
103,7,1,00:08:45.300,00:08:46.300,00:00:01.000,,okay so
104,7,1,00:08:47.983,00:08:51.300,00:00:03.317,so first what you want to do is,
105,7,1,00:08:53.674,00:08:56.300,00:00:02.626,this is hard because I can't do the problem for you,
106,7,1,00:08:56.300,00:08:58.100,00:00:01.800,but I have to explain it,
107,7,1,00:08:58.100,00:09:01.900,00:00:03.800,,yeah okay so I think it says to add six right
108,7,1,00:09:02.158,00:09:02.491,00:00:00.333,yeah,
109,7,1,00:09:03.000,00:09:04.000,00:00:01.000,,so I guess I'll write that
110,7,1,00:09:06.300,00:09:08.449,00:00:02.149,,(laughter) it's like really big
111,7,1,00:09:09.400,00:09:13.600,00:00:04.200,,okay plus oh just like they're like so then
112,7,1,00:09:13.700,00:09:14.300,00:00:00.600,,oh my god
113,7,1,00:09:14.300,00:09:17.300,00:00:03.000,,okay that's x equals
114,7,1,00:09:18.300,00:09:22.800,00:00:04.500,,and then thirteen plus six is six seven okay eighteen
115,7,1,00:09:24.900,00:09:26.600,00:00:01.700,,no it's nineteen
116,7,1,00:09:27.800,00:09:30.700,00:00:02.900,,wait why am I okay
117,7,1,00:09:34.633,00:09:35.900,00:00:01.267,,how do you delete it okay
118,7,1,00:09:36.000,00:09:38.600,00:00:02.600,you have to do the back arrow,
119,7,1,00:09:39.600,00:09:41.300,00:00:01.700,,how do you
120,7,1,00:09:42.108,00:09:43.874,00:00:01.766,yes it's very confusing,
121,7,1,00:09:50.700,00:09:51.200,00:00:00.500,,I'm just like
122,7,1,00:09:52.466,00:09:53.991,00:00:01.525,why wouldn't it work,
123,7,1,00:09:57.200,00:10:00.000,00:00:02.800,,oh oh it's working
124,7,1,00:10:00.000,00:10:01.800,00:00:01.800,,wait oh oh oh
125,7,1,00:10:02.400,00:10:02.900,00:00:00.500,,yay
126,7,1,00:10:02.900,00:10:04.600,00:00:01.700,,oh no there are like dots okay
127,7,1,00:10:06.200,00:10:12.983,00:00:06.783,,so all right add six to each side
128,7,1,00:10:14.716,00:10:20.699,00:00:05.983,,and that's x equals
129,7,1,00:10:21.900,00:10:24.400,00:00:02.500,,and then three plus six nineteen
130,7,1,00:10:25.700,00:10:26.500,00:00:00.800,,oh okay
131,7,1,00:10:28.100,00:10:32.600,00:00:04.500,,so it's probably right I guess because x equals nineteen now
132,7,1,00:10:32.208,00:10:33.741,00:00:01.533,yeah I guess so,
133,7,1,00:10:35.900,00:10:38.900,00:00:03.000,,yeah all right how do you go to the next one
134,7,1,00:10:39.591,00:10:40.691,00:00:01.100,,do you know
135,7,1,00:10:40.600,00:10:41.900,00:00:01.300,yes,
136,7,1,00:10:43.300,00:10:44.800,00:00:01.500,,all right oh okay
137,7,1,00:10:46.200,00:10:47.800,00:00:01.600,so now it's your turn,
138,7,1,00:10:48.600,00:10:49.400,00:00:00.800,,okay
139,7,1,00:10:51.500,00:10:58.600,00:00:07.100,so pause filler I guess I do seven no eleven,
140,7,1,00:11:00.300,00:11:03.500,00:00:03.200,plus seventeen,
141,7,1,00:11:03.600,00:11:06.100,00:00:02.500,man my handwriting is horrible,
142,7,1,00:11:06.600,00:11:08.400,00:00:01.800,okay so,
143,7,1,00:11:09.900,00:11:13.200,00:00:03.300,and I do eleven plus k,
144,7,1,00:11:13.700,00:11:16.800,00:00:03.100,so that cancels out k so,
145,7,1,00:11:16.900,00:11:18.500,00:00:01.600,,like add eleven each side
146,7,1,00:11:19.000,00:11:23.900,00:00:04.900,yeah so then it's pretty much that's twenty-eight,
147,7,1,00:11:24.900,00:11:26.400,00:00:01.500,,yeah and then plus
148,7,1,00:11:28.000,00:11:30.800,00:00:02.800,,wait yeah or subtract
149,7,1,00:11:30.800,00:11:34.700,00:00:03.900,,are you subtracting eleven because that would cancel out eleven then
150,7,1,00:11:36.600,00:11:41.500,00:00:04.900,,if you subtract it eleven because then like then that would be zero
151,7,1,00:11:41.500,00:11:43.100,00:00:01.600,,and you can just like go like that
152,7,1,00:11:43.700,00:11:47.500,00:00:03.800,,and then that would be seven wait no that would be six
153,7,1,00:11:47.500,00:11:50.400,00:00:02.900,,(laughter) you got it
154,7,1,00:11:50.500,00:11:50.800,00:00:00.300,yeah,
155,7,1,00:11:50.800,00:11:51.900,00:00:01.100,,I think so yeah
156,7,1,00:11:52.400,00:11:54.200,00:00:01.800,maybe maybe not,
157,7,1,00:11:54.700,00:11:55.900,00:00:01.200,well I have no idea,
158,7,1,00:11:57.691,00:12:01.716,00:00:04.025,,okay let's start like let's start fresh I guess
159,7,1,00:12:01.716,00:12:04.600,00:00:02.884,,like here okay
160,7,1,00:12:04.800,00:12:06.900,00:00:02.100,okay so,
161,7,1,00:12:08.800,00:12:11.100,00:00:02.300,,let's subtract the eleven from each side
162,7,1,00:12:12.100,00:12:18.200,00:00:06.100,okay so seventeen minus eleven,
163,7,1,00:12:18.200,00:12:22.900,00:00:04.700,and k minus eleven,
164,7,1,00:12:22.900,00:12:24.400,00:00:01.500,if I did equals eleven,
165,7,1,00:12:25.399,00:12:26.824,00:00:01.425,,I just like scratch out the one
166,7,1,00:12:25.408,00:12:26.191,00:00:00.783,I have no idea,
167,7,1,00:12:30.800,00:12:34.200,00:00:03.400,,or did you like or you do eleven minus eleven
168,7,1,00:12:34.200,00:12:35.400,00:00:01.200,,and seventeen minus eleven
169,7,1,00:12:37.216,00:12:38.983,00:00:01.767,,and they like (inaudible) I don't know
170,7,1,00:12:39.116,00:12:46.291,00:00:07.175,yeah pause filler well k isn't going anywhere because it's not a number necessarily so,
171,7,1,00:12:47.200,00:12:48.800,00:00:01.600,,so then we can just cancel out the eleven then
172,7,1,00:12:48.800,00:12:50.200,00:00:01.400,,and would just be a k alone
173,7,1,00:12:50.500,00:12:53.800,00:00:03.300,yeah it's hardly like what I'm doing,
174,7,1,00:12:54.200,00:12:56.600,00:00:02.400,,then it could be yeah
175,7,1,00:12:56.266,00:13:01.266,00:00:05.000,okay don't judge I have no idea what that is it looks like a fish,
176,7,1,00:13:01.600,00:13:06.600,00:00:05.000,okay so then seventeen minus eleven would be six,
177,7,1,00:13:06.600,00:13:08.500,00:00:01.900,,six yeah
178,7,1,00:13:10.000,00:13:12.800,00:00:02.800,,so then six equals k oh
179,7,1,00:13:13.300,00:13:14.200,00:00:00.900,k equals six,
180,7,1,00:13:14.900,00:13:15.200,00:00:00.300,,yeah
181,7,1,00:13:15.900,00:13:16.900,00:00:01.000,we did it,
182,7,1,00:13:16.900,00:13:18.400,00:00:01.500,,circle out I'm trying to circle out
183,7,1,00:13:18.400,00:13:22.100,00:00:03.700,,okay so how do you go to the next one
184,7,1,00:13:22.300,00:13:26.399,00:00:04.099,and then nope,
185,7,1,00:13:27.091,00:13:32.300,00:00:05.209,(sfx) okay,
186,7,1,00:13:33.549,00:13:36.941,00:00:03.392,then add okay s I know how to do this one,
187,7,1,00:13:37.358,00:13:45.308,00:00:07.950,okay so what you'll have to do is you have to,
188,7,1,00:13:46.966,00:13:51.166,00:00:04.200,yeah add forty-four plus two,
189,7,1,00:13:53.758,00:13:55.824,00:00:02.066,hundred twenty,
190,7,1,00:13:56.699,00:13:57.322,00:00:00.623,,we add it
191,7,1,00:13:57.899,00:13:58.400,00:00:00.501,I think,
192,7,1,00:14:00.066,00:14:01.000,00:00:00.934,,like two hundred twenty divided forty-four
193,7,1,00:14:01.000,00:14:02.200,00:00:01.200,,pause filler
194,7,1,00:14:04.244,00:14:12.100,00:00:07.856,,because then if you did that you'd figure out how many times it goes and there's pretty much a twenty in it so x
195,7,1,00:14:12.100,00:14:13.100,00:00:01.000,ah okay I got it,
196,7,1,00:14:13.100,00:14:14.400,00:00:01.300,you have to divide it,
197,7,1,00:14:14.400,00:14:18.700,00:00:04.300,,oh yeah yeah yeah okay so I'll do
198,7,1,00:14:19.300,00:14:19.800,00:00:00.500,,oh gosh
199,7,1,00:14:19.800,00:14:20.700,00:00:00.900,,long equation
200,7,1,00:14:21.200,00:14:28.000,00:00:06.800,,(laughter) twenty-four divided by two hundred four
201,7,1,00:14:28.500,00:14:34.300,00:00:05.800,,pause filler okay so I'll just do like eighty-eight which should be like
202,7,1,00:14:36.000,00:14:40.200,00:00:04.200,,two there uh-oh
203,7,1,00:14:41.000,00:14:41.400,00:00:00.400,,oh my god
204,7,1,00:14:42.800,00:14:45.362,00:00:02.562,,okay and then two twenty okay
205,7,1,00:14:52.304,00:15:01.913,00:00:09.609,,pause filler what oh my gosh okay (laughter)
206,7,1,00:15:02.420,00:15:02.913,00:00:00.493,,oh (laughter)
207,7,1,00:15:03.855,00:15:05.159,00:00:01.304,,wait okay so I'll do okay let's try this again
208,7,1,00:15:06.500,00:15:16.500,00:00:10.000,,so forty-four divided by two hundred three
209,7,1,00:15:17.100,00:15:18.900,00:00:01.800,,it like fixes it when you write it
210,7,1,00:15:18.900,00:15:21.200,00:00:02.300,,like you write it and then
211,7,1,00:15:20.449,00:15:20.652,00:00:00.203,really,
212,7,1,00:15:21.400,00:15:23.900,00:00:02.500,,yeah like drawing a little like circle
213,7,1,00:15:23.900,00:15:25.400,00:00:01.500,,and then like changes a little
214,7,1,00:15:26.100,00:15:27.900,00:00:01.800,,do you see that like
215,7,1,00:15:32.400,00:15:35.029,00:00:02.629,well I don't want to write anything,
216,7,1,00:15:35.058,00:15:36.318,00:00:01.260,oh look at that,
217,7,1,00:15:36.463,00:15:36.550,00:00:00.087,,oh
218,7,1,00:15:37.492,00:15:37.695,00:00:00.203,okay (laughter),
219,7,1,00:15:41.600,00:15:43.300,00:00:01.700,,oh okay
220,7,1,00:15:45.400,00:15:50.652,00:00:05.252,,okay so forty-four divided or two hundred twenty divided by forty-four
221,7,1,00:15:52.300,00:15:54.300,00:00:02.000,no I'm just joking (laughter),
222,7,1,00:15:55.927,00:15:58.600,00:00:02.673,,okay I'm just going to try forty-four times
223,7,1,00:15:59.000,00:16:02.637,00:00:03.637,,I wish there was a calculator that would be nice
224,7,1,00:16:02.188,00:16:03.405,00:00:01.217,cheater,
225,7,1,00:16:03.900,00:16:05.600,00:00:01.700,,no if there was a calculator
226,7,1,00:16:05.600,00:16:07.700,00:00:02.100,there might actually be a calculator,
227,7,1,00:16:08.000,00:16:09.400,00:00:01.400,calculator,
228,7,1,00:16:09.700,00:16:14.700,00:00:05.000,wait go to that box like that window box and see,
229,7,1,00:16:16.434,00:16:18.826,00:00:02.392,,that would be cheating though
230,7,1,00:16:19.300,00:16:22.400,00:00:03.100,you wanted a calculator,
231,7,1,00:16:23.000,00:16:24.200,00:00:01.200,,okay and then
232,7,1,00:16:28.000,00:16:28.300,00:00:00.300,wow,

235,7,1,00:16:32.300,00:16:34.200,00:00:01.900,okay how about you just erase everything,
236,7,1,00:16:35.318,00:16:36.826,00:00:01.508,and then start,
237,7,1,00:16:35.700,00:16:36.900,00:00:01.200,,wait can you press delete
238,7,1,00:16:37.200,00:16:38.700,00:00:01.500,,can you press the delete thingy
239,7,1,00:16:38.900,00:16:41.724,00:00:02.824,,or that clear though or just like

254,7,1,00:17:14.500,00:17:15.700,00:00:01.200,it's on the side,
255,7,1,00:17:18.500,00:17:19.700,00:00:01.200,,I can hear it
256,7,1,00:17:19.700,00:17:21.300,00:00:01.600,,but I can't see it
257,7,1,00:17:27.900,00:17:29.600,00:00:01.700,this is going to take a while,
258,7,1,00:17:37.797,00:17:39.200,00:00:01.403,,how small is the eraser
259,7,1,00:17:39.500,00:17:40.500,00:00:01.000,very small,
260,7,1,00:17:40.550,00:17:40.652,00:00:00.102,,oh
261,7,1,00:17:43.782,00:17:45.710,00:00:01.928,,now I see it

263,7,1,00:17:50.400,00:17:51.200,00:00:00.800,,okay
264,7,1,00:17:53.200,00:17:56.600,00:00:03.400,,so how many time does forty-four
265,7,1,00:17:58.900,00:18:00.300,00:00:01.400,,go into two hundred twenty
266,7,1,00:18:00.900,00:18:02.200,00:00:01.300,oh I like this,
267,7,1,00:18:10.362,00:18:14.500,00:00:04.138,okay I think we're going to get in trouble if we keep tutoring,
268,7,1,00:18:13.710,00:18:14.217,00:00:00.507,,yeah okay
269,7,1,00:18:15.400,00:18:19.100,00:00:03.700,,that's the actual answer but
270,7,1,00:18:19.100,00:18:20.300,00:00:01.200,,okay pause filler okay
271,7,1,00:18:24.463,00:18:32.300,00:00:07.837,,I'm going to like try I'm going to see if forty-four goes into it five times
272,7,1,00:18:33.800,00:18:37.300,00:00:03.500,,and then if it does I can know if it's divisible by five
273,7,1,00:18:38.300,00:18:39.400,00:00:01.100,,wait it might work
274,7,1,00:18:39.400,00:18:39.900,00:00:00.500,,one minute
275,7,1,00:18:40.800,00:18:46.600,00:00:05.800,,two time four is twenty yeah x is five
276,7,1,00:18:47.600,00:18:48.000,00:00:00.400,,is it
277,7,1,00:18:48.300,00:18:50.400,00:00:02.100,,I don't know one minute
278,7,1,00:18:50.400,00:18:56.600,00:00:06.200,,let me okay because let's do forty-four yeah because forty-four times five is two hundred twenty
279,7,1,00:18:56.900,00:18:59.100,00:00:02.200,,so x equals five
280,7,1,00:19:00.000,00:19:01.000,00:00:01.000,congratulations,
281,7,1,00:19:01.000,00:19:02.600,00:00:01.600,I have no idea if that's right,
282,7,1,00:19:03.304,00:19:04.900,00:00:01.596,,let's just hope it is
283,7,1,00:19:04.900,00:19:05.600,00:00:00.700,yeah,
284,7,1,00:19:06.869,00:19:07.500,00:00:00.631,,all right
285,7,1,00:19:07.500,00:19:14.400,00:00:06.900,okay so next,
286,7,1,00:19:14.400,00:19:15.500,00:00:01.100,,erase that
287,7,1,00:19:15.900,00:19:17.600,00:00:01.700,,or clear oh okay
288,7,1,00:19:18.300,00:19:19.800,00:00:01.500,,oh gosh okay
289,7,1,00:19:22.000,00:19:24.500,00:00:02.500,so let's see here,
290,7,1,00:19:25.400,00:19:26.100,00:00:00.700,,do we add
291,7,1,00:19:26.500,00:19:27.200,00:00:00.700,,I think we add nine
292,7,1,00:19:27.200,00:19:28.300,00:00:01.100,wait hold on,
293,7,1,00:19:29.100,00:19:29.400,00:00:00.300,,what (laughter)
294,7,1,00:19:29.400,00:19:31.000,00:00:01.600,I'm cheating,
295,7,1,00:19:31.000,00:19:31.700,00:00:00.700,don't tell,
296,7,1,00:19:32.100,00:19:39.200,00:00:07.100,okay got it so okay so I have a paper in front of me,
297,7,1,00:19:39.300,00:19:40.000,00:00:00.700,cheating so,
298,7,1,00:19:40.681,00:19:42.376,00:00:01.695,,wait so wait
299,7,1,00:19:42.434,00:19:44.637,00:00:02.203,,are you the one tutoring me right now
300,7,1,00:19:44.700,00:19:48.400,00:00:03.700,I think so I have no idea,
301,7,1,00:19:48.400,00:19:50.300,00:00:01.900,,because I think like it switches off halfway through
302,7,1,00:19:50.300,00:19:52.600,00:00:02.300,,I think you tutor me for like half the time
303,7,1,00:19:52.600,00:19:53.500,00:00:00.900,,and then like it switches
304,7,1,00:19:53.500,00:19:55.600,00:00:02.100,,I don't know because like
305,7,1,00:19:55.600,00:20:00.000,00:00:04.400,,I don't know (laughter) because like if that's because you have the paper right
306,7,1,00:20:00.400,00:20:00.900,00:00:00.500,yeah,
307,7,1,00:20:01.200,00:20:02.300,00:00:01.100,,like the cheat sheet thing
308,7,1,00:20:03.100,00:20:04.600,00:00:01.500,yeah I think so,
309,7,1,00:20:04.800,00:20:07.400,00:00:02.600,,yeah well then yeah (laughter)
310,7,1,00:20:08.159,00:20:09.318,00:00:01.159,whoops,
311,7,1,00:20:09.768,00:20:15.100,00:00:05.332,okay so first you are going to take the nine,
312,7,1,00:20:16.000,00:20:23.800,00:00:07.800,and what you want to do is actually you want to add it to thirteen p,
313,7,1,00:20:24.200,00:20:25.800,00:00:01.600,,you want to add the nine to thirteen p
314,7,1,00:20:26.400,00:20:26.800,00:00:00.400,yeah,
315,7,1,00:20:28.400,00:20:29.200,00:00:00.800,,wait what do you mean
316,7,1,00:20:29.200,00:20:32.400,00:00:03.200,,like so or you want to add like add nine
317,7,1,00:20:32.900,00:20:35.400,00:00:02.500,,like do you want to cancel out the nine and
318,7,1,00:20:35.400,00:20:41.100,00:00:05.700,no what you want to do is you want to add nine plus negative nine which wait no,
319,7,1,00:20:41.100,00:20:42.600,00:00:01.500,,yeah yeah because (inaudible) yeah
320,7,1,00:20:42.600,00:20:44.700,00:00:02.100,,and then you could like cross that
321,7,1,00:20:44.700,00:20:46.200,00:00:01.500,yeah which would equal nine so,
322,7,1,00:20:46.200,00:20:48.500,00:00:02.300,,well wait negative nine plus nine
323,7,1,00:20:48.700,00:20:49.300,00:00:00.600,yeah,
324,7,1,00:20:49.500,00:20:50.000,00:00:00.500,,so it's zero
325,7,1,00:20:52.200,00:20:53.000,00:00:00.800,wait might be,
326,7,1,00:20:53.000,00:20:58.900,00:00:05.900,well anyway you want to make that nine to a positive,
327,7,1,00:20:59.100,00:21:01.600,00:00:02.500,so I don't know how to do that,
328,7,1,00:21:01.600,00:21:02.000,00:00:00.400,I forget,
329,7,1,00:21:02.000,00:21:05.600,00:00:03.600,,or a zero or a positive like okay
330,7,1,00:21:06.840,00:21:10.200,00:00:03.360,,I can hear my voice like going all along it's like
331,7,1,00:21:12.300,00:21:15.300,00:00:03.000,,I can hear like it goes that
332,7,1,00:21:15.300,00:21:18.000,00:00:02.700,,what are you drawing
333,7,1,00:21:18.000,00:21:19.400,00:00:01.400,,you're like hello
334,7,1,00:21:19.400,00:21:21.300,00:00:01.900,I have no idea,
335,7,1,00:21:21.300,00:21:24.100,00:00:02.800,okay let's go back to the point,
336,7,1,00:21:24.100,00:21:28.800,00:00:04.700,so what you want to do is you want to pause filler make that nine a positive,
337,7,1,00:21:29.500,00:21:30.700,00:00:01.200,,a positive so
338,7,1,00:21:31.100,00:21:34.400,00:00:03.300,yes so positive nine negative,
339,7,1,00:21:34.600,00:21:37.400,00:00:02.800,,so add eighteen and then
340,7,1,00:21:37.400,00:21:45.700,00:00:08.300,I'm going to replace this because this makes no sense (sfx) (laughter),
341,7,1,00:21:45.700,00:21:50.700,00:00:05.000,,you just erased the problem (laughter)
342,7,1,00:21:50.700,00:21:51.200,00:00:00.500,ops,
343,7,1,00:21:51.300,00:21:52.200,00:00:00.900,,there you go
344,7,1,00:21:52.200,00:21:52.500,00:00:00.300,,oh no
345,7,1,00:21:52.500,00:21:55.100,00:00:02.600,,that's because I wrote on it
346,7,1,00:21:55.100,00:21:56.200,00:00:01.100,,and you probably yeah
347,7,1,00:21:56.200,00:21:56.700,00:00:00.500,,oh gosh
348,7,1,00:21:58.500,00:21:59.400,00:00:00.900,,just like undo it
349,7,1,00:22:01.200,00:22:03.000,00:00:01.800,,there we are okay
350,7,1,00:22:03.100,00:22:03.900,00:00:00.800,ah,
351,7,1,00:22:04.100,00:22:09.900,00:00:05.800,,so are we trying to so how do you get the negative nine to a nine a positive
352,7,1,00:22:10.500,00:22:13.600,00:00:03.100,,so you add eighteen wait because that would get you there
353,7,1,00:22:13.600,00:22:16.145,00:00:02.545,no you have to keep the nine,
354,7,1,00:22:16.652,00:22:20.913,00:00:04.261,so just do nine plus thirteen,
355,7,1,00:22:21.300,00:22:21.700,00:00:00.400,,negative nine
356,7,1,00:22:22.100,00:22:23.400,00:00:01.300,no positive nine,
357,7,1,00:22:23.700,00:22:25.200,00:00:01.500,,but this is a negative nine
358,7,1,00:22:25.200,00:22:25.600,00:00:00.400,,what do you mean
359,7,1,00:22:25.600,00:22:29.600,00:00:04.000,yeah just I think don't you add it,
360,7,1,00:22:29.800,00:22:33.600,00:00:03.800,,I think you add nine because then that will cancel out like positive and
361,7,1,00:22:33.600,00:22:34.100,00:00:00.500,yeah add it,
362,7,1,00:22:34.100,00:22:36.100,00:00:02.000,,so then that would be zero and so then
363,7,1,00:22:37.500,00:22:38.811,00:00:01.311,no really,
364,7,1,00:22:38.500,00:22:44.300,00:00:05.800,,yeah because if you add negative nine and then a positive nine like they cancel out
365,7,1,00:22:44.300,00:22:46.800,00:00:02.500,,and just equal zero I think
366,7,1,00:22:47.700,00:22:50.000,00:00:02.300,maybe well I know so,
367,7,1,00:22:50.000,00:22:52.000,00:00:02.000,,(inaudible) and then you add listen
368,7,1,00:22:52.000,00:22:54.900,00:00:02.900,,and then if you do one thing to one side you have to do it to the other
369,7,1,00:22:54.900,00:22:56.700,00:00:01.800,,so you have to add nine to the side I think
370,7,1,00:22:59.500,00:23:03.000,00:00:03.500,yeah you have to add nine to both sides,
371,7,1,00:23:03.000,00:23:03.500,00:00:00.500,,yeah
372,7,1,00:23:03.800,00:23:10.900,00:00:07.100,and then you get the pause filler variable and the number together,
373,7,1,00:23:11.100,00:23:13.100,00:00:02.000,and then it has one number on the other side,
374,7,1,00:23:13.900,00:23:16.900,00:00:03.000,,so this is fifty and then this is
375,7,1,00:23:17.029,00:23:17.130,00:00:00.101,good,
376,7,1,00:23:17.507,00:23:18.600,00:00:01.093,oh my gosh,
377,7,1,00:23:18.600,00:23:19.800,00:00:01.200,okay I get it,
378,7,1,00:23:19.800,00:23:20.500,00:00:00.700,I get it,
379,7,1,00:23:20.500,00:23:25.200,00:00:04.700,okay so what you want to do is so you cancel out that nine,
380,7,1,00:23:25.200,00:23:29.200,00:00:04.000,and then you add that nine where you got it,
381,7,1,00:23:29.200,00:23:30.400,00:00:01.200,,so then forty-nine right
382,7,1,00:23:31.121,00:23:34.300,00:00:03.179,no you add it to thirteen and forty-one,
383,7,1,00:23:34.800,00:23:38.333,00:00:03.533,,wait so you add the nine to the thirteen and then negative nine and forty-one
384,7,1,00:23:38.800,00:23:39.200,00:00:00.400,yeah,
385,7,1,00:23:39.900,00:23:40.600,00:00:00.700,,okay
386,7,1,00:23:41.400,00:23:43.800,00:00:02.400,so you want to add it to both sides,
387,7,1,00:23:45.300,00:23:49.300,00:00:04.000,,but like but thirteen p is on the same side as negative nine
388,7,1,00:23:50.000,00:23:50.900,00:00:00.900,well that's separate,
389,7,1,00:23:50.900,00:23:52.200,00:00:01.300,that's like separate somehow,
390,7,1,00:23:54.707,00:23:57.565,00:00:02.858,okay but like the paper says that it's separate,
391,7,1,00:23:57.565,00:23:59.600,00:00:02.035,I don't know how,
392,7,1,00:23:59.600,00:24:00.900,00:00:01.300,confusing okay,
393,7,1,00:24:05.505,00:24:07.400,00:00:01.895,,all right what does the paper say
394,7,1,00:24:08.300,00:24:10.282,00:00:01.982,,so the I don't know
395,7,1,00:24:09.800,00:24:12.000,00:00:02.200,it's not the exact answer to that so,
396,7,1,00:24:12.000,00:24:12.800,00:00:00.800,,well yeah
397,7,1,00:24:13.200,00:24:15.100,00:00:01.900,it's a different equation,
398,7,1,00:24:15.700,00:24:19.800,00:00:04.100,so what I'm doing is I'm just switching up the numbers and variable,
399,7,1,00:24:20.400,00:24:29.300,00:00:08.900,okay so what it says to do here is so you got thirteen p equals fifty,
400,7,1,00:24:30.200,00:24:33.600,00:00:03.400,so that is probably correct,
401,7,1,00:24:34.000,00:24:34.800,00:00:00.800,I have no idea,
402,7,1,00:24:34.800,00:24:38.600,00:00:03.800,,yeah but do we have to do we have to simplify it down to one p
403,7,1,00:24:39.800,00:24:42.200,00:00:02.400,no not yet,
404,7,1,00:24:42.200,00:24:45.400,00:00:03.200,okay so then you want to divide,
405,7,1,00:24:45.600,00:24:45.800,00:00:00.200,,oh
406,7,1,00:24:45.800,00:24:50.000,00:00:04.200,thirteen divided b thirteen divide and then,
407,7,1,00:24:50.000,00:24:52.400,00:00:02.400,,and then fifty divided by thirteen
408,7,1,00:24:52.400,00:24:52.600,00:00:00.200,no,
409,7,1,00:24:53.400,00:24:56.500,00:00:03.100,you want to divide well yeah technically,
410,7,1,00:24:57.797,00:24:58.222,00:00:00.425,,okay
411,7,1,00:24:58.939,00:25:03.600,00:00:04.661,and that equals pause filler the p equals whatever,
412,7,1,00:25:03.800,00:25:12.500,00:00:08.700,,fifteen divided by thirteen is right so because if you do or now we do thirteen p divided thirteen which is p
413,7,1,00:25:13.500,00:25:14.200,00:00:00.700,,I think yeah
414,7,1,00:25:14.600,00:25:17.000,00:00:02.400,,and then fifty divided by thirteen
415,7,1,00:25:17.000,00:25:19.403,00:00:02.403,,so we can probably just write that as a fraction right
416,7,1,00:25:19.888,00:25:20.929,00:00:01.041,no you can't,
417,7,1,00:25:21.403,00:25:21.505,00:00:00.102,,no
418,7,1,00:25:22.242,00:25:22.343,00:00:00.101,no,
419,7,1,00:25:22.848,00:25:25.545,00:00:02.697,,oh gosh okay (laughter)
420,7,1,00:25:24.626,00:25:26.030,00:00:01.404,you have to divide,
421,7,1,00:25:26.232,00:25:34.979,00:00:08.747,,oh yeah okay so thirteen and then fifty
422,7,1,00:25:36.111,00:25:37.909,00:00:01.798,,so what's the
423,7,1,00:25:36.800,00:25:39.900,00:00:03.100,I think you should do the thinner pencil,
424,7,1,00:25:41.070,00:25:43.171,00:00:02.101,,but you can do that

496,7,1,00:30:25.400,00:30:27.800,00:00:02.400,I'm not paying attention to which color I'm putting in,
497,7,1,00:30:27.800,00:30:28.900,00:00:01.100,so I have no idea,
498,7,1,00:30:29.400,00:30:33.800,00:00:04.400,,yeah okay here's the melon berry
499,7,1,00:30:35.323,00:30:36.800,00:00:01.477,I don't like the melon berry,
500,7,1,00:30:39.565,00:30:41.868,00:00:02.303,,yeah it's like good but
501,7,1,00:30:42.999,00:30:43.800,00:00:00.801,not my favorite,

503,7,1,00:30:59.090,00:31:01.100,00:00:02.010,,the wild cherry one isn't that like strong
504,7,1,00:31:04.500,00:31:07.000,00:00:02.500,,have you ever had the sour Skittles
505,7,1,00:31:07.000,00:31:07.500,00:00:00.500,oh my gosh,
506,7,1,00:31:07.500,00:31:10.900,00:00:03.400,I hate it because it like make me make as like up days,
507,7,1,00:31:10.900,00:31:13.200,00:00:02.300,I was like no,
508,7,1,00:31:13.200,00:31:16.600,00:00:03.400,,like how yeah it's really this sour yeah
509,7,1,00:31:39.676,00:31:43.464,00:00:03.788,the strawberry one tastes like a strawberry starburst,
510,7,1,00:32:31.607,00:32:33.848,00:00:02.241,,oh I think they're coming
511,7,1,00:32:39.924,00:32:41.886,00:00:01.962,,because the lady just walked over
512,7,1,00:32:41.911,00:32:43.708,00:00:01.797,,she's probably coming to you yup
513,7,1,00:33:06.100,00:33:09.400,00:00:03.300,pause filler they're like on the screen,
514,7,1,00:33:45.700,00:33:49.700,00:00:04.000,,all right okay so the first one
515,7,1,00:33:53.600,00:33:55.300,00:00:01.700,,and then through the three
516,7,1,00:33:56.100,00:33:57.900,00:00:01.800,,so now I guess I'm like the tutor
517,7,1,00:33:58.400,00:34:04.200,00:00:05.800,,so negative three plus x equals twenty-two
518,7,1,00:34:03.658,00:34:06.784,00:00:03.126,is there are writing on the front of the paper,
519,7,1,00:34:06.886,00:34:07.886,00:00:01.000,mm-hmm (inaudible),
520,7,1,00:34:11.000,00:34:12.000,00:00:01.000,but handwriting,
521,7,1,00:34:12.800,00:34:13.100,00:00:00.300,,no
522,7,1,00:34:14.000,00:34:14.400,00:00:00.400,oh,
523,7,1,00:34:15.300,00:34:15.600,00:00:00.300,,why
524,7,1,00:34:16.300,00:34:18.113,00:00:01.813,because I have on mine,
525,7,1,00:34:18.202,00:34:22.177,00:00:03.975,,oh (laughter) all right
526,7,1,00:34:24.493,00:34:25.088,00:00:00.595,,so
527,7,1,00:34:29.300,00:34:34.800,00:00:05.500,,what we probably want to do first is cancel out the three
528,7,1,00:34:36.000,00:34:37.800,00:00:01.800,I would never have guessed,
529,7,1,00:34:40.481,00:34:43.088,00:00:02.607,,so how you think you're going to do that
530,7,1,00:34:45.063,00:34:50.400,00:00:05.337,,(laughter) yeah but you have to add three to both sides
531,7,1,00:34:55.911,00:34:58.924,00:00:03.013,,so then yeah plus twenty-two
532,7,1,00:35:03.924,00:35:05.367,00:00:01.443,twenty-five,
533,7,1,00:35:05.671,00:35:08.200,00:00:02.529,,yeah and then x equals twenty-five
534,7,1,00:35:08.800,00:35:13.100,00:00:04.300,,no yay oh (laughter)
535,7,1,00:35:14.772,00:35:16.886,00:00:02.114,,I was like writing it to like okay
536,7,1,00:35:20.100,00:35:20.800,00:00:00.700,,go back
537,7,1,00:35:20.800,00:35:22.200,00:00:01.400,,oh my gosh whatever
538,7,1,00:35:22.700,00:35:25.700,00:00:03.000,,okay now on the next one
539,7,1,00:35:29.500,00:35:37.700,00:00:08.200,,you're going to add you're going to like do the same thing except pause filler you're adding like y I think
540,7,1,00:35:40.400,00:35:40.900,00:00:00.500,,so
541,7,1,00:35:44.500,00:35:49.531,00:00:05.031,,so add okay so pause filler
542,7,1,00:35:49.557,00:35:53.500,00:00:03.943,,yeah wait yeah because you could then then you could cancel out the y
543,7,1,00:35:53.700,00:35:56.500,00:00:02.800,,so if you added y to both sides
544,7,1,00:35:56.500,00:35:59.800,00:00:03.300,,then yeah just try doing that
545,7,1,00:35:59.800,00:36:01.100,00:00:01.300,,adding y to both sides
546,7,1,00:36:03.063,00:36:06.633,00:00:03.570,the actual weird y because I did not mean to do that,
547,7,1,00:36:09.700,00:36:15.100,00:00:05.400,,so then yeah and so then that would be twenty-three plus y
548,7,1,00:36:15.100,00:36:18.400,00:00:03.300,wait well then that would be eighteen yeah wait,
549,7,1,00:36:18.400,00:36:24.200,00:00:05.800,,yeah because it would cancel out because the negative y and the positive y just makes zero oh
550,7,1,00:36:26.800,00:36:27.800,00:00:01.000,now wait,
551,7,1,00:36:40.400,00:36:44.700,00:00:04.300,it's really awkward that we're like in the building with all these college students,
552,7,1,00:36:44.700,00:36:47.800,00:00:03.100,it's like we're only in like seventh grade,
553,7,1,00:36:48.100,00:36:50.000,00:00:01.900,and we're only like twenty year olds,
554,7,1,00:36:50.000,00:36:51.900,00:00:01.900,it's like hi,
555,7,1,00:36:51.900,00:36:57.303,00:00:05.403,and I don't know you this is really scary okay,
556,7,1,00:36:57.949,00:37:04.848,00:00:06.899,,all right so if you added y to both sides the ys
557,7,1,00:37:05.721,00:37:08.000,00:00:02.279,I think it's adding eighteen,
558,7,1,00:37:10.000,00:37:20.700,00:00:10.700,,well because if you added y to both sides then you would because you can have the negative y I don't think
559,7,1,00:37:23.848,00:37:27.000,00:00:03.152,,like because then if you add y to both sides
560,7,1,00:37:27.000,00:37:34.500,00:00:07.500,,then pause filler then this the y on this side will become just zero
561,7,1,00:37:34.500,00:37:37.900,00:00:03.400,,sort of like have with the nine it's like you have negative nine plus nine equals zero
562,7,1,00:37:37.900,00:37:48.671,00:00:10.771,,and then this will just become twenty-three plus y equals eighteen oh (laughter) plus y equals eighteen
563,7,1,00:37:48.700,00:37:53.200,00:00:04.500,,and then like and then you could probably subtract twenty-three from each side
564,7,1,00:37:55.200,00:37:55.600,00:00:00.400,yeah,
565,7,1,00:37:55.600,00:37:58.300,00:00:02.700,,you see here you want to try it
566,7,1,00:37:59.100,00:38:00.468,00:00:01.368,,and I'll like yeah
567,7,1,00:38:41.784,00:38:43.200,00:00:01.416,,so what's in the box
568,7,1,00:38:49.595,00:38:52.500,00:00:02.905,,(laughter) all right
569,7,1,00:38:56.200,00:38:57.600,00:00:01.400,,back to the problem (laughter)
570,7,1,00:38:59.468,00:39:00.300,00:00:00.832,,oh my gosh
571,7,1,00:39:00.400,00:39:01.700,00:00:01.300,,it's on my leg pause filler
572,7,1,00:39:05.500,00:39:06.000,00:00:00.500,,so
573,7,1,00:39:08.500,00:39:09.100,00:00:00.600,,if we're
574,7,1,00:39:10.900,00:39:12.300,00:00:01.400,,just trying to go through it
575,7,1,00:39:12.300,00:39:15.200,00:00:02.900,,so if we add y to the side
576,7,1,00:39:15.200,00:39:18.900,00:00:03.700,,and we add y to the other side as well
577,7,1,00:39:18.900,00:39:20.500,00:00:01.600,,what do we have
578,7,1,00:39:22.300,00:39:22.400,00:00:00.100,,oh
579,7,1,00:39:36.253,00:39:38.000,00:00:01.747,I'm still chewing,
580,7,1,00:39:38.000,00:39:41.300,00:00:03.300,okay so I don't think we add y,
581,7,1,00:39:42.200,00:39:45.900,00:00:03.700,I think we only add y once,
582,7,1,00:39:46.500,00:39:48.900,00:00:02.400,and then it's eighteen plus twenty-three,
583,7,1,00:39:52.300,00:39:53.100,00:00:00.800,,but yeah
584,7,1,00:39:53.400,00:39:54.100,00:00:00.700,,wait what do you mean
585,7,1,00:39:56.400,00:39:59.400,00:00:03.000,I'm like explaining the problem now (laughter),
586,7,1,00:40:00.700,00:40:08.519,00:00:07.819,okay so negative y plus eighteen equals twenty,
587,7,1,00:40:08.100,00:40:08.600,00:00:00.500,,negative
588,7,1,00:40:10.300,00:40:11.063,00:00:00.763,,what do you mean
589,7,1,00:40:11.100,00:40:13.200,00:00:02.100,,how did you get that because I don't
590,7,1,00:40:13.200,00:40:14.400,00:00:01.200,it's the problem up here,
591,7,1,00:40:15.683,00:40:16.300,00:00:00.617,,oh yeah
592,7,1,00:40:16.300,00:40:19.405,00:00:03.105,,(laughter) I was like where did that come from
593,7,1,00:40:21.139,00:40:28.569,00:00:07.430,okay so we would subtract y from eighteen negative y,
594,7,1,00:40:31.000,00:40:39.300,00:00:08.300,and then we would equal twenty-three plus eighteen,
595,7,1,00:40:42.800,00:40:46.600,00:00:03.800,,but on here they have like the same form
596,7,1,00:40:46.600,00:40:53.000,00:00:06.400,,and they add like y first like
597,7,1,00:40:53.000,00:40:56.600,00:00:03.600,,around here we're pause filler it's like the same thing with different numbers
598,7,1,00:40:57.500,00:41:00.700,00:00:03.200,,they just added like the number they've added like the x first
599,7,1,00:41:02.700,00:41:03.600,00:00:00.900,,and then they add
600,7,1,00:41:03.600,00:41:08.800,00:00:05.200,,and then they subtracted the number so
601,7,1,00:41:10.700,00:41:12.911,00:00:02.211,so then it would be eighteen y,
602,7,1,00:41:15.341,00:41:18.405,00:00:03.064,,what do you mean (laughter)
603,7,1,00:41:19.400,00:41:21.800,00:00:02.400,y plus eighteen equals eighteen y,
604,7,1,00:41:22.300,00:41:23.000,00:00:00.700,,negative y
605,7,1,00:41:23.100,00:41:24.000,00:00:00.900,,remember it's negative
606,7,1,00:41:27.100,00:41:28.700,00:00:01.600,then negative eighteen y,
607,7,1,00:41:29.200,00:41:29.700,00:00:00.500,,yeah
608,7,1,00:41:31.721,00:41:38.500,00:00:06.779,,all right negative yeah eighteen negative y what because like no y has to be positive
609,7,1,00:41:43.038,00:41:43.329,00:00:00.291,,doesn't it
610,7,1,00:41:45.152,00:41:46.114,00:00:00.962,I don't know,
611,7,1,00:41:46.300,00:41:48.500,00:00:02.200,,that's like start this thing fresh again
612,7,1,00:41:49.800,00:41:52.341,00:00:02.541,,because it's like a mess (laughter)
613,7,1,00:42:10.300,00:42:14.700,00:00:04.400,,okay so let's try like what I see on the paper
614,7,1,00:42:14.700,00:42:23.400,00:00:08.700,,so let's try plus y on the side plus y on this side
615,7,1,00:42:23.800,00:42:26.600,00:00:02.800,don't you want to make the ink a little smaller,
616,7,1,00:42:27.500,00:42:28.500,00:00:01.000,,yeah I can try that
617,7,1,00:42:30.600,00:42:31.100,00:00:00.500,,here we go
618,7,1,00:42:31.100,00:42:33.000,00:00:01.900,,oh that's really strong
619,7,1,00:42:33.000,00:42:35.200,00:00:02.200,,okay there we go
620,7,1,00:42:35.200,00:42:38.974,00:00:03.774,,so now so if we add y on both sides what do we have
621,7,1,00:42:41.291,00:42:49.101,00:00:07.810,pause filler so well this is zero,
622,7,1,00:42:48.900,00:42:51.100,00:00:02.200,,yeah that would cancel out
623,7,1,00:42:51.600,00:42:54.100,00:00:02.500,and this is eighteen y,
624,7,1,00:42:54.400,00:42:55.544,00:00:01.144,,so no
625,7,1,00:42:57.303,00:42:58.595,00:00:01.292,,you won't need the
626,7,1,00:42:57.500,00:42:58.200,00:00:00.700,how,
627,7,1,00:42:58.595,00:43:03.000,00:00:04.405,,you wouldn't need the eighteen because you would add by each side
628,7,1,00:43:03.000,00:43:06.000,00:00:03.000,,so you would add y to each side of the equation
629,7,1,00:43:06.000,00:43:06.800,00:00:00.800,,so you would add y to
630,7,1,00:43:06.800,00:43:07.400,00:00:00.600,oh twenty-three,
631,7,1,00:43:07.400,00:43:09.000,00:00:01.600,it's twenty-three y,
632,7,1,00:43:09.500,00:43:10.700,00:00:01.200,,twenty-three plus y yeah
633,7,1,00:43:12.500,00:43:19.600,00:00:07.100,,so now it's going to be eighteen because it equals twenty-three plus y
634,7,1,00:43:23.500,00:43:24.100,00:00:00.600,,and then
635,7,1,00:43:27.200,00:43:31.278,00:00:04.078,,and then what do we do pause filler it's
636,7,1,00:43:31.400,00:43:32.700,00:00:01.300,that was weird,
637,7,1,00:43:33.400,00:43:34.000,00:00:00.600,,what
638,7,1,00:43:34.000,00:43:38.300,00:00:04.300,someone was staring at me it was really scary,
639,7,1,00:43:38.300,00:43:48.481,00:00:10.181,,okay (laughter) so now we have that
640,7,1,00:43:51.177,00:43:53.000,00:00:01.823,,we can cancel out the twenty-three
641,7,1,00:43:53.000,00:43:57.500,00:00:04.500,,and then so we have y alone by subtracting twenty-three from each side
642,7,1,00:43:57.500,00:44:00.100,00:00:02.600,,so do that and then yeah
643,7,1,00:44:00.300,00:44:03.200,00:00:02.900,,so what's eighteen minus twenty-three
644,7,1,00:44:05.190,00:44:05.405,00:00:00.215,eight,
645,7,1,00:44:07.329,00:44:09.152,00:00:01.823,,here let's just like write it out
646,7,1,00:44:20.100,00:44:21.500,00:00:01.400,,yeah eighteen minus twenty
647,7,1,00:44:21.500,00:44:22.700,00:00:01.200,,it's going to be negative
648,7,1,00:44:24.400,00:44:26.600,00:00:02.200,I hate negative numbers,
649,7,1,00:44:26.900,00:44:29.177,00:00:02.277,they're so confusing,
650,7,1,00:44:45.265,00:44:47.200,00:00:01.935,huh I did a circle,
651,7,1,00:44:47.500,00:44:47.900,00:00:00.400,,okay
652,7,1,00:44:48.100,00:44:49.100,00:00:01.000,sort of (laughter),
653,7,1,00:44:50.645,00:44:56.900,00:00:06.255,,so then it would be negative fifteen equals y right
654,7,1,00:44:57.600,00:44:58.000,00:00:00.400,yeah,
655,7,1,00:44:58.600,00:45:05.700,00:00:07.100,,because if we did eighteen minus twenty-three because we canceled out the twenty-three by subtracting twenty-three from it so then it's just
656,7,1,00:45:05.800,00:45:07.200,00:00:01.400,oh I figured it out,
657,7,1,00:45:07.400,00:45:12.500,00:00:05.100,,yeah and then it's just negative fifteen equals y right
658,7,1,00:45:14.800,00:45:16.300,00:00:01.500,when you press it the button,
659,7,1,00:45:16.300,00:45:17.700,00:00:01.400,it draws it,
660,7,1,00:45:19.700,00:45:20.300,00:00:00.600,,what do you mean
661,7,1,00:45:20.500,00:45:25.500,00:00:05.000,press field not the small part of it but the larger,
662,7,1,00:45:26.700,00:45:30.400,00:00:03.700,no the button the bigger yeah,
663,7,1,00:45:30.400,00:45:33.700,00:00:03.300,and then start drawing without touching it,
664,7,1,00:45:33.700,00:45:35.900,00:00:02.200,,wait
665,7,1,00:45:42.303,00:45:42.900,00:00:00.597,,I see that
666,7,1,00:45:42.900,00:45:44.126,00:00:01.226,,it like makes really little lines though
667,7,1,00:45:48.063,00:45:48.354,00:00:00.291,,oh
668,7,1,00:45:50.600,00:45:51.100,00:00:00.500,yeah,
669,7,1,00:45:51.300,00:45:52.000,00:00:00.700,,that's cool
670,7,1,00:45:56.000,00:46:00.500,00:00:04.500,I just tapped it,
671,7,1,00:46:00.500,00:46:04.400,00:00:03.900,that's really weird,
672,7,1,00:46:05.300,00:46:10.100,00:00:04.800,okay your face just got really big,
673,7,1,00:46:10.200,00:46:11.900,00:00:01.700,,really (laughter)
674,7,1,00:46:11.900,00:46:12.100,00:00:00.200,yeah,
675,7,1,00:46:12.200,00:46:17.000,00:00:04.800,,ops okay pause filler I just pressed actually pressing it
676,7,1,00:46:17.000,00:46:19.100,00:00:02.100,,okay how do we go to the next thing
677,7,1,00:46:20.500,00:46:23.200,00:00:02.700,don't you see the arrows that I've got on the page,
678,7,1,00:46:23.700,00:46:25.900,00:00:02.200,,oh I did it okay
679,7,1,00:46:26.800,00:46:27.100,00:00:00.300,,now
680,7,1,00:46:32.700,00:46:34.800,00:00:02.100,,we got to do this
681,7,1,00:46:36.700,00:46:37.600,00:00:00.900,yes,
682,7,1,00:46:37.800,00:46:43.200,00:00:05.400,,start by (laughter) adding k
683,7,1,00:46:44.455,00:46:48.860,00:00:04.405,,try adding k to each side of the equation
684,7,1,00:46:48.900,00:46:51.600,00:00:02.700,that's pretty much getting rid of the ks,
685,7,1,00:46:51.600,00:46:54.200,00:00:02.600,,well if you add k to this side
686,7,1,00:46:55.000,00:46:56.400,00:00:01.400,,and you add k to this side
687,7,1,00:46:57.700,00:46:59.300,00:00:01.600,,this will be canceled out
688,7,1,00:46:59.300,00:47:00.000,00:00:00.700,,and just be zero
689,7,1,00:47:00.000,00:47:05.600,00:00:05.600,,so it will be negative fourteen equals thirty-six
690,7,1,00:47:05.600,00:47:09.400,00:00:03.800,,and then since we add another k to the k it would be plus two k
691,7,1,00:47:09.400,00:47:11.300,00:00:01.900,,do you get that
692,7,1,00:47:14.600,00:47:17.900,00:00:03.300,what am I doing,
693,7,1,00:47:17.900,00:47:20.300,00:00:02.400,this is really scary,
694,7,1,00:47:21.100,00:47:23.700,00:00:02.600,,what did you do
695,7,1,00:47:23.700,00:47:27.100,00:00:03.400,I just made you big big,
696,7,1,00:47:27.400,00:47:28.600,00:00:01.200,I just full screened you,
697,7,1,00:47:30.139,00:47:30.962,00:00:00.823,it was weird,
698,7,1,00:47:31.800,00:47:32.400,00:00:00.600,,what do you mean
699,7,1,00:47:34.900,00:47:38.800,00:00:03.900,,there's like two videos of you
700,7,1,00:47:39.000,00:47:40.000,00:00:01.000,,there's like one right here
701,7,1,00:47:40.000,00:47:41.400,00:00:01.400,,and then there's like one up more
702,7,1,00:47:41.400,00:47:43.000,00:00:01.600,,like a little one
703,7,1,00:47:43.500,00:47:45.000,00:00:01.500,,because there's just like that
704,7,1,00:47:46.000,00:47:47.000,00:00:01.000,,(laughter)
705,7,1,00:47:47.500,00:47:48.700,00:00:01.200,,and we had two little videos
706,7,1,00:47:51.139,00:47:52.430,00:00:01.291,,how did you do that
707,7,1,00:47:54.300,00:48:02.544,00:00:08.244,this damps (laughter),
708,7,1,00:48:04.430,00:48:05.300,00:00:00.870,,where's my star
709,7,1,00:48:08.000,00:48:09.582,00:00:01.582,,all right we need to get on track
710,7,1,00:48:14.800,00:48:15.000,00:00:00.200,,so
711,7,1,00:48:19.500,00:48:20.500,00:00:01.000,,oh which one is that
712,7,1,00:48:21.607,00:48:22.962,00:00:01.355,,I'm like checking it
713,7,1,00:48:27.000,00:48:27.200,00:00:00.200,,okay
714,7,1,00:48:31.400,00:48:33.800,00:00:02.400,,this is supposed to be black I think right
715,7,1,00:48:34.721,00:48:36.316,00:00:01.595,I have no idea,
716,7,1,00:48:37.810,00:48:38.379,00:00:00.569,,I think it is
717,7,1,00:48:38.379,00:48:39.303,00:00:00.924,,he said this was supposed to be black
718,7,1,00:48:39.303,00:48:42.800,00:00:03.497,,I think yeah because mine is supposed to be green because I'm like the tutor
719,7,1,00:48:42.800,00:48:44.500,00:00:01.700,,and yours is supposed to be black
720,7,1,00:48:45.900,00:48:47.800,00:00:01.900,black is so boring,
721,7,1,00:48:50.215,00:48:51.329,00:00:01.114,it's like black,
722,7,1,00:48:53.898,00:48:56.962,00:00:03.064,like this pen it's not colorful,
723,7,1,00:48:57.000,00:48:59.126,00:00:02.126,it's just (sfx),
724,7,1,00:48:59.139,00:49:04.367,00:00:05.228,,(laughter) you need to color the pen
725,7,1,00:49:04.367,00:49:08.000,00:00:03.633,,to make it colorful yeah
726,7,1,00:49:09.329,00:49:15.278,00:00:05.949,,all right so when we added k to each side
727,7,1,00:49:16.038,00:49:17.354,00:00:01.316,this is how it look like,
728,7,1,00:49:20.190,00:49:21.050,00:00:00.860,,a comma
729,7,1,00:49:22.848,00:49:25.000,00:00:02.152,I think it's too big to be a comma,
730,7,1,00:49:27.417,00:49:29.101,00:00:01.684,probably it came,
731,7,1,00:49:30.100,00:49:35.100,00:00:05.000,,yeah all right back on topic
732,7,1,00:49:35.600,00:49:37.400,00:00:01.800,,if we add k
733,7,1,00:49:40.200,00:49:53.900,00:00:13.700,,(laughter) if we added k to each side the left side of the equation would be fourteen negative fourteen because the other side cancels out because the ks cancel out
734,7,1,00:49:54.700,00:49:56.700,00:00:02.000,,and in the other side would be thirty-six
735,7,1,00:49:56.900,00:50:00.000,00:00:03.100,,and then plus two k now that we added another k
736,7,1,00:50:00.500,00:50:02.700,00:00:02.200,,I don't know what that is
737,7,1,00:50:03.700,00:50:08.822,00:00:05.122,,wait I don't know what that is but yeah
738,7,1,00:50:18.000,00:50:19.797,00:00:01.797,only chair,
739,7,1,00:50:24.038,00:50:27.759,00:00:03.721,,all right so I hear my voice echoing
740,7,1,00:50:29.200,00:50:31.500,00:00:02.300,I hear it too,
741,7,1,00:50:32.100,00:50:40.531,00:00:08.431,,all right so now that we have the equation simplify down to a negative fourteen equals thirty-six plus two k
742,7,1,00:50:43.500,00:50:47.582,00:00:04.082,,one minute
743,7,1,00:50:56.700,00:50:57.800,00:00:01.100,,this is confusing
744,7,1,00:51:00.600,00:51:02.481,00:00:01.881,,okay now what we want to do
745,7,1,00:51:04.683,00:51:05.050,00:00:00.367,,is
746,7,1,00:51:15.481,00:51:17.354,00:00:01.873,(inaudible) yourself,
747,7,1,00:51:18.000,00:51:18.600,00:00:00.600,,no
748,7,1,00:51:20.772,00:51:22.000,00:00:01.228,,what do you mean
749,7,1,00:51:22.700,00:51:25.300,00:00:02.600,because you were just never mind,
750,7,1,00:51:26.900,00:51:33.000,00:00:06.100,,okay well
751,7,1,00:51:35.190,00:51:35.683,00:00:00.493,whoops,
752,7,1,00:51:35.200,00:51:41.633,00:00:06.433,,oh no okay I know what to do
753,7,1,00:51:43.038,00:51:46.500,00:00:03.462,,now what we got to do is
754,7,1,00:51:48.500,00:51:52.200,00:00:03.700,,subtract thirty-six from each side
755,7,1,00:51:54.300,00:52:00.300,00:00:06.000,,so then we have so we subtract thirty-six from each side of the equation
756,7,1,00:52:00.700,00:52:04.500,00:00:03.800,,we'll just have two k right here
757,7,1,00:52:05.600,00:52:14.400,00:00:08.800,,and then figure out what negative fourteen minus thirty-one is or thirty-six because then that would be the answer pretty much
758,7,1,00:52:14.600,00:52:17.500,00:00:02.900,,and (inaudible) too but yeah
759,7,1,00:52:17.500,00:52:20.600,00:00:03.100,why are you dropping your Skittles,
760,7,1,00:52:21.600,00:52:22.000,00:00:00.400,,huh
761,7,1,00:52:22.900,00:52:25.300,00:00:02.400,there are Skittles on the table,
762,7,1,00:52:26.800,00:52:29.700,00:00:02.900,,yeah but wouldn't like on the table
763,7,1,00:52:30.200,00:52:30.800,00:00:00.600,yeah,
764,7,1,00:52:32.164,00:52:34.341,00:00:02.177,,not like on the table but in the bag
765,7,1,00:52:35.800,00:52:37.700,00:00:01.900,I heard them go on the table,
766,7,1,00:52:39.000,00:52:39.200,00:00:00.200,,no
767,7,1,00:52:39.200,00:52:41.300,00:00:02.100,,I heard just me getting them out of the bag
768,7,1,00:52:41.900,00:52:43.500,00:00:01.600,,does that sound like that right now
769,7,1,00:52:46.800,00:52:48.900,00:00:02.100,okay there it is,
770,7,1,00:52:47.835,00:52:49.848,00:00:02.013,,yeah I'm just shaking the bag on the table
771,7,1,00:52:52.012,00:52:56.544,00:00:04.532,,okay did you a negative fourteen minus thirty-one
772,7,1,00:52:57.100,00:52:57.900,00:00:00.800,nope,
773,7,1,00:52:58.000,00:52:59.800,00:00:01.800,,all right try to do that
774,7,1,00:53:00.600,00:53:02.300,00:00:01.700,,and then the equation will almost be done
775,7,1,00:53:05.000,00:53:06.300,00:00:01.300,negative thirteen minus,
776,7,1,00:53:06.300,00:53:07.200,00:00:00.900,,or negative fourteen
777,7,1,00:53:07.800,00:53:13.900,00:00:06.100,okay thirty-one,
778,7,1,00:53:13.900,00:53:15.200,00:00:01.300,,minus thirty-six
779,7,1,00:53:16.000,00:53:18.600,00:00:02.600,,my writing is like almost up
780,7,1,00:53:32.300,00:53:33.200,00:00:00.900,wait no sorry,
781,7,1,00:53:33.200,00:53:34.000,00:00:00.800,that's a nine,
782,7,1,00:53:34.000,00:53:36.600,00:00:02.600,,yeah there
783,7,1,00:53:39.025,00:53:40.633,00:00:01.608,I hate when I do that,
784,7,1,00:53:43.000,00:53:45.100,00:00:02.100,,I think they're looking at the testings
785,7,1,00:53:46.900,00:53:47.500,00:00:00.600,,from earlier
786,7,1,00:53:48.721,00:53:50.215,00:00:01.494,,all right did you get it
787,7,1,00:53:51.100,00:53:55.860,00:00:04.760,no okay so let's see here,
788,7,1,00:54:04.101,00:54:05.700,00:00:01.599,,all right because when you get that
789,7,1,00:54:05.700,00:54:08.700,00:00:03.000,,then you just have to divide that by two
790,7,1,00:54:08.700,00:54:11.329,00:00:02.629,,and then the two k divided by oh
791,7,1,00:54:15.300,00:54:15.400,00:00:00.100,,oh
792,7,1,00:54:26.417,00:54:27.278,00:00:00.861,,this looks like the timer
793,7,1,00:54:31.800,00:54:32.200,00:00:00.400,what,
794,7,1,00:54:36.000,00:54:38.000,00:00:02.000,we're done,
795,7,1,00:54:38.600,00:54:38.700,00:00:00.100,,oh
796,7,1,00:54:42.240,00:54:43.126,00:00:00.886,,oh no
797,7,1,00:54:44.860,00:54:45.898,00:00:01.038,,bye
798,7,1,00:54:47.800,00:54:47.900,00:00:00.100,bye,
