00:07:24.014,00:07:41.677,00:00:17.663,,,,,"pause filler there's ten of them to work through there's ten of them to work through and you'll be tutoring your text would be pause filler (inaudible) and so yeah just kind of help them through you want to encircle things but try to avoid solving it for them"
00:07:26.950,00:07:28.799,00:00:01.849,,"no actually don't hold that down",,,
00:07:31.177,00:07:32.374,00:00:01.197,,,"I can't hear that well",,
00:07:32.374,00:07:34.589,00:00:02.215,,,"I just don't hold this",,
00:07:34.589,00:07:36.754,00:00:02.165,,"just don't press the button yeah so put down right",,,
00:07:36.754,00:07:38.830,00:00:02.076,,"so you have about twenty minutes",,,
00:07:39.230,00:07:42.765,00:00:03.535,,"and you'll be working any questions (inaudible)",,,
00:07:44.497,00:07:48.448,00:00:03.951,,,,"is it the questions in the future to do",
00:07:45.444,00:07:47.848,00:00:02.404,,"great you have twenty minutes",,,
00:07:48.448,00:07:49.575,00:00:01.127,,,,,"pause filler they're very similar"
00:07:49.705,00:07:50.653,00:00:00.948,,,,,"they're just different numbers"
00:07:50.653,00:07:54.145,00:00:03.492,,,,,"but like see how x minus blank equals blank"
00:07:54.464,00:08:00.251,00:00:05.787,,,,,"and then this is same thing so different numbers but very similar logic so again pause filler"
00:08:00.251,00:08:05.778,00:00:05.527,,,,,"and yeah you can see yourself there"
00:08:05.778,00:08:07.694,00:00:01.916,,,,,"so just try to make sure you stay within the"
00:08:07.264,00:08:09.009,00:00:01.745,,,,"yeah I don't want to belittle myself (laughter)",
00:08:09.909,00:08:11.027,00:00:01.118,,,,,"well yeah make sure you could stay in there"
00:08:11.027,00:08:12.713,00:00:01.686,,,,,"that we all need that pause filler so again"
00:08:12.713,00:08:13.641,00:00:00.928,,,,,"you're ready to begin"
00:08:14.479,00:08:18.001,00:00:03.522,,,,,"and again just try and solve as many as you can"
00:08:18.001,00:08:24.087,00:00:06.086,,,,,"don't be too worried about this is just an experiment"
00:08:25.005,00:08:28.068,00:00:03.063,,,,,"and I'll be back about twenty minutes and so again"
00:08:28.068,00:08:31.939,00:00:03.871,,,,,"these kind of helps one oh I'm sorry one other thing"
00:08:32.318,00:08:35.511,00:00:03.193,,,,,"pause filler when you're done with this go to the next problems"
00:08:35.511,00:08:37.536,00:00:02.025,,,,,"so you just put click these arrows down here"
00:08:37.706,00:08:40.051,00:00:02.345,,,,"that's twenty problems",
00:08:40.839,00:08:41.817,00:00:00.978,,,,,"pause filler just worry about the first ten"
00:08:41.817,00:08:44.161,00:00:02.344,,,,,"and then the next ten are like something else"
00:08:45.637,00:08:47.833,00:00:02.196,,,,"okay what is oh I have this",
00:08:48.591,00:08:50.347,00:00:01.756,,,,,"all righty pause filler good are you able to draw pause filler"
00:08:51.647,00:08:52.814,00:00:01.167,,,,"I think so",
00:08:54.703,00:08:55.362,00:00:00.659,,,,,"push down"
00:08:55.117,00:08:55.775,00:00:00.658,,,"that was me",,
00:08:55.775,00:08:57.022,00:00:01.247,,,,,"okay yeah so undo"

00:08:58.527,00:09:00.415,00:00:01.888,,,,"oh my god I am not good at this",
00:09:03.876,00:09:07.578,00:00:03.702,,,,,"yeah just think like that's green like I said it's (inaudible)"
00:09:07.407,00:09:07.842,00:00:00.435,,,,"here we go (laughter)",
00:09:10.142,00:09:12.452,00:00:02.310,,,,,"okay so yeah I'll be back in about twenty minutes"

00:09:15.141,00:09:16.500,00:00:01.359,,,"okay teach me",,
00:09:20.628,00:09:23.941,00:00:03.313,,,,"pause filler so do you see the x minus x equals thirteen",
00:09:24.410,00:09:26.405,00:00:01.995,,,"yup I see it same place you are",,
00:09:26.405,00:09:29.443,00:00:03.038,,,,"I'm guessing this is a question we're working on and I thought",
00:09:29.420,00:09:29.880,00:00:00.460,,,"yup",,
00:09:31.743,00:09:33.619,00:00:01.876,,,"pause filler just don't push the button",,
00:09:33.719,00:09:34.796,00:00:01.077,,,"that's all I was told",,
00:09:35.095,00:09:35.295,00:00:00.200,,,,"yeah (laughter)",
00:09:36.344,00:09:37.902,00:00:01.558,,,"okay I'm ready",,
00:09:37.251,00:09:38.228,00:00:00.977,,,,"don't press anything",
00:09:38.228,00:09:39.056,00:00:00.828,,,,"just solve the problem (laughter)",
00:09:42.656,00:09:44.765,00:00:02.109,,,,"so I have no idea how to explain this (laughter)",
00:09:46.084,00:09:48.655,00:00:02.571,,,"it's okay I already kind of understand this so just do your best",,
00:09:49.812,00:09:52.955,00:00:03.143,,,,"what I know and do for this is just do the opposite (laughter)",
00:09:53.700,00:09:53.960,00:00:00.260,,,"ya",,
00:09:54.282,00:09:58.093,00:00:03.811,,,,"so like if you do x minus six this is thirteen plus six that's the answer",
00:09:58.672,00:10:02.533,00:00:03.861,,,"okay like the opposite operation all right should I do this",,
00:10:02.663,00:10:04.120,00:00:01.457,,,"or should you do this",,
00:10:04.120,00:10:04.818,00:00:00.698,,,,"I think you (laughter)",
00:10:04.968,00:10:05.287,00:00:00.319,,,"okay",,
00:10:05.676,00:10:07.859,00:00:02.183,,,,"it's just a thirteen plus six I mean",
00:10:07.948,00:10:13.220,00:00:05.272,,,"this is hard to draw plus six okay",,
00:10:14.620,00:10:15.653,00:00:01.033,,,,"no that is okay",
00:10:17.050,00:10:24.134,00:00:07.084,,,"plus six so that would mean x equal to",,
00:10:26.134,00:10:27.846,00:00:01.712,,,"that was a really bad equal to sign",,
00:10:27.846,00:10:29.472,00:00:01.626,,,"I don't know what that is",,
00:10:30.100,00:10:36.336,00:00:06.236,,,"I'm scared of it okay oh well nineteen",,
00:10:36.775,00:10:42.971,00:00:06.196,,,"that's not a nine one minute okay wait",,
00:10:42.971,00:10:45.276,00:00:02.305,,,"this is confusing",,
00:10:45.875,00:10:49.377,00:00:03.502,,,"okay I think I got it now nineteen",,
00:10:49.377,00:10:51.163,00:00:01.786,,,"there's my sloppy answer",,
00:10:51.771,00:10:55.213,00:00:03.442,,,,"so then you can like double check it by nineteen minus six equals",
00:10:55.762,00:10:58.177,00:00:02.415,,,"yeah that's a good trick okay",,
00:10:58.436,00:11:00.202,00:00:01.766,,,"so I guess we'll move onto the next page now",,
00:11:00.202,00:11:01.260,00:00:01.058,,,,"I suppose",
00:11:01.260,00:11:03.764,00:00:02.504,,,,"so let's see if I can do that while messing out",
00:11:04.223,00:11:05.211,00:00:00.988,,,"okay I'm on it",,
00:11:05.211,00:11:05.789,00:00:00.578,,,"do you see it",,
00:11:05.839,00:11:07.416,00:00:01.577,,,,"yeah I'm trying to get down good",
00:11:07.456,00:11:08.902,00:00:01.446,,,,"I am not good at this",
00:11:09.212,00:11:12.125,00:00:02.913,,,"okay just like okay do you see it",,
00:11:12.125,00:11:17.464,00:00:05.339,,,"fifteen equals negative eight plus p or a q whatever",,
00:11:24.517,00:11:25.235,00:00:00.718,,,,"so (laughter)",
00:11:25.235,00:11:28.099,00:00:02.864,,,"are you on the first page or the second page",,
00:11:28.299,00:11:30.832,00:00:02.533,,,,"second I see fifteen equals minus eight equals p",
00:11:31.301,00:11:31.531,00:00:00.230,,,"okay",,
00:11:34.135,00:11:40.360,00:00:06.225,,,,"so I'm guessing I'll do achy nose achy nose ah ",
00:11:42.060,00:11:49.729,00:00:07.669,,,,"random picky nose so just that like minus eight to each side I think",
00:11:51.580,00:11:53.790,00:00:02.210,,,"oh yeah",,
00:11:53.259,00:11:54.600,00:00:01.341,,,,"that's what it does here",
00:11:54.490,00:11:57.003,00:00:02.513,,,"well at least minus negative eight yeah",,
00:11:57.202,00:12:00.535,00:00:03.333,,,,"yeah so add negative eight to both I suppose",
00:12:01.044,00:12:04.496,00:00:03.452,,,"yeah which is just basically just adding the (inaudible) no right",,
00:12:04.496,00:12:06.052,00:00:01.556,,,,"or no add eight to each",
00:12:06.292,00:12:09.205,00:00:02.913,,,,"because eight minus eight equals eight equals zero so",
00:12:09.694,00:12:14.633,00:00:04.939,,,"so plus yeah because it should not be those like a positive",,
00:12:14.633,00:12:15.281,00:00:00.648,,,"I think",,
00:12:15.840,00:12:16.588,00:00:00.748,,,"I don't know",,
00:12:16.588,00:12:19.711,00:00:03.123,,,,"over or just a regular number plus a negative",
00:12:20.110,00:12:29.429,00:00:09.319,,,"yeah well if you're subtracting wait one second yeah because we're subtracting subtracting negative eight",,
00:12:29.629,00:12:37.271,00:00:07.642,,,"which would make it just adding eight pause filler plus eight plus eight",,
00:12:37.271,00:12:39.546,00:00:02.275,,,,"what did you do to that",
00:12:40.404,00:12:45.243,00:00:04.839,,,"so that would make this side just p",,
00:12:46.431,00:12:50.521,00:00:04.090,,,"and oh jeez this is confusing okay",,
00:12:51.110,00:12:59.671,00:00:08.561,,,"and that would make this side twenty-three right yeah",,
00:13:00.998,00:13:04.239,00:00:03.241,,,,"yeah (laughter) the mental math there for a second",
00:13:04.739,00:13:07.203,00:00:02.464,,,"I'm really bad at it for some reason",,
00:13:07.283,00:13:08.670,00:00:01.387,,,"I need to show me a flash cards",,
00:13:09.019,00:13:10.666,00:00:01.647,,,"okay I'm on page three now",,
00:13:11.035,00:13:12.748,00:00:01.713,,,"I'll wait for you actually okay",,
00:13:16.931,00:13:19.456,00:00:02.525,,,,"so seventeen I think",
00:13:20.373,00:13:21.700,00:00:01.327,,,,"because you're trying to find the k",
00:13:21.940,00:13:24.973,00:00:03.033,,,,"like what plus eleven would equal seventeen",
00:13:25.472,00:13:25.861,00:00:00.389,,,"yeah",,
00:13:26.420,00:13:28.086,00:00:01.666,,,,"so seventeen minus eleven",
00:13:29.144,00:13:29.473,00:00:00.329,,,"okay",,
00:13:29.473,00:13:31.039,00:00:01.566,,,,"then eleven minus eleven",
00:13:31.997,00:13:34.212,00:00:02.215,,,"yeah I would just do",,
00:13:34.212,00:13:36.480,00:00:02.268,,,"you do one side to do on another side ",,
00:13:40.900,00:13:45.935,00:00:05.035,,,"minus eleven to the side equals k",,
00:13:45.935,00:13:49.527,00:00:03.592,,,"that looks like an r oops okay",,
00:13:55.945,00:13:58.597,00:00:02.652,,,,"well it doesn't have to be perfect just it has to have the answer",
00:13:58.786,00:14:01.300,00:00:02.514,,,"yeah okay pause filler I'm sorry",,
00:14:01.350,00:14:03.076,00:00:01.726,,,"I'm a perfectionist I (inaudible)",,
00:14:03.256,00:14:05.665,00:00:02.409,,,,"me too na I am the same",
00:14:05.710,00:14:08.665,00:00:02.955,,,"okay six right okay",,
00:14:09.065,00:14:11.289,00:00:02.224,,,,"yup that's six equals",
00:14:11.358,00:14:13.792,00:00:02.434,,,"oops I skipped too many pages",,
00:14:13.792,00:14:15.758,00:00:01.966,,,"all right I'm on page four",,
00:14:16.456,00:14:17.124,00:00:00.668,,,,"I got it too",
00:14:17.753,00:14:20.816,00:00:03.063,,,"is this like forty-four yeah and this looks to be an x",,
00:14:21.195,00:14:25.046,00:00:03.851,,,,"forty-four x or forty-times one equals",
00:14:25.845,00:14:26.144,00:00:00.299,,,"yeah",,
00:14:26.463,00:14:28.179,00:00:01.716,,,,"wait x stands as a multiplication sign",
00:14:28.179,00:14:30.205,00:00:02.026,,,,"and that the same thing is",
00:14:30.205,00:14:36.520,00:00:06.315,,,"yeah but I'm thinking if in algebra they would use this sign that circle",,
00:14:36.520,00:14:37.468,00:00:00.948,,,,"they don't use a sign",
00:14:37.947,00:14:39.204,00:00:01.257,,,,"they just make you pretty much",
00:14:39.204,00:14:40.621,00:00:01.417,,,,"they put the letters together",
00:14:40.621,00:14:45.300,00:00:04.679,,,,"so that's forty-four x equals forty-time whatever",
00:14:45.300,00:14:50.040,00:00:04.740,,,,"it equal so two hundred and twenty divided by forty-four pretty much",
00:14:50.040,00:14:52.315,00:00:02.275,,,"this is what you want to do okay",,
00:14:52.793,00:14:53.392,00:00:00.599,,,,"I think",
00:14:53.392,00:14:56.295,00:00:02.903,,,"usually (inaudible) like you're teaching me so I'm going to try this I think",,
00:14:56.295,00:14:57.263,00:00:00.968,,,,"I just used the opposite",
00:14:57.263,00:15:00.177,00:00:02.914,,,,"because the opposite of multiplication is division I mean",
00:15:00.177,00:15:03.499,00:00:03.322,,,"yeah but then you have to make sure you're doing it to both sides",,
00:15:03.499,00:15:06.742,00:00:03.243,,,"because the goal is to cancel the variable out",,
00:15:08.358,00:15:13.307,00:00:04.949,,,"so I don't think I know this this is depressing",,
00:15:17.607,00:15:18.755,00:00:01.148,,,"I'm going to have to write this out",,
00:15:19.255,00:15:20.600,00:00:01.345,,,,"I can help you if you want I mean",
00:15:20.638,00:15:23.054,00:00:02.416,,,"okay you want to do the whole division",,
00:15:23.554,00:15:27.475,00:00:03.921,,,"that's my weakness for all things",,
00:15:27.475,00:15:29.051,00:00:01.576,,,"like I'm good with concepts",,
00:15:29.051,00:15:31.964,00:00:02.913,,,"but like computation I'm slow at it",,
00:15:32.564,00:15:34.868,00:00:02.304,,,,"oh my gosh I suck at writing this thing",
00:15:35.437,00:15:36.600,00:00:01.163,,,"yeah it's kind of hard",,
00:15:51.751,00:15:55.042,00:00:03.291,,,,"(laughter) oh so pretty much forty-four will go and not going to do",
00:15:55.172,00:15:57.397,00:00:02.225,,,,"forty-four wouldn't go into twenty-two so",
00:15:57.836,00:15:59.392,00:00:01.556,,,"yeah you got to do it",,
00:15:59.392,00:16:00.240,00:00:00.848,,,,"zero equals",
00:16:00.240,00:16:01.427,00:00:01.187,,,"two twenty",,
00:16:02.427,00:16:03.010,00:00:00.583,,,,"zero",
00:16:04.710,00:16:05.807,00:00:01.097,,,,"where is the calculator (laughter)",
00:16:07.000,00:16:09.828,00:00:02.828,,,"I don't know wait there's a bunch of other tools",,
00:16:09.828,00:16:11.784,00:00:01.956,,,"but we weren't told what those are",,
00:16:11.784,00:16:14.847,00:00:03.063,,,"so I'm guessing we're not supposed to use this",,
00:16:14.877,00:16:18.564,00:00:03.687,,,,"I wonder if I'm allowed to use this scratch paper",
00:16:20.364,00:16:24.506,00:00:04.142,,,"pause filler I don't know (inaudible) I'm pretty sure they want us to do it on the screen",,
00:16:24.985,00:16:25.752,00:00:00.767,,,,"I know this is hard",
00:16:26.321,00:16:27.700,00:00:01.379,,,"to stay for later",,
00:16:28.001,00:16:28.797,00:00:00.796,,,,"so they're coming",
00:16:30.997,00:16:32.638,00:00:01.641,,,"ya I will think on it too",,
00:16:33.040,00:16:33.770,00:00:00.730,,,,"eighty-eight",
00:16:40.489,00:16:42.056,00:00:01.567,,,"hey that's forty-four",,
00:16:45.356,00:16:49.897,00:00:04.541,,,"yeah use your pause filler actual pen like you can",,
00:16:50.570,00:16:51.140,00:00:00.570,,,,"yeah",
00:17:08.697,00:17:09.700,00:00:01.003,,,,"one twenty-two",
00:17:17.500,00:17:25.965,00:00:08.465,,,,"nope that's twenty-five I think",
00:17:25.965,00:17:26.165,00:00:00.200,,,"okay",,
00:17:26.815,00:17:29.158,00:00:02.343,,,,"I'm looking for an assembly in this thing",
00:17:29.940,00:17:30.310,00:00:00.370,,,"okay",,
00:17:34.137,00:17:37.858,00:00:03.721,,,,"okay yeah currently we're doing it right pause filler (laughter)",
00:17:37.958,00:17:39.864,00:00:01.906,,,"okay pause filler I can't tell if I'm in the frame",,
00:17:39.864,00:17:43.994,00:00:04.130,,,"because there's a warning sign like covering me up",,
00:17:43.994,00:17:45.860,00:00:01.866,,,"so sorry if you can't see me",,
00:17:45.860,00:17:46.848,00:00:00.988,,,,"yeah you're right in the middle",
00:17:46.848,00:17:47.646,00:00:00.798,,,,"so am I",
00:17:47.646,00:17:49.382,00:00:01.736,,,"okay good yeah you're good",,
00:17:49.382,00:17:54.259,00:00:04.877,,,,"cool I might need over here a little bit but that's just because I'm looking at those",
00:17:54.270,00:17:54.540,00:00:00.270,,,"okay",,
00:17:55.169,00:18:02.582,00:00:07.413,,,,"so yeah like do you think what I have is like twelve y twelve y equals twenty-four so",
00:18:02.582,00:18:04.907,00:00:02.325,,,,"and I'm just going twelve over twelve",
00:18:04.907,00:18:07.371,00:00:02.464,,,"yeah that's like basically what ours is",,
00:18:09.087,00:18:12.240,00:00:03.153,,,"so do we do it right so far at least the dividing by forty-four",,
00:18:12.559,00:18:12.809,00:00:00.250,,,,"yeah",
00:18:13.410,00:18:13.680,00:00:00.270,,,"okay",,
00:18:14.538,00:18:18.027,00:00:03.489,,,,"that's just pretty much how many time forty-four I can go with that",
00:18:18.576,00:18:26.149,00:00:07.573,,,"okay okay so forty-four plus forty-four it's eighty-eight and then eighty-eight",,
00:18:26.528,00:18:27.994,00:00:01.466,,,"that's forty-four",,
00:18:28.553,00:18:30.389,00:00:01.836,,,"is there a faster way to do this",,
00:18:30.518,00:18:32.861,00:00:02.343,,,,"I wish calculator up (laughter)",
00:18:33.861,00:18:34.450,00:00:00.589,,,"yeah",,
00:18:40.450,00:18:43.978,00:00:03.528,,,,"one seventy-six equals forty-four",
00:18:45.395,00:18:46.941,00:00:01.546,,,"here okay",,
00:18:49.029,00:18:50.503,00:00:01.474,,,,"another four so far so",
00:18:51.461,00:18:53.995,00:00:02.534,,,"okay yeah you're closer than I am",,
00:18:53.995,00:18:55.711,00:00:01.716,,,"so I guess I'll wait",,
00:19:06.437,00:19:06.914,00:00:00.477,,,,"I got it",
00:19:07.683,00:19:09.211,00:00:01.528,,,"yeah okay how much is it",,
00:19:09.600,00:19:12.683,00:00:03.083,,,,"so for me I just want the (inaudible) though (laughter)",
00:19:13.883,00:19:15.241,00:00:01.358,,,"okay what do you",,
00:19:29.041,00:19:31.122,00:00:02.081,,,,"so I think it's either five or six ",
00:19:32.060,00:19:32.320,00:00:00.260,,,"hmm",,
00:19:33.600,00:19:34.230,00:00:00.630,,,,"I'm fine with",
00:19:34.322,00:19:36.068,00:00:01.746,,,"ya one seems more reasonable",,
00:19:40.051,00:19:40.569,00:00:00.518,,,,"five",
00:19:40.998,00:19:48.521,00:00:07.523,,,"okay so five go right here and how many five times was it exactly",,
00:19:49.919,00:19:52.832,00:00:02.913,,,"do you remember what five times forty-four was",,
00:19:53.620,00:19:54.998,00:00:01.378,,,,"I'm double-checking that now",
00:19:55.260,00:19:55.620,00:00:00.360,,,"okay",,
00:20:08.598,00:20:09.995,00:00:01.397,,,,"it sounds like it",
00:20:20.768,00:20:25.158,00:00:04.390,,,"you do write it down as we're doing the problem is what I'm asking",,
00:20:25.158,00:20:27.892,00:00:02.734,,,"and did it fit into it exactly",,
00:20:27.892,00:20:30.855,00:00:02.963,,,"because if it did then it's two hundred and twenty",,
00:20:31.164,00:20:33.659,00:00:02.495,,,,"because I just went like forty-four (inaudible) pause filler",
00:20:38.588,00:20:41.022,00:00:02.434,,,,"yeah I need to talk",
00:20:41.401,00:20:45.093,00:00:03.692,,,,"oh add twenty-five great job",
00:20:45.791,00:20:47.218,00:00:01.427,,,"there we go it's back",,
00:20:47.617,00:20:50.670,00:00:03.053,,,,"so I just went like forty-four plus forty-four equals eighty-eight",
00:20:50.750,00:20:53.124,00:00:02.374,,,,"so I want eighty-eight plus eighty-eight which would be four",
00:20:53.124,00:20:54.731,00:00:01.607,,,,"then I added another forty-four so",
00:20:54.731,00:21:03.541,00:00:08.810,,,"so the fifth one the fifth forty-four that you added what you end up with was that exactly two hundred and twenty",,
00:21:04.349,00:21:05.746,00:00:01.397,,,,"yeah I'm still checking it now one sec",
00:21:05.746,00:21:11.223,00:00:05.477,,,"okay because if it was then we can just write two hundred twenty",,
00:21:11.223,00:21:12.999,00:00:01.776,,,"and then you're left with no remainder",,
00:21:12.999,00:21:16.272,00:00:03.273,,,"and so your answer is that's",,
00:21:16.691,00:21:17.853,00:00:01.162,,,"I don't know what I did",,
00:21:21.081,00:21:26.888,00:00:05.807,,,"so then the answer would be five if it if it fits exactly is what I'm saying",,
00:21:26.588,00:21:27.384,00:00:00.796,,,,"I think it's five",
00:21:28.384,00:21:31.218,00:00:02.834,,,"yeah because you'd subtract this",,
00:21:31.268,00:21:32.365,00:00:01.097,,,"I don't know what I'm doing",,
00:21:32.365,00:21:35.059,00:00:02.694,,,,"I keep messing up on pens my pen",
00:21:35.957,00:21:40.956,00:00:04.999,,,"okay so that one would be five right yeah",,
00:21:40.956,00:21:45.605,00:00:04.649,,,,"x equals five maybe (laughter) we hope",
00:21:47.205,00:21:48.469,00:00:01.264,,," let's just move on",,
00:21:55.448,00:22:06.010,00:00:10.562,,,"okay I think I get how to do this just tell me like what comes to mind or what how you would explain how to do it",,
00:22:06.570,00:22:09.310,00:00:02.740,,,,"I'm trying to find the specific thing over here ",
00:22:09.370,00:22:09.960,00:00:00.590,,,"okay",,
00:22:13.373,00:22:14.110,00:00:00.737,,,"oh my gosh",,
00:22:20.649,00:22:31.990,00:00:11.341,,,,"okay so (inaudible) so we can start this problem",
00:22:32.120,00:22:33.753,00:00:01.633,,,,"I have no clue what I'm doing",
00:22:37.542,00:22:45.619,00:00:08.077,,,"I am not I don't know if I'm supposed to help you or like if I know it I don't know if I'm supposed to help you or wait until I'm tutoring you",,
00:22:46.419,00:22:47.207,00:00:00.788,,,"I'm not sure",,
00:22:46.507,00:22:47.664,00:00:01.157,,,,"right now I'm tutoring you",
00:22:47.664,00:22:49.370,00:00:01.706,,,,"so I guess I know what I'm doing",
00:22:49.460,00:22:53.890,00:00:04.430,,,"yeah so I guess I'll just listen hands off",,
00:22:55.496,00:22:58.799,00:00:03.303,,,,"I'm trying to solve it my mind first to see if I get it that's all",
00:22:58.959,00:23:02.411,00:00:03.452,,,"yeah well you can write it down as you go if you want",,
00:23:02.411,00:23:04.985,00:00:02.574,,,,"like I don't think there's anything wrong with that",
00:23:12.785,00:23:15.291,00:00:02.506,,,,"I have memorial theme songs stuck on my hand",
00:23:15.291,00:23:16.608,00:00:01.317,,,"I know I feel like coming",,
00:23:16.608,00:23:20.220,00:00:03.612,,,"and I'm like wait everyone there's a mic on me",,
00:23:20.460,00:23:21.457,00:00:00.997,,,"I probably shouldn't",,
00:23:27.484,00:23:31.973,00:00:04.489,,,,"so I guess you'd have to cross cancel the negative number",
00:23:32.452,00:23:32.851,00:00:00.399,,,"yeah",,
00:23:33.839,00:23:37.670,00:00:03.831,,,,"so like minus nine plus nine and then forty-one plus nine",
00:23:39.399,00:23:39.777,00:00:00.378,,,"okay",,
00:23:42.937,00:23:43.236,00:00:00.299,,,,"maybe",
00:23:43.936,00:23:45.969,00:00:02.033,,,"so you want to write that or do you want me to",,
00:23:47.169,00:23:48.466,00:00:01.297,,,,"pause filler you because you're a lot better at this (laughter)",
00:23:48.586,00:23:49.953,00:00:01.367,,,,"you're a lot better at writing",
00:23:49.953,00:23:53.275,00:00:03.322,,,"okay so you say what do you want me to write again",,
00:23:53.275,00:23:56.218,00:00:02.943,,,,"it's like cross cancel this one",
00:23:56.268,00:23:58.683,00:00:02.415,,,"so cancel out the negative nine is what you're saying",,
00:23:58.683,00:23:59.690,00:00:01.007,,,,"yeah pretty much",
00:23:59.690,00:24:12.302,00:00:12.612,,,"okay so you would do add negative nine and you have to do that to each side right",,
00:24:12.702,00:24:13.529,00:00:00.827,,,,"I think",
00:24:14.946,00:24:16.040,00:00:01.094,,,"I'm sorry I don't want to like",,
00:24:16.110,00:24:16.888,00:00:00.778,,,,"I'm looking at them",
00:24:22.888,00:24:26.046,00:00:03.158,,,"okay now what does it say to do or what do you want me to do",,
00:24:27.946,00:24:36.198,00:00:08.252,,,,"I guess when you kind of divide because you're doing thirteen p which is thirteen times p",
00:24:36.307,00:24:38.023,00:00:01.716,,,"yeah so",,
00:24:38.093,00:24:46.714,00:00:08.621,,,,"it's like divided by five or for us it would be thirteen so forty-one divided by thirteen and thirteen divided thirteen",
00:24:46.714,00:24:48.280,00:00:01.566,,,"I'm trying to write on this",,
00:24:50.724,00:24:53.398,00:00:02.674,,,"so that's thats yeah okay",,
00:24:54.646,00:24:56.721,00:00:02.075,,,"so we should probably do this",,
00:24:57.970,00:25:00.523,00:00:02.553,,,"because I wrote it down but we didn't actually do it",,
00:25:00.772,00:25:06.030,00:00:05.258,,,"so we're left with thirteen oh my gosh",,
00:25:11.330,00:25:14.530,00:00:03.200,,,"so after we do the first step you told me to do",,
00:25:14.750,00:25:26.914,00:00:12.164,,,"I get thirteen p equals forty-one after that we were six",,
00:25:26.763,00:25:29.347,00:00:02.584,,,,"well you have to add nine to forty-one",
00:25:29.456,00:25:31.451,00:00:01.995,,,,"so that would technically be fifty now",
00:25:32.051,00:25:34.030,00:00:01.979,,,"oh right you're right I forgot to do that",,
00:25:39.573,00:25:50.838,00:00:11.265,,,"see this is what tutors are for it remind you skip something yeah so I'm adding negative nine which is basically just subtracting nine right",,
00:25:51.796,00:25:53.592,00:00:01.796,,,,"well you're adding nine",
00:25:53.592,00:25:56.864,00:00:03.272,,,,"because minus nine wouldn't if you subtracted it it would be",
00:25:58.351,00:25:59.538,00:00:01.187,,,"so you want me to add nine",,
00:25:59.568,00:26:03.220,00:00:03.652,,,,"minus fifteen so minus nine plus nine and then forty-one plus nine",
00:26:03.709,00:26:04.337,00:00:00.628,,,"so fifty",,

00:35:05.128,00:35:13.170,00:00:08.042,,,"okay should I pause filler like should I tell her like what to do and have her like solve it or",,
00:35:13.409,00:35:14.517,00:00:01.108,,,"I'm not really sure",,
00:35:14.517,00:35:15.345,00:00:00.828,,"that's up to you",,,
00:35:15.345,00:35:17.640,00:00:02.295,,"so you tutor her however you feel comfortable",,,
00:35:17.640,00:35:20.832,00:00:03.192,,"pause filler but you cannot just give her the answers",,,
00:35:20.832,00:35:23.060,00:00:02.228,,"tell her how you learn and understand how to do it",,,
00:35:23.100,00:35:23.390,00:00:00.290,,,"ya",,
00:35:24.090,00:35:24.470,00:00:00.380,,"okay",,,
00:35:24.530,00:35:24.950,00:00:00.420,,,"okay",,
00:35:26.106,00:35:28.478,00:00:02.372,,"so (inaudible) take about fifteen to twenty minutes",,,
00:35:28.478,00:35:28.837,00:00:00.359,,,"okay",,
00:35:32.337,00:35:40.168,00:00:07.831,,,"okay so pause filler what you always want to make sure is that the variable is on one side",,
00:35:40.168,00:35:42.234,00:00:02.066,,,"because it just makes it easier",,
00:35:42.294,00:35:46.384,00:00:04.090,,,"and I always split it down the middle on the equals sign like that",,
00:35:47.584,00:35:48.180,00:00:00.596,,,"I don't know why",,
00:35:48.350,00:35:52.391,00:00:04.041,,,"it just makes it easier to like know what to do to one side (inaudible)",,
00:35:52.431,00:35:58.457,00:00:06.026,,,"and so what would your first guess be when you want to do this",,
00:35:59.465,00:36:01.650,00:00:02.185,,,"because they said not to give you the answers",,
00:36:01.799,00:36:03.386,00:00:01.587,,,"so I don't want to just do it",,
00:36:03.605,00:36:05.145,00:00:01.540,,,,"I'm just working on my head that's all",
00:36:05.470,00:36:05.900,00:00:00.430,,,"okay",,
00:36:11.896,00:36:12.106,00:00:00.210,,,"yeah",,
00:36:14.151,00:36:16.576,00:00:02.425,,,,"oh not even touching my thing what is going on",

00:36:19.060,00:36:19.615,00:00:00.555,,,,"why is it typing",
00:36:19.615,00:36:23.487,00:00:03.872,,,"yeah it might do that if you're hovering over it I'm not sure",,
00:36:24.787,00:36:26.134,00:00:01.347,,,,"oh if you press these buttons I get it",
00:36:26.324,00:36:27.850,00:00:01.526,,,"okay wait a minute I'm sorry",,
00:36:27.850,00:36:29.526,00:00:01.676,,,"I undoed everything",,
00:36:29.526,00:36:31.248,00:00:01.722,,,,"it's fine I don't know it anyway",
00:36:34.365,00:36:36.720,00:00:02.355,,,,"I don't know if you cork this button",
00:36:36.720,00:36:37.518,00:00:00.798,,,"so basically",,
00:36:37.518,00:36:37.977,00:00:00.459,,,,"ah I could not",
00:36:38.376,00:36:40.561,00:00:02.185,,,"I'm pretty sure you have the right idea",,
00:36:40.561,00:36:43.973,00:00:03.412,,,"because I could kind of hear you working it out",,
00:36:43.973,00:36:45.031,00:00:01.058,,,,"my pen is writing",
00:36:49.531,00:36:53.291,00:00:03.760,,,,"oh hit the button people used to (inaudible) again",
00:36:53.760,00:36:54.080,00:00:00.320,,,"ya",,
00:36:54.829,00:36:55.648,00:00:00.819,,,,"well at least not",
00:37:00.067,00:37:01.534,00:00:01.467,,,"pause filler it's not working for me either",,
00:37:02.534,00:37:03.866,00:00:01.332,,,,"I don't understand",
00:37:04.566,00:37:08.000,00:00:03.434,,,"oh well you know what I think it's something",,
00:37:09.106,00:37:11.261,00:00:02.155,,,"just ignore it yeah",,
00:37:11.971,00:37:14.754,00:00:02.783,,,,"and cross goodbye I don't want you",
00:37:15.754,00:37:19.065,00:00:03.311,,,,"so minus three plus three equals zero (laughter)",
00:37:20.065,00:37:25.579,00:00:05.514,,,,"twenty-five plus three equals twenty-five twenty-five plus three half",
00:37:26.429,00:37:32.109,00:00:05.680,,,,"so now what so that would be x equals no no",
00:37:32.209,00:37:34.249,00:00:02.040,,,"how about you add it out like step by step",,
00:37:34.309,00:37:35.516,00:00:01.207,,,"that might help",,
00:37:35.975,00:37:37.073,00:00:01.098,,,"it's what I always do",,
00:37:38.839,00:37:48.866,00:00:10.027,,,"so the goal is to try to cancel out pause filler all of the like coefficient yeah the coefficient which is",,
00:37:50.133,00:37:54.094,00:00:03.961,,,"basically you want to cancel out all the constants on this side",,
00:37:54.284,00:37:58.174,00:00:03.890,,,"and then yeah that's basically what you want to do",,
00:37:58.674,00:38:02.285,00:00:03.611,,,,"so minus three would have to disappear",
00:38:02.285,00:38:04.311,00:00:02.026,,,,"so minus three plus three equals zero",
00:38:04.720,00:38:06.905,00:00:02.185,,,,"twenty-five plus three equals twenty-five",
00:38:07.095,00:38:09.429,00:00:02.334,,,,"twenty-five why did you say twenty-five plus twenty-five well no",
00:38:09.649,00:38:10.736,00:00:01.087,,,"no twenty-two (laughter)",,
00:38:11.236,00:38:12.223,00:00:00.987,,,,"eight equals twenty-five",
00:38:12.223,00:38:13.022,00:00:00.799,,,,"that's all right now",
00:38:13.052,00:38:17.072,00:00:04.020,,,"okay so you're saying x equals what",,
00:38:17.790,00:38:18.668,00:00:00.878,,,,"twenty-five yeah because",
00:38:19.407,00:38:20.983,00:00:01.576,,,"twenty-five let me put that",,
00:38:21.093,00:38:24.575,00:00:03.482,,,,"then you can add twenty-five plus minus three which would be yeah",
00:38:24.984,00:38:27.937,00:00:02.953,,,"yeah wait one second (inaudible) out of my head",,
00:38:27.937,00:38:30.012,00:00:02.075,,,,"oh what did I do",
00:38:30.012,00:38:31.200,00:00:01.188,,,"do you want me oh",,
00:38:31.200,00:38:32.417,00:00:01.217,,,"I'm trying to write it",,
00:38:32.417,00:38:33.384,00:00:00.967,,,"but it's not working",,
00:38:34.712,00:38:42.678,00:00:07.966,,,,"let me try no no press the button oh my god that is the worst thing I've ever done",
00:38:43.078,00:38:44.810,00:00:01.732,,,,"and that says a lot about my handwriting",
00:38:46.280,00:38:47.220,00:00:00.940,,,,"twenty-five",
00:38:48.110,00:38:50.207,00:00:02.097,,,"there you can tell it's okay",,
00:38:52.007,00:38:54.357,00:00:02.350,,,,"yay no next one I suppose",
00:38:56.233,00:39:02.439,00:00:06.206,,,"okay so same thing go down the middle",,
00:39:03.187,00:39:04.524,00:00:01.337,,,"try to get",,
00:39:04.734,00:39:14.152,00:00:09.418,,,"cancel out all the pause filler numbers or I guess anything that's not a variable on this side",,
00:39:14.152,00:39:16.686,00:00:02.534,,,"wait you call those constants right yeah constants",,
00:39:16.686,00:39:17.224,00:00:00.538,,,,"I think so",
00:39:17.512,00:39:20.218,00:00:02.706,,,"yeah constants and variables",,
00:39:28.871,00:39:30.424,00:00:01.553,,,,"so we'd have to get rid of eighteen",
00:39:31.622,00:39:32.680,00:00:01.058,,,,"eighteen's got to go",
00:39:33.059,00:39:37.898,00:00:04.839,,,"yeah so the opposite operation so eighteen is being added which means you were",,
00:39:37.898,00:39:40.363,00:00:02.465,,,,"so eighteen minus eighteen equals zero",
00:39:40.772,00:39:45.441,00:00:04.669,,,,"twenty-five minus eighteen equals five",
00:39:46.030,00:39:47.476,00:00:01.446,,,"okay so",,
00:39:50.140,00:39:51.767,00:00:01.627,,,,"so yeah it would be five",
00:39:51.767,00:39:54.131,00:00:02.364,,,,"plus twenty-three minus eighteen equals five",
00:39:54.790,00:40:00.716,00:00:05.926,,,"so five and I certain times like draw it on the line like that",,
00:40:01.516,00:40:02.952,00:00:01.436,,,"I don't know why I do that",,
00:40:03.290,00:40:05.525,00:00:02.235,,,"it's like so then to the two sides too",,
00:40:05.525,00:40:12.428,00:00:06.903,,,,"okay so eighteen minus eight eighteen or (laughter) I can't talk",
00:40:13.976,00:40:15.203,00:00:01.227,,,"so you said five",,
00:40:15.203,00:40:17.608,00:00:02.405,,,"I guess I don't know what a negative y would be",,
00:40:17.608,00:40:19.224,00:00:01.616,,,"I guess it just be negative y",,
00:40:19.274,00:40:22.387,00:00:03.113,,,"like I don't know if you have to do anything like that",,
00:40:22.387,00:40:23.504,00:00:01.117,,,"I guess it's done",,
00:40:30.110,00:40:30.289,00:00:00.179,,,,"so (inaudible)",
00:40:30.389,00:40:32.334,00:00:01.945,,,"are you on page three",,
00:40:32.674,00:40:33.402,00:00:00.728,,,,"yup",
00:40:33.402,00:40:37.014,00:00:03.612,,,"I'm confused okay let me see",,
00:40:38.121,00:40:46.859,00:00:08.738,,,"wait a minute okay it's not as bad as I think there's just a lot of negatives so oh okay",,
00:40:47.189,00:40:51.195,00:00:04.006,,,"so the other side you want me the variable on one side",,
00:40:51.680,00:40:52.030,00:00:00.350,,,,"yeah",
00:40:53.004,00:41:02.187,00:00:09.183,,,"so to do that you have to what the sheet said is that you have to add",,
00:41:02.187,00:41:04.900,00:00:02.713,,,"so see at once negative or one is a positive",,
00:41:06.018,00:41:11.595,00:00:05.577,,,"so let's say if you add one to each side you cannot see that",,
00:41:11.645,00:41:14.339,00:00:02.694,,,"but oh well you add one to each side",,
00:41:16.235,00:41:19.507,00:00:03.272,,,"then that's cancelling out this one",,
00:41:20.106,00:41:26.781,00:00:06.675,,,"pause filler right here that's right yeah oh it's cancelling out this one",,
00:41:26.781,00:41:28.776,00:00:01.995,,,"so this is like comes zero",,
00:41:28.776,00:41:29.674,00:00:00.898,,,"it's nothing",,
00:41:30.323,00:41:33.785,00:00:03.462,,,"it's just fourteen now",,
00:41:35.142,00:41:42.285,00:00:07.143,,,"pause filler and then this one becomes two okay and then you do it from there",,
00:41:42.285,00:41:44.590,00:00:02.305,,,"so I'm going to write out the problem for you now",,
00:41:44.720,00:41:45.788,00:00:01.068,,,"because it's all messy",,
00:41:46.795,00:41:54.625,00:00:07.830,,,"so fourteen equals thirty-six plus two",,
00:41:55.625,00:41:57.002,00:00:01.377,,,"okay so you solve that",,
00:42:01.572,00:42:03.534,00:00:01.962,,,,"should two be multiplied by k",
00:42:04.534,00:42:07.648,00:00:03.114,,,"right now it's being multiplied by k yes so",,
00:42:09.248,00:42:20.638,00:00:11.390,,,,"I don't know how anything multiplied by how it would have to be a negative number because you'd have to kind of get fourteen out of thirty-six",
00:42:21.776,00:42:24.539,00:00:02.763,,,"yeah do you want me to split down the middle for you",,
00:42:24.539,00:42:26.066,00:00:01.527,,,"I don't know if that helps you",,
00:42:26.066,00:42:27.373,00:00:01.307,,,"but it helps me",,
00:42:28.750,00:42:30.397,00:00:01.647,,,"sorry if it doesn't help you",,
00:42:31.497,00:42:42.219,00:00:10.722,,,"it's like I always just choose a random start so you can either start out thirty-six or start at two k",,
00:42:42.969,00:42:47.058,00:00:04.089,,,"but either way you're trying to cancel out all of the constants",,
00:42:48.058,00:42:52.765,00:00:04.707,,,"so we start at two k two it's being multiplied by k",,
00:42:53.154,00:42:58.003,00:00:04.849,,,"and so you would do the opposite pause filler operation",,
00:42:58.582,00:43:00.407,00:00:01.825,,,,"so fourteen divided by two",
00:43:00.507,00:43:00.847,00:00:00.340,,,"huh",,
00:43:01.186,00:43:02.204,00:00:01.018,,,,"so fourteen divided by two",
00:43:02.493,00:43:02.980,00:00:00.487,,,"yes",,
00:43:07.380,00:43:09.130,00:00:01.750,,,"fourteen divided by two",,
00:43:09.430,00:43:09.918,00:00:00.488,,,,"seven",
00:43:11.068,00:43:12.032,00:00:00.964,,,"seven okay",,
00:43:12.471,00:43:12.870,00:00:00.399,,,,"seven",
00:43:14.476,00:43:15.873,00:00:01.397,,,"I think I'm writing all this",,
00:43:15.873,00:43:16.970,00:00:01.097,,,"but you're still doing the work",,
00:43:16.970,00:43:18.926,00:00:01.956,,,"so I don't want them to think I was doing all this",,
00:43:18.926,00:43:21.330,00:00:02.404,,,"because you're telling me this what to write down",,
00:43:21.330,00:43:23.264,00:00:01.934,,,,"no I'm just really bad at writing that's all",
00:43:23.294,00:43:26.100,00:00:02.806,,,"yeah I dont want I dont yeah",,
00:43:26.529,00:43:29.116,00:00:02.587,,,,"so they know what we are do i think I hope",
00:43:29.216,00:43:33.982,00:00:04.766,,,"yeah I just don't want to watch this and (inaudible) and be like oh that girl didn't teach her anything",,
00:43:33.982,00:43:37.623,00:00:03.641,,,"she just did all the work all right",,
00:43:37.903,00:43:40.407,00:00:02.504,,,"so seven and what would the other side be",,
00:43:45.565,00:43:46.773,00:00:01.208,,,,"pause filler minus seven maybe",
00:43:46.873,00:43:51.612,00:00:04.739,,,"oh wait why did I degrade at seven oh wait because it is seven sorry",,
00:43:52.670,00:43:56.081,00:00:03.411,,,,"I just don't get how anything plus thirty-six can equal fourteen",
00:43:56.600,00:43:56.850,00:00:00.250,,,"huh",,
00:43:57.079,00:43:57.638,00:00:00.559,,,,"unless it's negative",
00:43:57.638,00:43:59.623,00:00:01.985,,,"yeah so the entire thing is like",,
00:44:00.052,00:44:02.287,00:00:02.235,,,"that's what I want to think about logically",,
00:44:02.287,00:44:07.795,00:00:05.508,,,"but sometimes like pause filler you can if you just follow like the rules",,
00:44:07.795,00:44:14.629,00:00:06.834,,,"and you understand the rules gonna help but we all have different ways of thinking like some people are just like this is the rule and you follow this",,
00:44:14.669,00:44:18.331,00:00:03.662,,,"and we're like well logically that doesn't make sense like that's like",,
00:44:18.331,00:44:21.563,00:00:03.232,,,"I was like well logically like when I was writing negatives and stuff",,
00:44:21.563,00:44:23.120,00:00:01.557,,,"I was like logically it would be this",,
00:44:23.120,00:44:25.654,00:00:02.534,,,"and then they're like nope because this rules is this",,
00:44:25.654,00:44:26.802,00:00:01.148,,,"so it actually will be this",,
00:44:27.789,00:44:30.922,00:00:03.133,,,"yeah so there are stuff like this",,
00:44:30.922,00:44:31.890,00:00:00.968,,,"I just follow",,
00:44:31.890,00:44:33.506,00:00:01.616,,,"I have the certain set of rules",,
00:44:33.506,00:44:37.298,00:00:03.792,,,"and I follow them and that is what you do to one side you do to the other",,
00:44:37.986,00:44:44.062,00:00:06.076,,,"so we divided fourteen by two",,
00:44:44.062,00:44:45.569,00:00:01.507,,,"so I divide this by two",,
00:44:46.168,00:44:48.253,00:00:02.085,,,"pause filler I messed something up",,
00:44:53.023,00:44:54.459,00:00:01.436,,,,"what would be two divided by two",
00:44:54.638,00:44:55.048,00:00:00.410,,,"huh",,
00:44:55.448,00:44:57.751,00:00:02.303,,,,"two divided by two would equal to zero so fourteen divided two",
00:44:57.751,00:45:01.154,00:00:03.403,,,"yeah two divided two so which means we're just left with",,
00:45:01.154,00:45:03.798,00:00:02.644,,,"yeah we're just left with seven equals",,
00:45:03.446,00:45:04.055,00:00:00.609,,,,"thirty-six",
00:45:04.255,00:45:07.566,00:00:03.311,,,"thirty-six but we still have plus k",,
00:45:08.666,00:45:11.490,00:00:02.824,,,"because we just cancelled out the two we didn't cancel out the k",,
00:45:13.156,00:45:18.315,00:00:05.159,,,,"so we have to get one of this thirty-six or seven",
00:45:19.013,00:45:21.777,00:00:02.764,,,"no thirty-six because seven yeah",,
00:45:22.305,00:45:28.042,00:00:05.737,,,,"so thirty-six minus thirty-six equals zero so seven minus thirty-six",
00:45:28.611,00:45:30.247,00:00:01.636,,,"yup exactly",,
00:45:32.432,00:45:34.700,00:00:02.268,,,,"well equal minus twenty-nine",
00:45:34.990,00:45:35.330,00:00:00.340,,,"hmm",,
00:45:35.775,00:45:36.643,00:00:00.868,,,,"negative twenty-nine",
00:45:36.902,00:45:39.099,00:00:02.197,,,"yup so negative",,
00:45:39.159,00:45:40.525,00:00:01.366,,,,"negative twenty-nine equals k",
00:45:40.993,00:45:42.061,00:00:01.068,,,"yup we did it",,
00:45:42.140,00:45:43.447,00:00:01.307,,,"I don't think we really have to write it out",,
00:45:43.497,00:45:45.493,00:00:01.996,,,"pause filler let's do let's write that out",,
00:45:46.111,00:45:51.360,00:00:05.249,,,"negative twenty-nine equals pause filler k oh well",,
00:45:53.360,00:45:56.173,00:00:02.813,,,"k oh well",,
00:45:58.073,00:45:59.850,00:00:01.777,,,"okay are you on page four",,
00:45:59.894,00:46:00.013,00:00:00.119,,,,"yup",
00:46:00.334,00:46:03.310,00:00:02.976,,,"okay so",,
00:46:05.010,00:46:16.553,00:00:11.543,,,"this is this is like very similar so last time when we want the variables on one side last time when they were on two sides do you remember what we did",,
00:46:17.380,00:46:17.560,00:00:00.180,,,,"yeah",
00:46:18.338,00:46:20.290,00:00:01.952,,,"yeah so",,
00:46:21.690,00:46:23.279,00:00:01.589,,,"you do you want me to write it",,
00:46:23.379,00:46:25.282,00:00:01.903,,,,"yeah you're better at writing it I'm not good",
00:46:25.282,00:46:29.044,00:00:03.762,,,"okay so what shall we do first",,
00:46:30.081,00:46:31.349,00:00:01.268,,,,"we get rid of the p",
00:46:32.436,00:46:35.100,00:00:02.664,,,"yeah by canceling it out",,
00:46:36.100,00:46:40.518,00:00:04.418,,,"adding b but what we do to one side we have to do it to the next",,
00:46:40.797,00:46:42.862,00:00:02.065,,,,"so b plus b equals b (laughter)",
00:46:43.840,00:46:48.769,00:00:04.929,,,"so let's just pause filler write it out again over here",,
00:46:49.437,00:47:03.775,00:00:14.338,,,"so seven seventeen sorry equals eighteen plus two b",,
00:47:04.044,00:47:09.133,00:00:05.089,,,,"would b we're getting rid off because this one the seventeen minus b",
00:47:09.173,00:47:11.747,00:00:02.574,,,,"that one could stay but the thirteen plus b",
00:47:11.747,00:47:13.131,00:00:01.384,,,,"I think we should get rid of that one",
00:47:13.651,00:47:15.568,00:00:01.917,,,"well you could it either way",,
00:47:15.568,00:47:17.035,00:00:01.467,,,"I think you could pause filler",,
00:47:17.473,00:47:20.880,00:00:03.407,,,"actually I don't think you could do it either way because",,
00:47:22.780,00:47:25.875,00:00:03.095,,,"we need to trans like I guess",,
00:47:26.104,00:47:27.420,00:00:01.316,,,,"I got it I got it on my mind",
00:47:27.720,00:47:29.140,00:00:01.420,,,"it's really hard to explain ",,
00:47:29.180,00:47:29.910,00:00:00.730,,,,"yeah I know right",
00:47:30.140,00:47:31.821,00:00:01.681,,,"if you want it",,
00:47:31.901,00:47:34.146,00:00:02.245,,,"I don't think you could keep the minus b",,
00:47:34.146,00:47:43.914,00:00:09.768,,,"because if you want it to minus that one if you want to do to minus b minus b you just be locked with like negative b",,
00:47:44.714,00:47:48.693,00:00:03.979,,,"I don't really know I just I don't think it works so",,
00:47:49.293,00:47:54.822,00:00:05.529,,,,"I guess I have to go two time two or we never mind",
00:47:55.422,00:47:57.084,00:00:01.662,,,,"we have to get rid of thirteen so",
00:47:57.453,00:47:59.309,00:00:01.856,,,"yeah you can do whatever first",,
00:47:59.309,00:48:01.593,00:00:02.284,,,,"thirteen minus thirteen equals zero",
00:48:02.112,00:48:04.395,00:00:02.283,,,,"seventeen minus thirteen equals four so",
00:48:05.045,00:48:06.622,00:00:01.577,,,"so let's get I don't know why",,
00:48:06.662,00:48:11.431,00:00:04.769,,,"I like to scribble this out but just so",,
00:48:11.431,00:48:12.628,00:00:01.197,,,"what did you say four",,
00:48:14.494,00:48:17.743,00:00:03.249,,,,"yeah four because three plus four equals thirteen",
00:48:19.110,00:48:21.000,00:00:01.890,,,"minus thirteen",,
00:48:23.544,00:48:25.477,00:00:01.933,,,"equals four",,
00:48:25.877,00:48:28.580,00:00:02.703,,,"I'm just going to rewrite this because yeah",,
00:48:33.680,00:48:34.372,00:00:00.692,,,"okay",,
00:48:37.072,00:48:39.957,00:00:02.885,,,"so here's what we have left",,
00:48:42.657,00:48:45.434,00:00:02.777,,,,"well so we must be going four divide it",
00:48:45.434,00:48:48.856,00:00:03.422,,,,"because two times b equals four",
00:48:48.856,00:48:50.522,00:00:01.666,,,,"so we go four divided by two",
00:48:50.522,00:48:52.159,00:00:01.637,,,,"it would be two",
00:48:52.847,00:48:55.134,00:00:02.287,,,"yeah so",,
00:48:54.973,00:48:56.131,00:00:01.158,,,,"so two equals b",
00:48:56.231,00:48:59.342,00:00:03.111,,,"yup b equals two",,
00:48:59.342,00:49:00.529,00:00:01.187,,,"that's not a two",,
00:49:01.129,00:49:02.067,00:00:00.938,,,,"that's an eight",
00:49:02.635,00:49:04.441,00:00:01.806,,,"that's now it's kind of a two",,
00:49:04.441,00:49:05.398,00:00:00.957,,,"I don't know",,
00:49:05.398,00:49:08.322,00:00:02.924,,,"I draw away in twos you know what whatever",,
00:49:08.322,00:49:11.624,00:00:03.302,,,"you can see it like above it that",,
00:49:11.624,00:49:12.412,00:00:00.788,,,"it's four",,
00:49:12.412,00:49:13.021,00:00:00.609,,,,"it's on recording (laughter)",
00:49:13.821,00:49:16.344,00:00:02.523,,,"yeah we're saying it",,
00:49:16.423,00:49:19.067,00:00:02.644,,,,"minus nine it (inaudible) so",
00:49:19.985,00:49:22.080,00:00:02.095,,,"this thing is easier I think",,
00:49:22.080,00:49:22.200,00:00:00.120,,,,"yeah",
00:49:23.238,00:49:24.166,00:00:00.928,,,"yeah this is easier",,
00:49:24.196,00:49:26.061,00:00:01.865,,,,"so one divided by nine",
00:49:24.661,00:49:26.073,00:00:01.412,,,"I think it's only one step",,
00:49:27.310,00:49:27.760,00:00:00.450,,,"mm-hmm",,
00:49:28.873,00:49:34.132,00:00:05.259,,,"so divided by but you would divide it by negative nine right",,
00:49:34.532,00:49:34.961,00:00:00.429,,,,"yeah but",
00:49:35.191,00:49:37.835,00:00:02.644,,,"yeah negative nine pause filler",,
00:49:37.974,00:49:39.311,00:00:01.337,,,,"well can you go negative nine that's all",
00:49:39.311,00:49:40.798,00:00:01.487,,,,"that is just add minus nine",
00:49:56.003,00:49:58.707,00:00:02.704,,,,"so nine times nine would equal eighty-one",
00:49:58.707,00:49:59.020,00:00:00.313,,,,"so",
00:50:01.320,00:50:05.332,00:00:04.012,,,,"so nine divided by nine or eighty-one divided by nine would be nine",
00:50:06.330,00:50:06.470,00:00:00.140,,,"okay",,
00:50:07.896,00:50:09.293,00:00:01.397,,,,"or minus nine (laughter) in this case",
00:50:09.523,00:50:14.292,00:00:04.769,,,"yeah right we would add the minus",,
00:50:14.531,00:50:17.305,00:00:02.774,,,"okay that was quick good job",,
00:50:19.933,00:50:21.186,00:00:01.253,,,"this one's longer",,
00:50:21.685,00:50:22.493,00:00:00.808,,,,"man",
00:50:22.493,00:50:27.961,00:00:05.468,,,"alright so now we do no all right the variable is still on one side",,
00:50:29.787,00:50:29.936,00:00:00.149,,,,"yeah",
00:50:30.705,00:50:30.944,00:00:00.239,,,"okay",,
00:50:31.822,00:50:32.736,00:00:00.914,,,,"so we get rid of the ten",
00:50:34.915,00:50:36.741,00:00:01.826,,,,"so ten minus ten equals zero",
00:50:36.741,00:50:39.365,00:00:02.624,,,,"eighty-two minus ten equals seventy-two",
00:50:40.602,00:50:41.140,00:00:00.538,,,"okay",,
00:50:42.640,00:50:52.914,00:00:10.274,,,"so we have seventy-two equals negative eight y",,
00:50:54.431,00:50:56.713,00:00:02.282,,,,"so now we'd be getting rid of the negative eight",
00:50:58.102,00:50:58.541,00:00:00.439,,,"pause filler yes",,
00:50:59.240,00:51:03.490,00:00:04.250,,,,"so negative eight equal or negative eight plus eight equals zero",
00:51:03.490,00:51:06.892,00:00:03.402,,,,"so seventy-two plus eight equals eighty",
00:51:14.350,00:51:16.720,00:00:02.370,,,"all right so y equals eighty",,
00:51:18.286,00:51:21.419,00:00:03.133,,,"okay you're much better at this than me",,
00:51:22.816,00:51:24.023,00:00:01.207,,,,"I just do it all in my mind",
00:51:24.871,00:51:25.211,00:00:00.340,,,"yeah",,
00:51:27.211,00:51:28.010,00:00:00.799,,,,"for some reason",
00:51:29.310,00:51:31.613,00:00:02.303,,,,"I'm good at doing it less than explaining at apparently",
00:51:32.030,00:51:32.510,00:00:00.480,,,"yeah",,
00:51:33.962,00:51:34.779,00:00:00.817,,,"I just didn't know",,
00:51:34.779,00:51:38.101,00:00:03.322,,,"like when you were tutoring me I didn't know if I just do the work",,
00:51:38.101,00:51:38.800,00:00:00.699,,,"or you just do the work",,
00:51:38.800,00:51:39.598,00:00:00.798,,,"it was confusing (laughter) okay",,
00:51:40.698,00:51:42.940,00:00:02.242,,,,"so we'd have to get rid of the sixty-five first here",
00:51:43.579,00:51:47.880,00:00:04.301,,,"okay and that's being subtracted which means (inaudible)",,
00:51:48.380,00:51:50.240,00:00:01.860,,,,"sixty-five minus sixty-five",
00:51:54.040,00:51:55.043,00:00:01.003,,,,"will equals zero",
00:51:55.043,00:51:58.298,00:00:03.255,,,,"than a hundred and seven minus sixty-five would equal",
00:52:05.673,00:52:07.499,00:00:01.826,,,,"pause filter sixty-two",
00:52:06.098,00:52:07.904,00:00:01.806,,,"wouldn't that be like thirty-five",,
00:52:08.190,00:52:08.690,00:00:00.500,,,"okay",,
00:52:09.398,00:52:11.146,00:00:01.748,,,,"I think its sixty-two let me check here",
00:52:11.546,00:52:20.166,00:00:08.620,,,"well I'm recently doing like take the seven off real quick you do pause filler one hundred minus sixty-five",,
00:52:20.166,00:52:20.894,00:00:00.728,,,"it's easy to do",,
00:52:26.894,00:52:28.357,00:00:01.463,,,,"that's not a five",
