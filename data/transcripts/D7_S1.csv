00:10:06.200,00:10:12.983,00:00:06.783,,,"so all right add six to each side",,
00:10:14.716,00:10:20.699,00:00:05.983,,,"and that's x equals",,
00:10:21.900,00:10:24.400,00:00:02.500,,,"and then three plus six nineteen",,

00:10:28.100,00:10:32.208,00:00:04.108,,,"so it's probably right I guess because x equals nineteen now",,
00:10:32.208,00:10:32.600,00:00:00.392,,,"so it's probably right I guess because x equals nineteen now","yeah I guess so",
00:10:32.600,00:10:33.741,00:00:01.141,,,,"yeah I guess so",
00:10:35.900,00:10:38.900,00:00:03.000,,,"yeah all right how do you go to the next one",,
00:10:39.591,00:10:40.600,00:00:01.009,,,"do you know",,

00:10:51.500,00:10:58.600,00:00:07.100,,,,"so pause filler I guess I do seven no eleven",
00:11:00.300,00:11:03.500,00:00:03.200,,,,"plus seventeen",
00:11:03.600,00:11:06.100,00:00:02.500,,,,"man my handwriting is horrible",

00:11:09.900,00:11:13.200,00:00:03.300,,,,"and I do eleven plus k",
00:11:13.700,00:11:16.800,00:00:03.100,,,,"so that cancels out k so",
00:11:16.900,00:11:18.500,00:00:01.600,,,"like add eleven each side",,
00:11:19.000,00:11:23.900,00:00:04.900,,,,"yeah so then it's pretty much that's twenty-eight",
00:11:24.900,00:11:26.400,00:00:01.500,,,"yeah and then plus",,
00:11:28.000,00:11:30.800,00:00:02.800,,,"wait yeah or subtract",,
00:11:30.800,00:11:34.700,00:00:03.900,,,"are you subtracting eleven because that would cancel out eleven then",,
00:11:36.600,00:11:41.500,00:00:04.900,,,"if you subtract it eleven because then like then that would be zero",,
00:11:41.500,00:11:43.100,00:00:01.600,,,"and you can just like go like that",,
00:11:43.700,00:11:47.500,00:00:03.800,,,"and then that would be seven wait no that would be six",,
00:11:47.500,00:11:50.400,00:00:02.900,,,"(laughter) you got it",,
00:11:50.500,00:11:50.800,00:00:00.300,,,,"yeah",

00:11:57.691,00:12:01.716,00:00:04.025,,,"okay let's start like let's start fresh I guess",,
00:12:01.716,00:12:04.600,00:00:02.884,,,"like here okay",,
00:12:04.800,00:12:06.900,00:00:02.100,,,,"okay so",
00:12:08.800,00:12:11.100,00:00:02.300,,,"let's subtract the eleven from each side",,
00:12:12.100,00:12:18.200,00:00:06.100,,,,"okay so seventeen minus eleven",
00:12:18.200,00:12:22.900,00:00:04.700,,,,"and k minus eleven",
00:12:22.900,00:12:24.400,00:00:01.500,,,,"if I did equals eleven",
00:12:25.399,00:12:25.408,00:00:00.009,,,"I just like scratch out the one",,
00:12:25.408,00:12:26.191,00:00:00.783,,,"I just like scratch out the one","I have no idea",

00:12:30.800,00:12:34.200,00:00:03.400,,,"or did you like or you do eleven minus eleven",,
00:12:34.200,00:12:35.400,00:00:01.200,,,"and seventeen minus eleven",,
00:12:37.216,00:12:38.983,00:00:01.767,,,"and they like (inaudible) I don't know",,
00:12:39.116,00:12:46.291,00:00:07.175,,,,"yeah pause filler well k isn't going anywhere because it's not a number necessarily so",
00:12:47.200,00:12:48.800,00:00:01.600,,,"so then we can just cancel out the eleven then",,
00:12:48.800,00:12:50.200,00:00:01.400,,,"and would just be a k alone",,
00:12:50.500,00:12:53.800,00:00:03.300,,,,"yeah it's hardly like what I'm doing",
00:12:54.200,00:12:56.266,00:00:02.066,,,"then it could be yeah",,

00:13:01.600,00:13:06.600,00:00:05.000,,,,"okay so then seventeen minus eleven would be six",
00:13:06.600,00:13:08.500,00:00:01.900,,,"six yeah",,
00:13:10.000,00:13:12.800,00:00:02.800,,,"so then six equals k oh",,
00:13:13.300,00:13:14.200,00:00:00.900,,,,"k equals six",
00:13:14.900,00:13:15.200,00:00:00.300,,,"yeah",,

00:18:33.800,00:18:37.300,00:00:03.500,,,"and then if it does I can know if it's divisible by five",,
00:18:38.300,00:18:39.400,00:00:01.100,,,"wait it might work",,
00:18:39.400,00:18:39.900,00:00:00.500,,,"one minute",,
00:18:40.800,00:18:46.600,00:00:05.800,,,"two time four is twenty yeah x is five",,
00:18:47.600,00:18:48.000,00:00:00.400,,,"is it",,
00:18:48.300,00:18:50.400,00:00:02.100,,,"I don't know one minute",,
00:18:50.400,00:18:56.600,00:00:06.200,,,"let me okay because let's do forty-four yeah because forty-four times five is two hundred twenty",,
00:18:56.900,00:18:59.100,00:00:02.200,,,"so x equals five",,
00:19:00.000,00:19:01.000,00:00:01.000,,,,"congratulations",
00:19:01.000,00:19:02.600,00:00:01.600,,,,"I have no idea if that's right",

00:19:48.400,00:19:50.300,00:00:01.900,,,"because I think like it switches off halfway through",,
00:19:50.300,00:19:52.600,00:00:02.300,,,"I think you tutor me for like half the time",,
00:19:52.600,00:19:53.500,00:00:00.900,,,"and then like it switches",,
00:19:53.500,00:19:55.600,00:00:02.100,,,"I don't know because like",,
00:19:55.600,00:19:56.000,00:00:00.400,,"(inaudible)","I don't know (laughter) because like if that's because you have the paper right",,
00:19:56.000,00:20:00.000,00:00:04.000,,,"I don't know (laughter) because like if that's because you have the paper right",,
00:20:00.400,00:20:00.900,00:00:00.500,,,,"yeah",
00:20:01.200,00:20:02.300,00:00:01.100,,,"like the cheat sheet thing",,

00:20:09.768,00:20:15.100,00:00:05.332,,,,"okay so first you are going to take the nine",
00:20:16.000,00:20:23.800,00:00:07.800,,,,"and what you want to do is actually you want to add it to thirteen p",
00:20:24.200,00:20:25.800,00:00:01.600,,,"you want to add the nine to thirteen p",,
00:20:26.400,00:20:26.800,00:00:00.400,,,,"yeah",
00:20:28.400,00:20:29.200,00:00:00.800,,,"wait what do you mean",,
00:20:29.200,00:20:32.400,00:00:03.200,,,"like so or you want to add like add nine",,
00:20:32.900,00:20:35.400,00:00:02.500,,,"like do you want to cancel out the nine and",,
00:20:35.400,00:20:41.100,00:00:05.700,,,,"no what you want to do is you want to add nine plus negative nine which wait no",
00:20:41.100,00:20:42.600,00:00:01.500,,,"yeah yeah because (inaudible) yeah",,
00:20:42.600,00:20:44.700,00:00:02.100,,,"and then you could like cross that",,
00:20:44.700,00:20:46.200,00:00:01.500,,,,"yeah which would equal nine so",
00:20:46.200,00:20:48.500,00:00:02.300,,,"well wait negative nine plus nine",,
00:20:48.700,00:20:49.300,00:00:00.600,,,,"yeah",
00:20:49.500,00:20:50.000,00:00:00.500,,,"so it's zero",,
00:20:52.200,00:20:53.000,00:00:00.800,,,,"wait might be",
00:20:53.000,00:20:58.900,00:00:05.900,,,,"well anyway you want to make that nine to a positive",
00:20:59.100,00:21:01.600,00:00:02.500,,,,"so I don't know how to do that",
00:21:01.600,00:21:02.000,00:00:00.400,,,,"I forget",
00:21:02.000,00:21:05.600,00:00:03.600,,,"or a zero or a positive like okay",,
00:21:06.840,00:21:10.200,00:00:03.360,,,"I can hear my voice like going all along it's like",,
00:21:12.300,00:21:15.300,00:00:03.000,,,"I can hear like it goes that",,
00:21:15.300,00:21:18.000,00:00:02.700,,,"what are you drawing",,
00:21:18.000,00:21:19.400,00:00:01.400,,,"you're like hello",,
00:21:19.400,00:21:21.300,00:00:01.900,,,,"I have no idea",
00:21:21.300,00:21:24.100,00:00:02.800,,,,"okay let's go back to the point",
00:21:24.100,00:21:28.800,00:00:04.700,,,,"so what you want to do is you want to pause filler make that nine a positive",
00:21:29.500,00:21:30.700,00:00:01.200,,,"a positive so",,
00:21:31.100,00:21:34.400,00:00:03.300,,,,"yes so positive nine negative",
00:21:34.600,00:21:37.400,00:00:02.800,,,"so add eighteen and then",,
00:21:37.400,00:21:45.700,00:00:08.300,,,,"I'm going to replace this because this makes no sense (sfx) (laughter)",
00:21:45.700,00:21:50.700,00:00:05.000,,,"you just erased the problem (laughter)",,
00:21:50.700,00:21:51.200,00:00:00.500,,,,"ops",
00:21:51.300,00:21:52.200,00:00:00.900,,,"there you go",,
00:21:52.200,00:21:52.500,00:00:00.300,,,"oh no",,
00:21:52.500,00:21:55.100,00:00:02.600,,,"that's because I wrote on it",,
00:21:55.100,00:21:56.200,00:00:01.100,,,"and you probably yeah",,
00:21:56.200,00:21:56.700,00:00:00.500,,,"oh gosh",,
00:21:58.500,00:21:59.400,00:00:00.900,,,"just like undo it",,
00:22:01.200,00:22:03.000,00:00:01.800,,,"there we are okay",,
00:22:03.100,00:22:03.900,00:00:00.800,,,,"ah",
00:22:04.100,00:22:09.900,00:00:05.800,,,"so are we trying to so how do you get the negative nine to a nine a positive",,
00:22:10.500,00:22:13.600,00:00:03.100,,,"so you add eighteen wait because that would get you there",,
00:22:13.600,00:22:16.145,00:00:02.545,,,,"no you have to keep the nine",
00:22:16.652,00:22:20.913,00:00:04.261,,,,"so just do nine plus thirteen",
00:22:21.300,00:22:21.700,00:00:00.400,,,"negative nine",,
00:22:22.100,00:22:23.400,00:00:01.300,,,,"no positive nine",
00:22:23.700,00:22:25.200,00:00:01.500,,,"but this is a negative nine",,
00:22:25.200,00:22:25.600,00:00:00.400,,,"what do you mean",,
00:22:25.600,00:22:29.600,00:00:04.000,,,,"yeah just I think don't you add it",
00:22:29.800,00:22:33.600,00:00:03.800,,,"I think you add nine because then that will cancel out like positive and",,
00:22:33.600,00:22:34.100,00:00:00.500,,,,"yeah add it",
00:22:34.100,00:22:36.100,00:00:02.000,,,"so then that would be zero and so then",,
00:22:37.500,00:22:38.500,00:00:01.000,,,,"no really",
00:22:38.500,00:22:38.811,00:00:00.311,,,"yeah because if you add negative nine and then a positive nine like they cancel out","no really",
00:22:38.811,00:22:44.300,00:00:05.489,,,"yeah because if you add negative nine and then a positive nine like they cancel out",,
00:22:44.300,00:22:46.800,00:00:02.500,,,"and just equal zero I think",,
00:22:47.700,00:22:50.000,00:00:02.300,,,,"maybe well I know so",
00:22:50.000,00:22:52.000,00:00:02.000,,,"(inaudible) and then you add listen",,
00:22:52.000,00:22:54.900,00:00:02.900,,,"and then if you do one thing to one side you have to do it to the other",,
00:22:54.900,00:22:56.700,00:00:01.800,,,"so you have to add nine to the side I think",,
00:22:59.500,00:23:03.000,00:00:03.500,,,,"yeah you have to add nine to both sides",
00:23:03.000,00:23:03.500,00:00:00.500,,,"yeah",,
00:23:03.800,00:23:10.900,00:00:07.100,,,,"and then you get the pause filler variable and the number together",
00:23:11.100,00:23:13.100,00:00:02.000,,,,"and then it has one number on the other side",
00:23:13.900,00:23:16.900,00:00:03.000,,,"so this is fifty and then this is",,
00:23:17.029,00:23:17.130,00:00:00.101,,,,"good",
00:23:17.507,00:23:18.600,00:00:01.093,,,,"oh my gosh",
00:23:18.600,00:23:19.800,00:00:01.200,,,,"okay I get it",
00:23:19.800,00:23:20.500,00:00:00.700,,,,"I get it",
00:23:20.500,00:23:25.200,00:00:04.700,,,,"okay so what you want to do is so you cancel out that nine",
00:23:25.200,00:23:29.200,00:00:04.000,,,,"and then you add that nine where you got it",
00:23:29.200,00:23:30.400,00:00:01.200,,,"so then forty-nine right",,
00:23:31.121,00:23:34.300,00:00:03.179,,,,"no you add it to thirteen and forty-one",
00:23:34.800,00:23:38.333,00:00:03.533,,,"wait so you add the nine to the thirteen and then negative nine and forty-one",,
00:23:38.800,00:23:39.200,00:00:00.400,,,,"yeah",
00:23:39.900,00:23:40.600,00:00:00.700,,,"okay",,
00:23:41.400,00:23:43.800,00:00:02.400,,,,"so you want to add it to both sides",
00:23:45.300,00:23:49.300,00:00:04.000,,,"but like but thirteen p is on the same side as negative nine",,
00:23:50.000,00:23:50.900,00:00:00.900,,,,"well that's separate",
00:23:50.900,00:23:52.200,00:00:01.300,,,,"that's like separate somehow",
00:23:54.707,00:23:57.565,00:00:02.858,,,,"okay but like the paper says that it's separate",
00:23:57.565,00:23:59.600,00:00:02.035,,,,"I don't know how",
00:23:59.600,00:24:00.900,00:00:01.300,,,,"confusing okay",
00:24:05.505,00:24:07.400,00:00:01.895,,,"all right what does the paper say",,
00:24:08.300,00:24:09.800,00:00:01.500,,,"so the I don't know",,
00:24:09.800,00:24:10.282,00:00:00.482,,,"so the I don't know","it's not the exact answer to that so",
00:24:10.282,00:24:12.000,00:00:01.718,,,,"it's not the exact answer to that so",
00:24:12.000,00:24:12.800,00:00:00.800,,,"well yeah",,
00:24:13.200,00:24:15.100,00:00:01.900,,,,"it's a different equation",
00:24:15.700,00:24:19.800,00:00:04.100,,,,"so what I'm doing is I'm just switching up the numbers and variable",
00:24:20.400,00:24:29.300,00:00:08.900,,,,"okay so what it says to do here is so you got thirteen p equals fifty",
00:24:30.200,00:24:33.600,00:00:03.400,,,,"so that is probably correct",
00:24:34.000,00:24:34.800,00:00:00.800,,,,"I have no idea",
00:24:34.800,00:24:38.600,00:00:03.800,,,"yeah but do we have to do we have to simplify it down to one p",,
00:24:39.800,00:24:42.200,00:00:02.400,,,,"no not yet",
00:24:42.200,00:24:45.400,00:00:03.200,,,,"okay so then you want to divide",
00:24:45.600,00:24:45.800,00:00:00.200,,,"oh",,
00:24:45.800,00:24:50.000,00:00:04.200,,,,"thirteen divided b thirteen divide and then",
00:24:50.000,00:24:52.400,00:00:02.400,,,"and then fifty divided by thirteen",,
00:24:52.400,00:24:52.600,00:00:00.200,,,,"no",
00:24:53.400,00:24:56.500,00:00:03.100,,,,"you want to divide well yeah technically",
00:24:57.797,00:24:58.222,00:00:00.425,,,"okay",,
00:24:58.939,00:25:03.600,00:00:04.661,,,,"and that equals pause filler the p equals whatever",
00:25:03.800,00:25:12.500,00:00:08.700,,,"fifteen divided by thirteen is right so because if you do or now we do thirteen p divided thirteen which is p",,
00:25:13.500,00:25:14.200,00:00:00.700,,,"I think yeah",,
00:25:14.600,00:25:17.000,00:00:02.400,,,"and then fifty divided by thirteen",,
00:25:17.000,00:25:19.403,00:00:02.403,,,"so we can probably just write that as a fraction right",,
00:25:19.888,00:25:20.929,00:00:01.041,,,,"no you can't",
00:25:21.403,00:25:21.505,00:00:00.102,,,"no",,
00:25:22.242,00:25:22.343,00:00:00.101,,,,"no",
00:25:22.848,00:25:24.626,00:00:01.778,,,"oh gosh okay (laughter)",,
00:25:24.626,00:25:25.545,00:00:00.919,,,"oh gosh okay (laughter)","you have to divide",
00:25:25.545,00:25:26.030,00:00:00.485,,,,"you have to divide",
00:25:26.232,00:25:34.979,00:00:08.747,,,"oh yeah okay so thirteen and then fifty",,

00:36:09.700,00:36:15.100,00:00:05.400,,,"so then yeah and so then that would be twenty-three plus y",,
00:36:15.100,00:36:18.400,00:00:03.300,,,,"wait well then that would be eighteen yeah wait",
00:36:18.400,00:36:24.200,00:00:05.800,,,"yeah because it would cancel out because the negative y and the positive y just makes zero oh",,
00:36:26.800,00:36:27.800,00:00:01.000,,,,"now wait",
00:36:40.400,00:36:44.700,00:00:04.300,,,,"it's really awkward that we're like in the building with all these college students",
00:36:44.700,00:36:47.800,00:00:03.100,,,,"it's like we're only in like seventh grade",
00:36:48.100,00:36:50.000,00:00:01.900,,,,"and we're only like twenty year olds",
00:36:50.000,00:36:51.900,00:00:01.900,,,,"it's like hi",
00:36:51.900,00:36:57.303,00:00:05.403,,,,"and I don't know you this is really scary okay",
00:36:57.949,00:37:04.848,00:00:06.899,,,"all right so if you added y to both sides the ys",,
00:37:05.721,00:37:08.000,00:00:02.279,,,,"I think it's adding eighteen",
00:37:10.000,00:37:20.700,00:00:10.700,,,"well because if you added y to both sides then you would because you can have the negative y I don't think",,
00:37:23.848,00:37:27.000,00:00:03.152,,,"like because then if you add y to both sides",,
00:37:27.000,00:37:34.500,00:00:07.500,,,"then pause filler then this the y on this side will become just zero",,
00:37:34.500,00:37:37.900,00:00:03.400,,,"sort of like have with the nine it's like you have negative nine plus nine equals zero",,
00:37:37.900,00:37:48.671,00:00:10.771,,,"and then this will just become twenty-three plus y equals eighteen oh (laughter) plus y equals eighteen",,
00:37:48.700,00:37:53.200,00:00:04.500,,,"and then like and then you could probably subtract twenty-three from each side",,
00:37:55.200,00:37:55.600,00:00:00.400,,,,"yeah",
00:37:55.600,00:37:58.300,00:00:02.700,,,"you see here you want to try it",,
00:37:59.100,00:38:00.468,00:00:01.368,,,"and I'll like yeah",,
00:38:41.784,00:38:43.200,00:00:01.416,,,"so what's in the box",,
00:38:49.595,00:38:52.500,00:00:02.905,,,"(laughter) all right",,
00:38:56.200,00:38:57.600,00:00:01.400,,,"back to the problem (laughter)",,
00:38:59.468,00:39:00.300,00:00:00.832,,,"oh my gosh",,
00:39:00.400,00:39:01.700,00:00:01.300,,,"it's on my leg pause filler",,
00:39:05.500,00:39:06.000,00:00:00.500,,,"so",,
00:39:08.500,00:39:09.100,00:00:00.600,,,"if we're",,
00:39:10.900,00:39:12.300,00:00:01.400,,,"just trying to go through it",,
00:39:12.300,00:39:15.200,00:00:02.900,,,"so if we add y to the side",,
00:39:15.200,00:39:18.900,00:00:03.700,,,"and we add y to the other side as well",,
00:39:18.900,00:39:20.500,00:00:01.600,,,"what do we have",,
00:39:22.300,00:39:22.400,00:00:00.100,,,"oh",,
00:39:36.253,00:39:38.000,00:00:01.747,,,,"I'm still chewing",
00:39:38.000,00:39:41.300,00:00:03.300,,,,"okay so I don't think we add y",
00:39:42.200,00:39:45.900,00:00:03.700,,,,"I think we only add y once",
00:39:46.500,00:39:48.900,00:00:02.400,,,,"and then it's eighteen plus twenty-three",
00:39:52.300,00:39:53.100,00:00:00.800,,,"but yeah",,
00:39:53.400,00:39:54.100,00:00:00.700,,,"wait what do you mean",,
00:39:56.400,00:39:59.400,00:00:03.000,,,,"I'm like explaining the problem now (laughter)",
00:40:00.700,00:40:08.100,00:00:07.400,,,,"okay so negative y plus eighteen equals twenty",
00:40:08.100,00:40:08.519,00:00:00.419,,,"negative","okay so negative y plus eighteen equals twenty",
00:40:08.519,00:40:08.600,00:00:00.081,,,"negative",,
00:40:10.300,00:40:11.063,00:00:00.763,,,"what do you mean",,
00:40:11.100,00:40:13.200,00:00:02.100,,,"how did you get that because I don't",,
00:40:13.200,00:40:14.400,00:00:01.200,,,,"it's the problem up here",
00:40:15.683,00:40:16.300,00:00:00.617,,,"oh yeah",,
00:40:16.300,00:40:19.405,00:00:03.105,,,"(laughter) I was like where did that come from",,
00:40:21.139,00:40:28.569,00:00:07.430,,,,"okay so we would subtract y from eighteen negative y",
00:40:31.000,00:40:39.300,00:00:08.300,,,,"and then we would equal twenty-three plus eighteen",
00:40:42.800,00:40:46.600,00:00:03.800,,,"but on here they have like the same form",,
00:40:46.600,00:40:53.000,00:00:06.400,,,"and they add like y first like",,
00:40:53.000,00:40:56.600,00:00:03.600,,,"around here we're pause filler it's like the same thing with different numbers",,
00:40:57.500,00:41:00.700,00:00:03.200,,,"they just added like the number they've added like the x first",,
00:41:02.700,00:41:03.600,00:00:00.900,,,"and then they add",,
00:41:03.600,00:41:08.800,00:00:05.200,,,"and then they subtracted the number so",,
00:41:10.700,00:41:12.911,00:00:02.211,,,,"so then it would be eighteen y",
00:41:15.341,00:41:18.405,00:00:03.064,,,"what do you mean (laughter)",,
00:41:19.400,00:41:21.800,00:00:02.400,,,,"y plus eighteen equals eighteen y",
00:41:22.300,00:41:23.000,00:00:00.700,,,"negative y",,
00:41:23.100,00:41:24.000,00:00:00.900,,,"remember it's negative",,
00:41:27.100,00:41:28.700,00:00:01.600,,,,"then negative eighteen y",
00:41:29.200,00:41:29.700,00:00:00.500,,,"yeah",,
00:41:31.721,00:41:38.500,00:00:06.779,,,"all right negative yeah eighteen negative y what because like no y has to be positive",,
00:41:43.038,00:41:43.329,00:00:00.291,,,"doesn't it",,
00:41:45.152,00:41:46.114,00:00:00.962,,,,"I don't know",
00:41:46.300,00:41:48.500,00:00:02.200,,,"that's like start this thing fresh again",,
00:41:49.800,00:41:52.341,00:00:02.541,,,"because it's like a mess (laughter)",,
00:42:10.300,00:42:14.700,00:00:04.400,,,"okay so let's try like what I see on the paper",,
00:42:14.700,00:42:23.400,00:00:08.700,,,"so let's try plus y on the side plus y on this side",,
00:42:23.800,00:42:26.600,00:00:02.800,,,,"don't you want to make the ink a little smaller",
00:42:27.500,00:42:28.500,00:00:01.000,,,"yeah I can try that",,
00:42:30.600,00:42:31.100,00:00:00.500,,,"here we go",,
00:42:31.100,00:42:33.000,00:00:01.900,,,"oh that's really strong",,
00:42:33.000,00:42:35.200,00:00:02.200,,,"okay there we go",,
00:42:35.200,00:42:38.974,00:00:03.774,,,"so now so if we add y on both sides what do we have",,
00:42:41.291,00:42:48.900,00:00:07.609,,,,"pause filler so well this is zero",
00:42:48.900,00:42:49.101,00:00:00.201,,,"yeah that would cancel out","pause filler so well this is zero",
00:42:49.101,00:42:51.100,00:00:01.999,,,"yeah that would cancel out",,
00:42:51.600,00:42:54.100,00:00:02.500,,,,"and this is eighteen y",
00:42:54.400,00:42:55.544,00:00:01.144,,,"so no",,
00:42:57.303,00:42:57.500,00:00:00.197,,,"you won't need the",,
00:42:57.500,00:42:58.200,00:00:00.700,,,"you won't need the","how",
00:42:58.200,00:42:58.595,00:00:00.395,,,"you won't need the",,
00:42:58.595,00:43:03.000,00:00:04.405,,,"you wouldn't need the eighteen because you would add by each side",,
00:43:03.000,00:43:06.000,00:00:03.000,,,"so you would add y to each side of the equation",,
00:43:06.000,00:43:06.800,00:00:00.800,,,"so you would add y to",,
00:43:06.800,00:43:07.400,00:00:00.600,,,,"oh twenty-three",
00:43:07.400,00:43:09.000,00:00:01.600,,,,"it's twenty-three y",
00:43:09.500,00:43:10.700,00:00:01.200,,,"twenty-three plus y yeah",,
00:43:12.500,00:43:19.600,00:00:07.100,,,"so now it's going to be eighteen because it equals twenty-three plus y",,
00:43:23.500,00:43:24.100,00:00:00.600,,,"and then",,
00:43:27.200,00:43:31.278,00:00:04.078,,,"and then what do we do pause filler it's",,
00:43:31.400,00:43:32.700,00:00:01.300,,,,"that was weird",
00:43:33.400,00:43:34.000,00:00:00.600,,,"what",,
00:43:34.000,00:43:38.300,00:00:04.300,,,,"someone was staring at me it was really scary",
00:43:38.300,00:43:48.481,00:00:10.181,,,"okay (laughter) so now we have that",,
00:43:51.177,00:43:53.000,00:00:01.823,,,"we can cancel out the twenty-three",,
00:43:53.000,00:43:57.500,00:00:04.500,,,"and then so we have y alone by subtracting twenty-three from each side",,
00:43:57.500,00:44:00.100,00:00:02.600,,,"so do that and then yeah",,
00:44:00.300,00:44:03.200,00:00:02.900,,,"so what's eighteen minus twenty-three",,
00:44:05.190,00:44:05.405,00:00:00.215,,,,"eight",
00:44:07.329,00:44:09.152,00:00:01.823,,,"here let's just like write it out",,
00:44:20.100,00:44:21.500,00:00:01.400,,,"yeah eighteen minus twenty",,
00:44:21.500,00:44:22.700,00:00:01.200,,,"it's going to be negative",,
00:44:24.400,00:44:26.600,00:00:02.200,,,,"I hate negative numbers",
00:44:26.900,00:44:29.177,00:00:02.277,,,,"they're so confusing",
00:44:45.265,00:44:47.200,00:00:01.935,,,,"huh I did a circle",
00:44:47.500,00:44:47.900,00:00:00.400,,,"okay",,
00:44:48.100,00:44:49.100,00:00:01.000,,,,"sort of (laughter)",
00:44:50.645,00:44:56.900,00:00:06.255,,,"so then it would be negative fifteen equals y right",,
00:44:57.600,00:44:58.000,00:00:00.400,,,,"yeah",
00:44:58.600,00:45:05.700,00:00:07.100,,,"because if we did eighteen minus twenty-three because we canceled out the twenty-three by subtracting twenty-three from it so then it's just",,
00:45:05.800,00:45:07.200,00:00:01.400,,,,"oh I figured it out",
00:45:07.400,00:45:12.500,00:00:05.100,,,"yeah and then it's just negative fifteen equals y right",,
00:45:14.800,00:45:16.300,00:00:01.500,,,,"when you press it the button",
00:45:16.300,00:45:17.700,00:00:01.400,,,,"it draws it",
00:45:19.700,00:45:20.300,00:00:00.600,,,"what do you mean",,
00:45:20.500,00:45:25.500,00:00:05.000,,,,"press field not the small part of it but the larger",
00:45:26.700,00:45:30.400,00:00:03.700,,,,"no the button the bigger yeah",
00:45:30.400,00:45:33.700,00:00:03.300,,,,"and then start drawing without touching it",
00:45:33.700,00:45:33.900,00:00:00.200,,,"wait",,
00:45:35.400,00:45:35.900,00:00:00.500,,,"wait",,
00:45:42.303,00:45:42.900,00:00:00.597,,,"I see that",,
00:45:42.900,00:45:44.126,00:00:01.226,,,"it like makes really little lines though",,
00:45:48.063,00:45:48.354,00:00:00.291,,,"oh",,
00:45:50.600,00:45:51.100,00:00:00.500,,,,"yeah",
00:45:51.300,00:45:52.000,00:00:00.700,,,"that's cool",,
00:45:56.000,00:46:00.500,00:00:04.500,,,,"I just tapped it",
00:46:00.500,00:46:04.400,00:00:03.900,,,,"that's really weird",
00:46:05.300,00:46:10.100,00:00:04.800,,,,"okay your face just got really big",
00:46:10.200,00:46:11.900,00:00:01.700,,,"really (laughter)",,
00:46:11.900,00:46:12.100,00:00:00.200,,,,"yeah",
00:46:12.200,00:46:17.000,00:00:04.800,,,"ops okay pause filler I just pressed actually pressing it",,
00:46:17.000,00:46:19.100,00:00:02.100,,,"okay how do we go to the next thing",,
00:46:20.500,00:46:23.200,00:00:02.700,,,,"don't you see the arrows that I've got on the page",
00:46:23.700,00:46:25.900,00:00:02.200,,,"oh I did it okay",,
00:46:26.800,00:46:27.100,00:00:00.300,,,"now",,
00:46:32.700,00:46:34.800,00:00:02.100,,,"we got to do this",,
00:46:36.700,00:46:37.600,00:00:00.900,,,,"yes",
00:46:37.800,00:46:43.200,00:00:05.400,,,"start by (laughter) adding k",,
00:46:44.455,00:46:48.860,00:00:04.405,,,"try adding k to each side of the equation",,
00:46:48.900,00:46:51.600,00:00:02.700,,,,"that's pretty much getting rid of the ks",
00:46:51.600,00:46:54.200,00:00:02.600,,,"well if you add k to this side",,
00:46:55.000,00:46:56.400,00:00:01.400,,,"and you add k to this side",,
00:46:57.700,00:46:59.300,00:00:01.600,,,"this will be canceled out",,
00:46:59.300,00:47:00.000,00:00:00.700,,,"and just be zero",,
00:47:00.000,00:47:05.600,00:00:05.600,,,"so it will be negative fourteen equals thirty-six",,
00:47:05.600,00:47:09.400,00:00:03.800,,,"and then since we add another k to the k it would be plus two k",,
00:47:09.400,00:47:11.300,00:00:01.900,,,"do you get that",,
00:47:14.600,00:47:17.900,00:00:03.300,,,,"what am I doing",
00:47:17.900,00:47:20.300,00:00:02.400,,,,"this is really scary",
00:47:21.100,00:47:23.700,00:00:02.600,,,"what did you do",,
00:47:23.700,00:47:27.100,00:00:03.400,,,,"I just made you big big",

00:48:38.379,00:48:39.303,00:00:00.924,,,"he said this was supposed to be black",,
00:48:39.303,00:48:42.800,00:00:03.497,,,"I think yeah because mine is supposed to be green because I'm like the tutor",,
00:48:42.800,00:48:44.500,00:00:01.700,,,"and yours is supposed to be black",,
00:48:45.900,00:48:47.800,00:00:01.900,,,,"black is so boring",
00:48:50.215,00:48:51.329,00:00:01.114,,,,"it's like black",
00:48:53.898,00:48:56.962,00:00:03.064,,,,"like this pen it's not colorful",
00:48:57.000,00:48:59.126,00:00:02.126,,,,"it's just (sfx)",

00:49:09.329,00:49:15.278,00:00:05.949,,,"all right so when we added k to each side",,
00:49:16.038,00:49:17.354,00:00:01.316,,,,"this is how it look like",
00:49:20.190,00:49:21.050,00:00:00.860,,,"a comma",,
00:49:22.848,00:49:25.000,00:00:02.152,,,,"I think it's too big to be a comma",
00:49:27.417,00:49:29.101,00:00:01.684,,,,"probably it came",
00:49:30.100,00:49:35.100,00:00:05.000,,,"yeah all right back on topic",,
00:49:35.600,00:49:37.400,00:00:01.800,,,"if we add k",,
00:49:40.200,00:49:53.900,00:00:13.700,,,"(laughter) if we added k to each side the left side of the equation would be fourteen negative fourteen because the other side cancels out because the ks cancel out",,
00:49:54.700,00:49:56.700,00:00:02.000,,,"and in the other side would be thirty-six",,
00:49:56.900,00:50:00.000,00:00:03.100,,,"and then plus two k now that we added another k",,
00:50:00.500,00:50:02.700,00:00:02.200,,,"I don't know what that is",,
00:50:03.700,00:50:08.822,00:00:05.122,,,"wait I don't know what that is but yeah",,
00:50:18.000,00:50:19.797,00:00:01.797,,,,"only chair",
00:50:24.038,00:50:27.759,00:00:03.721,,,"all right so I hear my voice echoing",,
00:50:29.200,00:50:31.500,00:00:02.300,,,,"I hear it too",
00:50:32.100,00:50:40.531,00:00:08.431,,,"all right so now that we have the equation simplify down to a negative fourteen equals thirty-six plus two k",,
00:50:43.500,00:50:45.600,00:00:02.100,,,"one minute",,
00:50:45.800,00:50:47.582,00:00:01.782,,,"one minute",,
00:50:56.700,00:50:57.800,00:00:01.100,,,"this is confusing",,
00:51:00.600,00:51:02.481,00:00:01.881,,,"okay now what we want to do",,
00:51:04.683,00:51:05.050,00:00:00.367,,,"is",,
00:51:15.481,00:51:17.354,00:00:01.873,,,,"(inaudible) yourself",

00:51:22.700,00:51:25.300,00:00:02.600,,,,"because you were just never mind",
00:51:26.900,00:51:28.200,00:00:01.300,,,"okay well",,
00:51:32.100,00:51:33.000,00:00:00.900,,,"okay well",,
00:51:35.190,00:51:35.200,00:00:00.010,,,,"whoops",

00:51:35.683,00:51:41.633,00:00:05.950,,,"oh no okay I know what to do",,
00:51:43.038,00:51:46.500,00:00:03.462,,,"now what we got to do is",,
00:51:48.500,00:51:52.200,00:00:03.700,,,"subtract thirty-six from each side",,
00:51:54.300,00:52:00.300,00:00:06.000,,,"so then we have so we subtract thirty-six from each side of the equation",,
00:52:00.700,00:52:04.500,00:00:03.800,,,"we'll just have two k right here",,
00:52:05.600,00:52:14.400,00:00:08.800,,,"and then figure out what negative fourteen minus thirty-one is or thirty-six because then that would be the answer pretty much",,
00:52:14.600,00:52:17.500,00:00:02.900,,,"and (inaudible) too but yeah",,
00:52:17.500,00:52:20.600,00:00:03.100,,,,"why are you dropping your Skittles",
