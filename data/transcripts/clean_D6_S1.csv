184,6,1,00:13:04.250,00:13:12.673,00:00:08.423,that would be fifteen times four is sixty,
185,6,1,00:13:11.261,00:13:12.100,00:00:00.839,,sixty
186,6,1,00:13:12.890,00:13:13.419,00:00:00.529,right,

193,6,1,00:13:28.655,00:13:33.534,00:00:04.879,so you would start this by subtraction,
194,6,1,00:13:33.693,00:13:39.184,00:00:05.491,right they're actually twenty problems,

204,6,1,00:14:14.341,00:14:17.983,00:00:03.642,and then you would subtract eight k right,
205,6,1,00:14:18.122,00:14:25.376,00:00:07.254,,yup and you have negative fifty-eight and there

210,6,1,00:14:38.865,00:14:40.002,00:00:01.137,,and then that would be
211,6,1,00:14:40.501,00:14:41.629,00:00:01.128,eight and two sevenths,
212,6,1,00:14:42.547,00:14:43.215,00:00:00.668,,oh yeah okay

283,6,1,00:18:31.007,00:18:31.716,00:00:00.709,,we're special
284,6,1,00:18:33.163,00:18:36.246,00:00:03.083,okay so would you subtract the u or four u,
285,6,1,00:18:36.246,00:18:37.233,00:00:00.987,or do you subtract,
286,6,1,00:18:37.233,00:18:39.049,00:00:01.816,or do you add forty-two or subtract eight,
287,6,1,00:18:39.169,00:18:41.024,00:00:01.855,,I'm subtracting the eight
288,6,1,00:18:41.272,00:18:42.426,00:00:01.154,good (inaudible),
289,6,1,00:18:42.426,00:18:45.914,00:00:03.488,yeah sometimes I'm like no,
290,6,1,00:18:45.914,00:18:47.500,00:00:01.586,I don�t want to subtract the eight,
291,6,1,00:18:47.500,00:18:50.044,00:00:02.544,but today I am let's see,
292,6,1,00:18:50.503,00:18:51.391,00:00:00.888,so let's see,
293,6,1,00:18:51.391,00:19:03.514,00:00:12.123,negative of fifty plus u equals four u minus u minus u negative fifty,
294,6,1,00:19:04.382,00:19:10.005,00:00:05.623,wait I have to make sure you got it first,
295,6,1,00:19:10.005,00:19:10.947,00:00:00.942,three,
296,6,1,00:19:11.875,00:19:18.180,00:00:06.305,what what are you why are you why do you hate me just computers such a mean human,
297,6,1,00:19:18.490,00:19:21.852,00:00:03.362,,wait no undo go back
298,6,1,00:19:23.788,00:19:29.544,00:00:05.756,seventeen this will be negative sixteen and then one thirty,
299,6,1,00:19:31.194,00:19:32.010,00:00:00.816,wait hold,
300,6,1,00:19:31.211,00:19:35.301,00:00:04.090,,will be two thirds because sixteen times three is forty-eight yeah okay
301,6,1,00:19:33.194,00:19:39.751,00:00:06.557,yup yup there that is the answer,
302,6,1,00:19:40.210,00:19:42.578,00:00:02.368,,yeah okay
303,6,1,00:19:45.231,00:19:53.640,00:00:08.409,,pause filler okay so this is forty-nine and
304,6,1,00:19:55.426,00:19:57.790,00:00:02.364,wait where do you get forty-nine n from,
305,6,1,00:19:58.848,00:20:02.739,00:00:03.891,,oh wow I (laughter) that was wrong
306,6,1,00:20:03.218,00:20:12.367,00:00:09.149,yeah so I would do n minus ninety-nine,
307,6,1,00:20:12.836,00:20:13.395,00:00:00.559,,equals
308,6,1,00:20:13.395,00:20:19.072,00:00:05.677,wait hold on equals one hundred n minus n,
309,6,1,00:20:20.020,00:20:24.011,00:00:03.991,,okay and then seven wait yeah
310,6,1,00:20:24.649,00:20:32.900,00:00:08.251,so then you get negative ninety-nine equals ninety-nine and (inaudible) nine over ninety-nine wow,
311,6,1,00:20:32.900,00:20:39.368,00:00:06.468,so many big numbers and yet you just get negative one what a waste of math,
312,6,1,00:20:41.061,00:20:43.955,00:00:02.894,pause filler so how would you start this,
313,6,1,00:20:44.514,00:20:49.114,00:00:04.600,,pause filler I subtracted the seven because why not
314,6,1,00:20:49.852,00:20:50.341,00:00:00.489,forty,
315,6,1,00:20:52.160,00:20:53.893,00:00:01.733,,you subtract the g
316,6,1,00:20:52.521,00:20:53.010,00:00:00.489,forty,
317,6,1,00:20:54.811,00:20:58.073,00:00:03.262,,and then you have g equals four
318,6,1,00:21:01.240,00:21:01.800,00:00:00.560,,boom
319,6,1,00:21:02.907,00:21:04.721,00:00:01.814,wait hold on I want to make sure that's right,
320,6,1,00:21:10.631,00:21:17.719,00:00:07.088,yup wait isn't eighteen minus seven wait oh never mind,
321,6,1,00:21:17.719,00:21:18.557,00:00:00.838,you did differently than me,
322,6,1,00:21:18.557,00:21:21.729,00:00:03.172,you know what I screwed up I can't math,
323,6,1,00:21:22.178,00:21:24.400,00:00:02.222,I'm terrible at math like wow,
324,6,1,00:21:25.680,00:21:28.584,00:00:02.904,,pause filler okay so this is
325,6,1,00:21:28.584,00:21:31.318,00:00:02.734,,you subtract the ten m
326,6,1,00:21:31.837,00:21:40.058,00:00:08.221,,so you have wait what negative nine equals
327,6,1,00:21:41.425,00:21:43.979,00:00:02.554,and then you can add the nine right,
328,6,1,00:21:45.555,00:21:47.880,00:00:02.325,,well you have the twenty-seven to the other side right
329,6,1,00:21:48.349,00:21:50.260,00:00:01.911,oh yup you're right,
330,6,1,00:21:51.921,00:21:54.166,00:00:02.245,,what's negative nine plus twenty-seven
331,6,1,00:21:54.924,00:21:55.593,00:00:00.669,eighteen,
332,6,1,00:21:56.411,00:21:58.256,00:00:01.845,,oh thanks
333,6,1,00:22:00.199,00:22:02.287,00:00:02.088,and then divide out by negative nine,
334,6,1,00:22:02.287,00:22:04.901,00:00:02.614,so then what did you get m equals what,
335,6,1,00:22:05.400,00:22:07.416,00:00:02.016,,negative two
336,6,1,00:22:07.416,00:22:08.663,00:00:01.247,that's what I got,
337,6,1,00:22:08.753,00:22:10.359,00:00:01.606,so it's probably right,
338,6,1,00:22:11.327,00:22:13.380,00:00:02.053,okay go to the next one I guess,
339,6,1,00:22:14.140,00:22:14.722,00:00:00.582,,yup
340,6,1,00:22:16.545,00:22:22.132,00:00:05.587,,pause filler minus subtract the pause filler eight y
341,6,1,00:22:22.132,00:22:25.644,00:00:03.512,,so you have negative seven y equals
342,6,1,00:22:25.644,00:22:26.692,00:00:01.048,,add the eleven
343,6,1,00:22:27.061,00:22:27.779,00:00:00.718,thirty-five,
344,6,1,00:22:27.779,00:22:28.498,00:00:00.719,,thirty-five
345,6,1,00:22:29.126,00:22:33.870,00:00:04.744,and then you get y equals negative five,
346,6,1,00:22:30.032,00:22:33.870,00:00:03.838,,y equals negative five
347,6,1,00:22:35.530,00:22:38.994,00:00:03.464,oh what was really really not that hard okay,
348,6,1,00:22:39.533,00:22:42.900,00:00:03.367,so I would personally subtract the nineteen first,
349,6,1,00:22:44.544,00:22:46.276,00:00:01.732,,oh wait
350,6,1,00:22:46.470,00:22:49.860,00:00:03.390,because I don't less negatives,
351,6,1,00:22:52.071,00:22:55.990,00:00:03.919,,fifty-three minus twenty-eight is five
352,6,1,00:23:02.620,00:23:04.571,00:00:01.951,oh it's going to be a fraction again,
353,6,1,00:23:09.828,00:23:10.682,00:00:00.854,this one you get ,
354,6,1,00:23:13.540,00:23:19.103,00:00:05.563,pause filler negative ten do you get negative ten point two,
355,6,1,00:23:20.031,00:23:21.228,00:00:01.197,,one second pause filler
356,6,1,00:23:23.682,00:23:24.999,00:00:01.317,it's a it's a fraction,
357,6,1,00:23:24.999,00:23:26.127,00:00:01.128,but I made it that small,
358,6,1,00:23:26.127,00:23:27.703,00:00:01.576,because I feel like being fancy,
359,6,1,00:23:30.387,00:23:33.560,00:00:03.173,because one fifth is zero point two,
360,6,1,00:23:34.009,00:23:36.643,00:00:02.634,I think I'm finally figuring out how to write with this thing,
361,6,1,00:23:37.591,00:23:42.021,00:00:04.430,,yes same okay I got negative two
362,6,1,00:23:42.021,00:23:43.727,00:00:01.706,,add one twenty fifths
363,6,1,00:23:44.715,00:23:46.890,00:00:02.175,what wait how did you get that,
364,6,1,00:23:46.939,00:23:49.983,00:00:03.044,,pause filler wait thirty
365,6,1,00:23:50.332,00:23:57.535,00:00:07.203,twenty you forgot the other side existed thing wait,
366,6,1,00:23:57.535,00:23:58.623,00:00:01.088,show all the work for it,
367,6,1,00:23:58.623,00:23:59.750,00:00:01.127,hold on clear it,
368,6,1,00:24:00.439,00:24:02.963,00:00:02.524,,it's all up here in green up here
369,6,1,00:24:02.963,00:24:06.216,00:00:03.253,hold on but can you like show each step out,
370,6,1,00:24:06.216,00:24:08.111,00:00:01.895,so I can see what you did,
371,6,1,00:24:08.111,00:24:10.775,00:00:02.664,because you should get that from what I understand,
372,6,1,00:24:10.775,00:24:12.611,00:00:01.836,can you clear it,
373,6,1,00:24:12.841,00:24:15.894,00:00:03.053,how do I why can't I not clear it,
374,6,1,00:24:20.862,00:24:21.521,00:00:00.659,oh clear,
375,6,1,00:24:25.032,00:24:26.629,00:00:01.597,,I'm trying to like erase it all
376,6,1,00:24:26.629,00:24:29.154,00:00:02.525,but where's the erasing button,
377,6,1,00:24:29.712,00:24:31.269,00:00:01.557,,it's on the side it's like
378,6,1,00:24:31.269,00:24:34.581,00:00:03.312,oh thank you oh my god thank you I didn't even know it existed,
379,6,1,00:24:36.537,00:24:37.944,00:00:01.407,I'm erasing at all,
380,6,1,00:24:39.650,00:24:48.230,00:00:08.580,okay got it I wish you can make the eraser a little,
381,6,1,00:24:47.732,00:24:48.440,00:00:00.708,,bigger yeah
382,6,1,00:24:49.038,00:24:52.435,00:00:03.397,i feel like I'm scratching the touchscreen every time I write on it,
383,6,1,00:24:55.723,00:24:57.459,00:00:01.736,,okay starting over
384,6,1,00:24:59.534,00:24:59.704,00:00:00.170,okay,
385,6,1,00:25:02.119,00:25:06.908,00:00:04.789,,so I started by subtracting the twenty-eight d from the fifty-three
386,6,1,00:25:06.908,00:25:21.205,00:00:14.297,,so fifty-three minus twenty-eight equals twenty-five right
387,6,1,00:25:21.205,00:25:25.835,00:00:04.630,,and then you have twenty-five d
388,6,1,00:25:26.663,00:25:26.822,00:00:00.159,right,
389,6,1,00:25:26.872,00:25:28.229,00:00:01.357,,and then you do
390,6,1,00:25:28.409,00:25:30.893,00:00:02.484,,you subtract the seventy from that side
391,6,1,00:25:31.700,00:25:32.189,00:00:00.489,right,
392,6,1,00:25:31.940,00:25:42.337,00:00:10.397,,and then you do seventy minus nineteen equals pause filler fifty-one
393,6,1,00:25:43.016,00:25:45.929,00:00:02.913,,so that's negative fifty-one
394,6,1,00:25:46.428,00:25:48.862,00:00:02.434,the time on my computer is really off,
395,6,1,00:25:49.960,00:25:51.157,00:00:01.197,,what does it say
396,6,1,00:25:51.157,00:25:53.562,00:00:02.405,six zero five and then it's five thirty-two,
397,6,1,00:25:54.154,00:25:55.000,00:00:00.846,,that's what mine says
398,6,1,00:25:56.250,00:26:04.750,00:00:08.500,,and then d equals negative fifty-one twenty-five
399,6,1,00:26:06.053,00:26:11.112,00:00:05.059,,or that equals negative two one
400,6,1,00:26:12.469,00:26:13.417,00:00:00.948,,that�s what I got
401,6,1,00:26:13.456,00:26:14.654,00:00:01.198,,I mean I think it's right
402,6,1,00:26:16.071,00:26:19.752,00:00:03.681,oh wait yeah well yeah I think you're right,
403,6,1,00:26:20.520,00:26:20.962,00:00:00.442,,okay
404,6,1,00:26:29.650,00:26:31.166,00:00:01.516,I'm not even going to write,
405,6,1,00:26:31.296,00:26:32.550,00:00:01.254,I just look (inaudible),
406,6,1,00:27:18.469,00:27:22.230,00:00:03.761,we get the same answer yeah that�s,
407,6,1,00:27:22.490,00:27:25.144,00:00:02.654,you're allowed to leave it as an improper fraction,
408,6,1,00:27:25.632,00:27:26.002,00:00:00.370,,oh okay
409,6,1,00:27:26.840,00:27:29.234,00:00:02.394,my math teacher always tells that,
410,6,1,00:27:30.791,00:27:33.295,00:00:02.504,,okay so we subtract the y
411,6,1,00:27:33.295,00:27:38.773,00:00:05.478,,twelve y equals is that a negative oh my gosh
412,6,1,00:27:39.671,00:27:53.179,00:00:13.508,negative ninety right no negative hundred negative hundred right twenty-seven (inaudible),
413,6,1,00:27:53.182,00:27:53.729,00:00:00.547,,yeah it's a hundred
414,6,1,00:27:59.205,00:28:01.973,00:00:02.768,I put slashes through my zeros so (inaudible) I'm weird,
415,6,1,00:28:05.590,00:28:07.498,00:00:01.908,,yeah that boom
416,6,1,00:28:08.043,00:28:10.291,00:00:02.248,all right next problem,
417,6,1,00:28:12.446,00:28:17.714,00:00:05.268,,pause filler okay so subtract that twenty
418,6,1,00:28:19.879,00:28:21.505,00:00:01.626,,wait there's a person
419,6,1,00:28:28.200,00:28:28.559,00:00:00.359,hello,

428,6,1,00:29:16.713,00:29:18.237,00:00:01.524,,yeah I don�t like Skittles either
429,6,1,00:29:18.587,00:29:24.562,00:00:05.975,(inaudible) I ate lunch at ike eleven forty-five,

437,6,1,00:30:11.916,00:30:21.090,00:00:09.174,(inaudible) they look like M&Ms (inaudible) a little,
438,6,1,00:30:21.467,00:30:23.303,00:00:01.836,,yeah M&M�s are better in my opinion
439,6,1,00:30:23.339,00:30:24.645,00:00:01.306,I agree with that,
440,6,1,00:30:29.583,00:30:31.211,00:00:01.628,next you're going to teach me math,
441,6,1,00:30:32.238,00:30:39.282,00:00:07.044,it means I get to do problems for how many minutes like twenty-ish minutes,
442,6,1,00:30:32.482,00:30:33.010,00:00:00.528,,wooo
443,6,1,00:30:41.044,00:30:42.545,00:00:01.501,,we get forty dollars for this right
444,6,1,00:30:43.411,00:30:43.644,00:00:00.233,mm-hmm,
445,6,1,00:30:44.523,00:30:45.052,00:00:00.529,,okay
446,6,1,00:30:45.595,00:30:46.795,00:00:01.200,I owe my mom ten,
447,6,1,00:30:46.795,00:30:48.661,00:00:01.866,because I bought something on vacation,
448,6,1,00:30:48.661,00:30:50.916,00:00:02.255,and I didn't have no money to pay through it,
449,6,1,00:30:51.036,00:30:51.973,00:00:00.937,so I owe her money,
450,6,1,00:30:53.300,00:30:58.120,00:00:04.820,and I'm like add money to buy a bunch of crap today so exciting,
451,6,1,00:31:02.928,00:31:14.223,00:00:11.295,wait like the real question is is this actually worth it,
452,6,1,00:31:15.552,00:31:18.393,00:00:02.841,,yeah I mean the math is pretty easy so it's like
453,6,1,00:31:18.423,00:31:22.933,00:00:04.510,I mean I guess I was going towards a study that will help people do algebra in the future,
454,6,1,00:31:23.193,00:31:25.038,00:00:01.845,it's like beneficial,
455,6,1,00:31:25.657,00:31:28.401,00:00:02.744,because like you know how I got stuck on a problem,
456,6,1,00:31:28.401,00:31:30.366,00:00:01.965,and your friends are like I don't know,
457,6,1,00:31:30.456,00:31:31.693,00:00:01.237,so then let them be hopeful,
458,6,1,00:31:31.693,00:31:34.168,00:00:02.475,I'd be hopeful to have this type of thing I presume,
459,6,1,00:31:34.168,00:31:34.337,00:00:00.169,,yeah
460,6,1,00:31:38.388,00:31:42.349,00:00:03.961,but then shouldn't it be people who have already taken algebra tutoring people who are taking algebra,
461,6,1,00:31:43.856,00:31:46.320,00:00:02.464,,do we have is this the only thing we have to do because
462,6,1,00:31:46.320,00:31:49.114,00:00:02.794,,or is there another session like after this
463,6,1,00:31:49.114,00:31:50.590,00:00:01.476,I think this is the only one,
464,6,1,00:31:50.590,00:31:53.819,00:00:03.229,and if there's another one we�d better be paid forty dollars for it,
465,6,1,00:32:01.875,00:32:03.631,00:00:01.756,blue ones aren't that gross,
466,6,1,00:32:17.435,00:32:19.275,00:00:01.840,I don�t feel like doing algebra,
467,6,1,00:32:20.113,00:32:24.423,00:00:04.310,but for the packet that they gave us at the beginning I felt like I was doing my math homework,
468,6,1,00:32:25.132,00:32:27.895,00:00:02.763,,pause filler are you an algebra right now like algebra one
469,6,1,00:32:27.895,00:32:28.574,00:00:00.679,yeah are you,
470,6,1,00:32:28.983,00:32:29.153,00:00:00.170,,yeah
471,6,1,00:32:30.500,00:32:35.758,00:00:05.258,oh so like and I have a really nice teacher and all,
472,6,1,00:32:36.067,00:32:38.950,00:00:02.883,but it's kind of like tedious,
473,6,1,00:32:40.048,00:32:42.802,00:00:02.754,I don't know like kind of pointless,
474,6,1,00:32:43.916,00:32:46.084,00:00:02.168,,yeah we did this at the beginning of the year
475,6,1,00:32:46.154,00:32:47.401,00:00:01.247,,now we're doing other stuff
476,6,1,00:32:47.652,00:32:48.181,00:00:00.529,yeah,
477,6,1,00:32:48.109,00:32:50.285,00:00:02.176,,but you said you didn't like Shadyside or something
478,6,1,00:32:50.285,00:32:50.953,00:00:00.668,uh-uh uh-uh,
479,6,1,00:32:51.093,00:32:51.781,00:00:00.688,,why not
480,6,1,00:32:53.597,00:32:57.059,00:00:03.462,for what you pay the teacher should be better a little,
481,6,1,00:32:57.059,00:33:00.142,00:00:03.083,they have the worst science teacher in the universe,
482,6,1,00:33:00.402,00:33:02.337,00:00:01.935,and they like they care so much about sports,
483,6,1,00:33:02.337,00:33:04.103,00:00:01.766,and at the high school you're not allowed to leave early,
484,6,1,00:33:04.103,00:33:07.725,00:00:03.622,and you have to go after and make up the hours you missed and so like,
485,6,1,00:33:08.663,00:33:09.780,00:00:01.117,,oh that sucks
486,6,1,00:33:09.780,00:33:11.417,00:00:01.637,so I'm going to Winchester,
487,6,1,00:33:12.484,00:33:13.711,00:00:01.227,because they are crazy,
488,6,1,00:33:13.711,00:33:16.744,00:00:03.033,and so that�s exciting,
489,6,1,00:33:28.378,00:33:33.816,00:00:05.438,like I don't know (inaudible) kind of have a crappy teacher,
490,6,1,00:33:34.524,00:33:36.320,00:00:01.796,like did he take my stylus again,
491,6,1,00:33:36.729,00:33:36.978,00:00:00.249,,yeah
492,6,1,00:33:36.978,00:33:38.595,00:00:01.617,I'm offended,
493,6,1,00:33:39.962,00:33:40.880,00:00:00.918,,and when I asked her why
494,6,1,00:33:40.880,00:33:46.088,00:00:05.208,,she said she didn't want us to get too excited and like start doing things
495,6,1,00:33:47.275,00:33:49.919,00:00:02.644,oh and my thumbs are real bad,
496,6,1,00:33:55.736,00:33:58.539,00:00:02.803,I wonder how many people actually signed up for this study,
497,6,1,00:34:02.358,00:34:04.446,00:00:02.088,,I kind of wish we got paid more but
498,6,1,00:34:04.446,00:34:07.519,00:00:03.073,I mean we are even paid way above minimum wage,
499,6,1,00:34:07.519,00:34:09.125,00:00:01.606,we're also getting paid to do math,
500,6,1,00:34:09.125,00:34:12.168,00:00:03.043,and math is annoying so we should get paid a lot of money,
501,6,1,00:34:13.785,00:34:16.199,00:00:02.414,apparently in some country they pay you to go to school,
502,6,1,00:34:16.199,00:34:18.145,00:00:01.946,,that would be so nice
503,6,1,00:34:18.145,00:34:19.741,00:00:01.596,that would be like amazing,
504,6,1,00:34:21.527,00:34:23.423,00:00:01.896,it's like they record all of this,
505,6,1,00:34:23.423,00:34:27.593,00:00:04.170,that�s creeping me out a little,
506,6,1,00:34:27.903,00:34:31.744,00:00:03.841,they record everything we're saying and doing,
507,6,1,00:34:32.073,00:34:36.544,00:00:04.471,and that�s creepy but you know,
508,6,1,00:34:46.820,00:34:47.069,00:00:00.249,,okay
509,6,1,00:34:49.300,00:34:49.915,00:00:00.615,all right,
510,6,1,00:34:57.585,00:34:59.594,00:00:02.009,so does it actually work this time,
511,6,1,00:34:59.615,00:35:01.106,00:00:01.491,will I be able to write normally,
512,6,1,00:35:04.610,00:35:05.880,00:00:01.270,it was going (inaudible),
513,6,1,00:35:10.348,00:35:11.583,00:00:01.235,like I don't know how to erase it,
514,6,1,00:35:11.893,00:35:13.339,00:00:01.446,because we're going,
515,6,1,00:35:18.737,00:35:19.545,00:00:00.808,,wait I don�t have the
516,6,1,00:35:20.134,00:35:20.743,00:00:00.609,oh sorry,
517,6,1,00:35:27.946,00:35:29.553,00:00:01.607,oh yeah yeah yeah,
518,6,1,00:35:44.139,00:35:45.227,00:00:01.088,oh like full screen,
519,6,1,00:35:47.402,00:35:53.089,00:00:05.687,okay,
520,6,1,00:35:53.089,00:35:55.244,00:00:02.155,,okay so what do you do first
521,6,1,00:35:56.312,00:35:58.188,00:00:01.876,let's see let's see,
522,6,1,00:35:58.567,00:36:02.059,00:00:03.492,why are you not letting me write through there,
523,6,1,00:36:02.178,00:36:03.236,00:00:01.058,did I do it right,
524,6,1,00:36:04.034,00:36:04.503,00:00:00.469,,yup
525,6,1,00:36:05.122,00:36:10.100,00:00:04.978,okay next problem these aren't the problems you did right just not sure we're not saying or anything,
526,6,1,00:36:11.000,00:36:13.812,00:00:02.812,yeah pause filler,
527,6,1,00:36:13.812,00:36:18.062,00:00:04.250,and then you have to divide out by a negative one,
528,6,1,00:36:18.062,00:36:19.349,00:00:01.287,because there's a negative,
529,6,1,00:36:21.715,00:36:22.692,00:00:00.977,and then you get y,
530,6,1,00:36:22.871,00:36:30.474,00:00:07.603,there's a negative five okay next one,
531,6,1,00:36:25.300,00:36:27.125,00:00:01.825,,wooo yeah
532,6,1,00:36:30.474,00:36:36.810,00:00:06.336,pause filler I'm going to change the color so we're like not the same color,
533,6,1,00:36:36.235,00:36:36.655,00:00:00.420,,yeah
534,6,1,00:36:36.910,00:36:38.436,00:00:01.526,but I don�t like that color,
535,6,1,00:36:39.883,00:36:41.020,00:00:01.137,go with brown,
536,6,1,00:36:41.020,00:36:43.145,00:00:02.125,you know what let's go brown,
537,6,1,00:36:44.033,00:36:46.598,00:00:02.565,okay I know I wasn�t supposed to change the color,
538,6,1,00:36:46.598,00:36:49.002,00:00:02.404,but you know what I'm a rebel in this study,
539,6,1,00:36:49.002,00:36:49.690,00:00:00.688,,you're such a rebel
540,6,1,00:36:50.199,00:36:54.090,00:00:03.891,such a rebel let's so then you have to add fourteen,
541,6,1,00:36:54.090,00:37:00.905,00:00:06.815,so you get negative k equals fifty plus k wait oh my,
542,6,1,00:37:00.985,00:37:02.302,00:00:01.317,and then you subtract k,
543,6,1,00:37:02.302,00:37:03.719,00:00:01.417,and then you subtract k again,
544,6,1,00:37:04.038,00:37:06.901,00:00:02.863,so you get negative two k equals fifty,
545,6,1,00:37:06.901,00:37:09.037,00:00:02.136,and then you just divide out by a negative two,
546,6,1,00:37:09.037,00:37:09.276,00:00:00.239,,two yeah
547,6,1,00:37:09.276,00:37:14.823,00:00:05.547,and then k is negative twenty-five whoa like math,
548,6,1,00:37:15.180,00:37:15.382,00:00:00.202,,whoo
549,6,1,00:37:16.198,00:37:18.425,00:00:02.227,I have twenty two problems to do outside,
550,6,1,00:37:18.425,00:37:20.221,00:00:01.796,and I'm going to add b,
551,6,1,00:37:21.119,00:37:21.339,00:00:00.220,,okay
552,6,1,00:37:22.346,00:37:24.362,00:00:02.016,so you get seventeen,
553,6,1,00:37:26.607,00:37:29.520,00:00:02.913,seventeen equals thirteen plus two b,
554,6,1,00:37:29.520,00:37:34.638,00:00:05.118,I'm showing on equal sign here equals,
555,6,1,00:37:34.688,00:37:37.671,00:00:02.983,what the what the why why why do you do this to me,
556,6,1,00:37:37.671,00:37:40.724,00:00:03.053,and then four equals two b,
557,6,1,00:37:40.724,00:37:41.742,00:00:01.018,divide by out two,
558,6,1,00:37:41.962,00:37:43.269,00:00:01.307,and divide out by two,
559,6,1,00:37:43.269,00:37:44.955,00:00:01.686,and then two is b,
560,6,1,00:37:46.152,00:37:46.232,00:00:00.080,,yeah
561,6,1,00:37:46.491,00:37:48.028,00:00:01.537,all right,
562,6,1,00:37:48.267,00:37:51.670,00:00:03.403,,wait pause filler never mind yeah go
563,6,1,00:37:51.670,00:37:53.994,00:00:02.324,and screen up right okay,
564,6,1,00:37:56.599,00:37:57.895,00:00:01.296,I hope this isn't that hard,
565,6,1,00:37:57.895,00:38:01.098,00:00:03.203,okay so then you just divide out by negative nine,
566,6,1,00:38:02.395,00:38:02.535,00:00:00.140,,yeah
567,6,1,00:38:03.014,00:38:07.344,00:00:04.330,so g equals negative nine,
568,6,1,00:38:07.344,00:38:10.327,00:00:02.983,whoo my life is so easy right now,
569,6,1,00:38:11.125,00:38:12.742,00:00:01.617,wait how do I get to the next page,
570,6,1,00:38:12.742,00:38:13.729,00:00:00.987,okay there we go,
571,6,1,00:38:14.019,00:38:15.336,00:00:01.317,so I'll subtract ten,
572,6,1,00:38:15.336,00:38:16.304,00:00:00.968,,ten yeah
573,6,1,00:38:21.761,00:38:26.900,00:00:05.139,seventy-two equals negative eight y divided by negative eight,
574,6,1,00:38:26.900,00:38:28.396,00:00:01.496,for some reason I always write those slashes,
575,6,1,00:38:28.396,00:38:29.633,00:00:01.237,I really don�t know why,
576,6,1,00:38:29.963,00:38:34.841,00:00:04.878,it's like a weird habit so yeah why can't I write an equal sign,
577,6,1,00:38:34.911,00:38:35.829,00:00:00.918,this thing hates me,
578,6,1,00:38:36.228,00:38:41.237,00:00:05.009,all right next y equals,
579,6,1,00:38:41.237,00:38:44.988,00:00:03.751,scribble me too minus sixty-five,
580,6,1,00:38:44.988,00:38:53.677,00:00:08.689,this better come out to be easy in division pause filler let me forty-two hey,
581,6,1,00:38:55.155,00:39:01.561,00:00:06.406,equals negative fourteen x divided that by negative fourteen divided up by negative fourteen,
582,6,1,00:39:01.561,00:39:08.405,00:00:06.844,and then you get negative three equals y,
583,6,1,00:39:08.405,00:39:10.061,00:00:01.656,,yeah okay here
584,6,1,00:39:11.159,00:39:13.065,00:00:01.906,oh this is hard-ish,
585,6,1,00:39:13.274,00:39:14.671,00:00:01.397,what are you doing,
586,6,1,00:39:14.671,00:39:16.427,00:00:01.756,this thing hates me so much,
587,6,1,00:39:16.856,00:39:18.522,00:00:01.666,you just so work so much better than I,
588,6,1,00:39:19.041,00:39:23.581,00:00:04.540,seventy-five equals negative nine k,
589,6,1,00:39:23.581,00:39:27.312,00:00:03.731,divide that by negative nine,
590,6,1,00:39:27.502,00:39:33.378,00:00:05.876,so then you get four and one third equals k or four point three repeating,
591,6,1,00:39:34.376,00:39:40.161,00:00:05.785,,yeah okay pause filler what do you do first
592,6,1,00:39:40.642,00:39:42.558,00:00:01.916,I'm just going to add p to get rid of that one,
593,6,1,00:39:42.558,00:39:43.735,00:00:01.177,because it's annoying me,
594,6,1,00:39:44.144,00:39:49.522,00:00:05.378,so you get negative fifty-two equals nine p minus sixteen,
595,6,1,00:39:49.522,00:39:51.088,00:00:01.566,then you have to add,
596,6,1,00:39:51.108,00:39:52.345,00:00:01.237,my god what is it doing,
597,6,1,00:39:52.425,00:40:02.233,00:00:09.808,plus sixteen plus sixteen so that would be forty-eight,
598,6,1,00:40:02.592,00:40:07.411,00:00:04.819,negative forty-eight no negative thirty-eight nope that�s wrong,
599,6,1,00:40:07.611,00:40:12.210,00:00:04.599,hold on thirty-eight,
600,6,1,00:40:12.210,00:40:13.208,00:00:00.998,jesus I can't do math,
601,6,1,00:40:13.417,00:40:17.957,00:00:04.540,thirty-eight equals nine p divided by nine divided by,
602,6,1,00:40:18.027,00:40:20.751,00:00:02.724,,wait wouldn't it be negative forty-six
603,6,1,00:40:20.900,00:40:22.327,00:00:01.427,,look what I wrote here
604,6,1,00:40:24.544,00:40:28.992,00:00:04.448,no it's negative fifty-two plus,
605,6,1,00:40:31.107,00:40:33.412,00:00:02.305,so negative would be four,
606,6,1,00:40:33.412,00:40:34.909,00:00:01.497,,oh no it's thirty-six
607,6,1,00:40:34.909,00:40:35.717,00:00:00.808,,it's thirty-six
608,6,1,00:40:35.717,00:40:39.099,00:00:03.382,thirty-six so when you get four equals p,
609,6,1,00:40:41.154,00:40:42.390,00:00:01.236,yeah math,
610,6,1,00:40:41.420,00:40:41.622,00:00:00.202,,yeah
611,6,1,00:40:44.930,00:40:47.580,00:00:02.650,uh this looks challenging,
612,6,1,00:40:52.110,00:40:53.037,00:00:00.927,plus one forty one,
613,6,1,00:40:53.037,00:41:07.105,00:00:14.068,so you get negative fourteen w equals one hundred and sixty plus twenty-six w minus twenty-six w minus twenty-six w which is forty,
614,6,1,00:41:08.389,00:41:17.013,00:00:08.624,w equals one hundred and sixty divided by negative forty divided by negative forty,
615,6,1,00:41:17.871,00:41:20.965,00:00:03.094,which would be w equals negative four,
616,6,1,00:41:21.088,00:41:24.767,00:00:03.679,so math whatever (inaudible) math,
617,6,1,00:41:29.250,00:41:32.929,00:00:03.679,stop come and get us,
618,6,1,00:41:33.236,00:41:34.982,00:00:01.746,,do we should we do we have to
619,6,1,00:41:35.700,00:41:36.529,00:00:00.829,I don't know,
620,6,1,00:41:37.514,00:41:38.758,00:00:01.244,,no
621,6,1,00:41:39.700,00:41:42.673,00:00:02.973,(laughter) refusing,
622,6,1,00:41:45.524,00:41:48.871,00:00:03.347,,okay well what had happened last time
623,6,1,00:41:49.260,00:41:50.846,00:00:01.586,,they just didn't do anything
624,6,1,00:41:50.846,00:41:52.003,00:00:01.157,,so I guess we can go on
625,6,1,00:41:52.003,00:41:53.530,00:00:01.527,wait should we wait though,
626,6,1,00:41:53.530,00:41:55.236,00:00:01.706,because last time they told us to wait,
627,6,1,00:41:58.842,00:41:59.101,00:00:00.259,,pause filler
628,6,1,00:42:01.091,00:42:02.724,00:00:01.633,I guess we're like special,
629,6,1,00:42:02.724,00:42:04.485,00:00:01.761,and we apparently do these really quickly,
630,6,1,00:42:05.533,00:42:05.942,00:00:00.409,,yeah I guess
631,6,1,00:42:06.949,00:42:09.364,00:00:02.415,well I guess if you're doing this at the beginning of the year it would be harder,
632,6,1,00:42:10.262,00:42:15.450,00:00:05.188,,yeah should we pause filler
633,6,1,00:42:17.038,00:42:18.000,00:00:00.962,where are they,
634,6,1,00:42:19.212,00:42:28.990,00:00:09.778,we don�t know where they are (laughter) where are you,
635,6,1,00:42:34.599,00:42:37.819,00:00:03.220,,okay pause filler why don�t we just see if they're
636,6,1,00:42:40.244,00:42:49.129,00:00:08.885,I'll look up into the (inaudible) (sfx),
637,6,1,00:43:05.954,00:43:08.707,00:00:02.753,,I don�t like see anyone so
638,6,1,00:43:08.636,00:43:13.869,00:00:05.233,I'm going to check hold on I'm going to check outside my door to see anyone there,
639,6,1,00:44:22.733,00:44:25.630,00:00:02.897,okay oh,
640,6,1,00:44:26.901,00:44:32.748,00:00:05.847,okay so add y to both sides like you're saying,
641,6,1,00:44:32.748,00:44:32.948,00:00:00.200,,yeah
642,6,1,00:44:34.305,00:44:38.400,00:00:04.095,so if you subtracted y then there would be zero ys and that would be kind of problematic,
643,6,1,00:44:48.283,00:44:48.901,00:00:00.618,,oh oh sorry
644,6,1,00:44:50.827,00:45:04.097,00:00:13.270,so when you get negative one hundred and six equals two y divided by two divided by two negative fifty-three okay is that right probably,
645,6,1,00:45:04.386,00:45:04.576,00:00:00.190,,yeah
646,6,1,00:45:05.421,00:45:07.459,00:00:02.038,I was writing that upside down that whole time,
647,6,1,00:45:08.645,00:45:11.640,00:00:02.995,it's so much easier oh my god wow,
648,6,1,00:45:21.588,00:45:24.610,00:00:03.022,equals four divided by forty-eight plus two p,
649,6,1,00:45:29.549,00:45:32.552,00:00:03.003,okay it's minus fifteen,
650,6,1,00:45:34.418,00:45:37.842,00:00:03.424,negative two hundred and thirty,
651,6,1,00:45:39.840,00:45:53.098,00:00:13.258,equals two p divided by two divided by two negative one hundred fifteen equals p,
652,6,1,00:45:53.098,00:45:54.602,00:00:01.504,but why didn't I (inaudible) thirteen,
653,6,1,00:45:55.630,00:46:03.023,00:00:07.393,this was one k plus g,
654,6,1,00:46:03.961,00:46:06.335,00:00:02.374,oh this one is going to be semi easier right,
655,6,1,00:46:07.014,00:46:14.437,00:00:07.423,,yeah so it's two g and then
656,6,1,00:46:16.123,00:46:19.675,00:00:03.552,minus fifty-three minus fifty-three this will be,
657,6,1,00:46:19.675,00:46:25.657,00:00:05.982,hold on one seventy no seventy-six,
658,6,1,00:46:25.657,00:46:26.713,00:00:01.056,I can't talk okay,
659,6,1,00:46:26.713,00:46:35.053,00:00:08.340,seventy-six equals two g divided by two divided by two thirty-eight equals g,
660,6,1,00:46:37.093,00:46:37.392,00:00:00.299,,yeah
661,6,1,00:46:39.693,00:46:39.992,00:00:00.299,,okay
662,6,1,00:46:41.804,00:46:46.534,00:00:04.730,thank you pause filler and plus m,
663,6,1,00:46:49.787,00:46:52.041,00:00:02.254,these are all like the same type of problem,
664,6,1,00:46:53.505,00:46:53.799,00:00:00.294,,yeah
665,6,1,00:46:53.890,00:46:59.904,00:00:06.014,I wish my math homework was all the same type of problem specifically like eight thousand different types of math problems a day,
666,6,1,00:47:02.004,00:47:02.250,00:00:00.246,it's thirty,
667,6,1,00:47:02.250,00:47:03.456,00:00:01.206,are you back at school yet,
668,6,1,00:47:05.015,00:47:07.427,00:00:02.412,,pause filler yeah my spring break was like two weeks ago
669,6,1,00:47:08.313,00:47:08.930,00:00:00.617,oh wow,
670,6,1,00:47:09.372,00:47:09.570,00:00:00.198,,yeah
671,6,1,00:47:12.930,00:47:15.410,00:00:02.480,my spring break I go back on Wednesday,
672,6,1,00:47:15.410,00:47:20.980,00:00:05.570,but the reason we had such a long break is there's this big debate thing at my school that�s been going on a week,
673,6,1,00:47:21.064,00:47:23.225,00:00:02.161,so it was like you know,
674,6,1,00:47:23.572,00:47:24.095,00:00:00.523,,oh okay
675,6,1,00:47:24.909,00:47:27.760,00:00:02.851,so it's like I think we're supposed to go back last week or something,
676,6,1,00:47:27.760,00:47:29.686,00:00:01.926,but we're not going back until Wednesday,
677,6,1,00:47:30.620,00:47:32.162,00:00:01.542,because my break started on the eighteenth,
678,6,1,00:47:32.799,00:47:34.854,00:00:02.055,so we had a really long break this year,
679,6,1,00:47:34.854,00:47:36.022,00:00:01.168,it's never this long,
680,6,1,00:47:36.371,00:47:37.339,00:00:00.968,I'm guessing that�s all right,
681,6,1,00:47:37.339,00:47:38.237,00:00:00.898,I'm just going to guess,
682,6,1,00:47:38.237,00:47:38.855,00:00:00.618,that�s all right,
683,6,1,00:47:38.855,00:47:40.363,00:00:01.508,and go to the next page,
684,6,1,00:47:43.149,00:47:46.717,00:00:03.568,so the the real question here should I add sixty-five or twenty-five,
685,6,1,00:47:43.183,00:47:43.482,00:00:00.299,,okay
686,6,1,00:47:46.717,00:47:48.054,00:00:01.337,I'm going to add sixty-five you know,
687,6,1,00:48:10.890,00:48:12.149,00:00:01.259,,it's a fraction I think
688,6,1,00:48:12.149,00:48:13.007,00:00:00.858,,yeah it is
689,6,1,00:48:14.195,00:48:15.816,00:00:01.621,twenty ninths,
690,6,1,00:48:18.200,00:48:22.825,00:00:04.625,four two point two repeating,
691,6,1,00:48:23.953,00:48:25.050,00:00:01.097,,two
692,6,1,00:48:26.258,00:48:27.520,00:00:01.262,two point two repeating,
693,6,1,00:48:30.508,00:48:32.591,00:00:02.083,okay let's try this one,
694,6,1,00:48:51.704,00:48:53.799,00:00:02.095,,wow oh okay (laughter)
695,6,1,00:48:55.079,00:48:56.779,00:00:01.700,wait where are you getting that from,
696,6,1,00:48:57.118,00:48:59.045,00:00:01.927,,on the side or something there's like
697,6,1,00:48:59.781,00:49:04.754,00:00:04.973,whoa coloring in the circle,
698,6,1,00:49:05.881,00:49:08.018,00:00:02.137,,okay anyways pause filler
699,6,1,00:49:12.072,00:49:14.089,00:00:02.017,and this is why you don�t let me have technology,
700,6,1,00:49:14.089,00:49:14.691,00:00:00.602,okay,
701,6,1,00:49:16.545,00:49:19.563,00:00:03.018,thirty-three so then you get negative,
702,6,1,00:49:21.409,00:49:25.752,00:00:04.343,two hundred equals one hundred x and then negative two equals x,
703,6,1,00:49:25.752,00:49:27.354,00:00:01.602,long story short there you go,
704,6,1,00:49:29.400,00:49:31.100,00:00:01.700,,okay I lost my attempt drawing Harry Potter
705,6,1,00:49:32.672,00:49:35.554,00:00:02.882,I never actually read Harry Potter nor do I ever plan to,
706,6,1,00:49:36.408,00:49:38.072,00:00:01.664,I'm I'm a sinner,
707,6,1,00:49:38.263,00:49:39.918,00:00:01.655,I know I'm terrible,
708,6,1,00:49:41.100,00:49:42.263,00:00:01.163,leave me alone,
709,6,1,00:49:42.445,00:49:48.218,00:00:05.773,there's plenty of other totally dorky fandoms I'm in but Harry Potter happens to not be one of them,
710,6,1,00:49:55.018,00:50:05.900,00:00:10.882,forty-two forty-one yup forty-one y plus thirty-seven minus thirty-seven y you add the thirty-seven just to subtract it,
711,6,1,00:50:07.627,00:50:08.661,00:00:01.034,,okay pause filler
712,6,1,00:50:09.563,00:50:15.918,00:00:06.355,so that would be twelve equals forty-one y,
713,6,1,00:50:17.645,00:50:21.454,00:00:03.809,and then you just get twelve forty-first equals one,
714,6,1,00:50:23.027,00:50:23.305,00:00:00.278,oop,
715,6,1,00:50:26.200,00:50:27.891,00:00:01.691,,oh this has so many numbers
716,6,1,00:50:29.372,00:50:32.636,00:00:03.264,oh math in general,
717,6,1,00:50:34.200,00:50:35.827,00:00:01.627,why can I oh there we go,
718,6,1,00:50:39.491,00:50:43.354,00:00:03.863,okay I guess I'll start with subtracting sixty-one,
719,6,1,00:50:45.845,00:50:46.354,00:00:00.509,,okay
720,6,1,00:50:47.645,00:50:56.391,00:00:08.746,so then you would get two hundred and six minus thirty-three z,
721,6,1,00:50:57.927,00:51:03.609,00:00:05.682,ah this reminds me of like writing calligraphy because you have to (inaudible),
722,6,1,00:51:03.972,00:51:05.336,00:00:01.364,so that would be,
723,6,1,00:51:08.809,00:51:14.645,00:00:05.836,sixty-seven two hundred and sixty-seven equals one,
724,6,1,00:51:15.427,00:51:18.805,00:00:03.378,oh my god one hundred and thirty-four z divide out,
725,6,1,00:51:19.481,00:51:20.871,00:00:01.390,divide out long story shorter,
726,6,1,00:51:20.871,00:51:24.672,00:00:03.801,it ends up being like two or something right I don�t,
727,6,1,00:51:24.683,00:51:27.164,00:00:02.481,,pause filler wait let's
728,6,1,00:51:27.176,00:51:31.596,00:00:04.420,yeah or no it would be like one and one hundred something,
729,6,1,00:51:33.518,00:51:36.909,00:00:03.391,okay now that's a lot of numbers,
730,6,1,00:51:39.345,00:51:42.821,00:00:03.476,pause filler I don't know what I'm doing,
731,6,1,00:51:43.236,00:51:47.991,00:00:04.755,,well you could start by subtracting the fifty
732,6,1,00:51:49.218,00:51:52.509,00:00:03.291,,or adding these
733,6,1,00:51:53.609,00:51:54.327,00:00:00.718,or I'll subtract,
734,6,1,00:51:54.491,00:51:56.191,00:00:01.700,yeah that�s a good idea thank you,
735,6,1,00:51:56.300,00:52:04.809,00:00:08.509,negative sixty p minus one hundred and forty equals negative fifteen p plus fifty,
736,6,1,00:52:05.218,00:52:10.527,00:00:05.309,so then you can add forty to both side one forty thank you one forty to both sides,
737,6,1,00:52:10.536,00:52:16.554,00:00:06.018,so then you get negative sixty p equals negative fifteen p plus,
738,6,1,00:52:18.000,00:52:22.872,00:00:04.872,ninety ninety no one hundred and ninety ps,
739,6,1,00:52:25.181,00:52:28.746,00:00:03.565,and then add fifteen p so then you get seventy negative ,
740,6,1,00:52:30.354,00:52:31.063,00:00:00.709,no wait,
741,6,1,00:52:32.127,00:52:33.873,00:00:01.746,wait just fix up you get,
742,6,1,00:52:34.818,00:52:38.963,00:00:04.145,negative forty-five p equals one hundred and ninety,
743,6,1,00:52:38.963,00:52:42.900,00:00:03.937,and then divide out by forty-five and by forty-five,
744,6,1,00:52:45.400,00:52:48.409,00:00:03.009,forty I want to say forty-five times like ,
745,6,1,00:52:50.999,00:52:52.759,00:00:01.760,,pause filler
746,6,1,00:52:52.745,00:52:56.791,00:00:04.046,four no not four,
747,6,1,00:52:56.791,00:52:57.381,00:00:00.590,maybe,
748,6,1,00:52:58.700,00:53:02.281,00:00:03.581,,wait so you have negative forty-five r equals a hundred ninety and then
749,6,1,00:53:02.463,00:53:11.636,00:00:09.173,so actually you get four and two ninths negative four and two ninths equals r,
750,6,1,00:53:27.536,00:53:30.551,00:00:03.015,(sfx),
751,6,1,00:53:30.527,00:53:33.109,00:00:02.582,,okay I guess we should go to the next
752,6,1,00:53:34.281,00:53:35.772,00:00:01.491,hey we only have one more,
753,6,1,00:53:37.691,00:53:40.300,00:00:02.609,did you find that I feel like you had twenty-three problems,
754,6,1,00:53:40.300,00:53:41.581,00:00:01.281,I feel like there was an extra one,
755,6,1,00:53:41.600,00:53:42.209,00:00:00.609,,yeah I think I did
756,6,1,00:53:43.491,00:53:46.163,00:00:02.672,I'm sorry that sucks,
757,6,1,00:53:46.691,00:53:49.136,00:00:02.445,,we only got to like twenty-one though so
758,6,1,00:53:51.545,00:53:54.127,00:00:02.582,either I'm really fast at math or I'm doing it wrong,
759,6,1,00:53:55.336,00:53:56.509,00:00:01.173,,no you're going pretty fast
760,6,1,00:53:57.436,00:53:59.100,00:00:01.664,I guess it's because I did this already,
761,6,1,00:54:08.554,00:54:10.818,00:00:02.264,oh it's so hard to read your own handwriting on this thing,
762,6,1,00:54:11.054,00:54:11.463,00:00:00.409,,yeah
763,6,1,00:54:13.200,00:54:16.009,00:00:02.809,it keeps like going a little crazy on me oh my god,
764,6,1,00:54:18.036,00:54:18.918,00:00:00.882,well,
765,6,1,00:54:21.336,00:54:26.327,00:00:04.991,let's see here so you have fifty y so you have one hundred and thirty,
766,6,1,00:54:26.927,00:54:32.272,00:00:05.345,no one hundred and fifty-five equals or no,
767,6,1,00:54:32.381,00:54:34.827,00:00:02.446,well I added the five so it would be one hundred and sixty,
768,6,1,00:54:38.109,00:54:42.763,00:00:04.654,equals fifty y and then divide out by fifty divide out by fifty,
769,6,1,00:54:42.763,00:54:44.681,00:00:01.918,and then you get three and,
770,6,1,00:54:45.800,00:54:46.554,00:00:00.754,one well,
771,6,1,00:54:46.645,00:54:46.972,00:00:00.327,,three
772,6,1,00:54:47.163,00:54:49.736,00:00:02.573,actually we'll do three point two equals y,
773,6,1,00:54:50.963,00:54:52.263,00:00:01.300,,wait was it one hundred and fifty
774,6,1,00:54:52.791,00:54:54.536,00:00:01.745,,was this a hundred and fifty or a hundred sixty
775,6,1,00:54:55.109,00:54:55.936,00:00:00.827,one sixty,
776,6,1,00:54:56.400,00:54:56.700,00:00:00.300,,oh okay
777,6,1,00:54:57.036,00:54:58.945,00:00:01.909,but they wrote one fifty on it (inaudible),
778,6,1,00:55:00.218,00:55:01.654,00:00:01.436,,and it was divided by five
779,6,1,00:55:01.909,00:55:03.172,00:00:01.263,,no it was divided by fifty
780,6,1,00:55:03.509,00:55:06.491,00:00:02.982,,oh okay yeah it's close to that somewhere
781,6,1,00:55:04.915,00:55:05.193,00:00:00.278,yeah yeah,
782,6,1,00:55:07.409,00:55:13.645,00:00:06.236,yeah that�s okay here I'll write it better one hundred and sixty over fifty,
783,6,1,00:55:15.381,00:55:19.891,00:00:04.510,equals fifty y wait (inaudible),
784,6,1,00:55:20.536,00:55:24.836,00:00:04.300,so that would make y three point two,
785,6,1,00:55:27.000,00:55:27.391,00:00:00.391,there,
786,6,1,00:55:28.491,00:55:29.554,00:00:01.063,,whoo we've finished
